# Changelog
All notable changes to "TextClass-Benchmark" will be documented in this file. No changelogging: Annotated data of new models, leaderboard updates, new ELO ratings and minor corrections because all of them are steps for cycle updating, and the outcome is published directly on https://textclass-benchmark.com.
