"The Working Families Party, which describes itself as a “multiracial party that fights for workers over bosses and people over the powerful,” is backing Judge Daniel McCaffery for Pennsylvania Supreme Court. As the progressive Working Families Party looks to increase its influence in the Keystone State, it views the Supreme Court race as an important one to be involved in. In a statement to the Capital-Star, Joe Dinkin, campaigns director for the party, noted that McCaffery has been backed by reproductive rights organizations and unions. He repeated a charge that has been levied repeatedly against Republican candidate Carolyn Carluccio during the campaign, that she is “trying to hide her past positions on abortion and cannot be trusted.” McCaffery, a Democrat serving as a judge on the Pennsylvania Superior Court, is facing Carluccio, a Republican serving as a judge on the Montgomery County Court of Common Plea. The seat was left vacant by the death of Justice Max Baer, in September 2022. Democrats currently hold a 4-2 majority on the court."

After presiding over the most humiliating military defeat in modern history , our commander in chief left Americans behind in Afghanistan . Biden ’ s decision to abandon U.S. citizens and our allies behind enemy lines shocked the nation . After the utter debacle in Afghanistan , no one will be shocked to hear that U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services has changed its mission statement to reflect the fact that it no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ securing the homeland ” to be part of its duties . USCIS ’ mission statement formerly read ( emphasis added ) : “ U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services administers the nation ’ s lawful immigration system , safeguarding its integrity and promise by efficiently and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits while protecting Americans , securing the homeland , and honoring our values. ” On Wednesday , the agency unveiled the new version , which reads : “ USCIS upholds America ’ s promise as a nation of welcome and possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all we serve. ” In announcing the change , USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou declared that it “ reflects the inclusive character of both our country and USCIS ” as well as “ America ’ s promise as a nation of welcome and possibility today and for generations to come. ” Actually , director , it reflects the Biden administration ’ s utter disregard for the rule of law . The USCIS changed its mission statement to one that more accurately matches its goals . Proponents of open borders are quick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immigrants . And immigration is a wonderful thing — when it ’ s done legally . The key words in the previous statement were “ lawful immigration system. ” Until they are changed or repealed by Congress , U.S. immigration laws remain in force — and this administration flagrantly violates them every day . The Democratic Party is flouting the law because it is focused on importing a huge new bloc of future Democratic voters . However , this strategy isn ’ t working out quite as it had hoped . Hispanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to desert the party . In the early months of Biden ’ s presidency , Americans watched in horror as throngs of illegal immigrants began streaming over our newly open southern border . And one year later , the damage done to our once great country is starting to reveal itself . The porous border has allowed criminals into the U.S. , which has contributed to skyrocketing levels of crime in cities throughout the country . Providing food , shelter and medical care for these people has strained our financial resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border are killing young Americans at a frightening pace . In an early January news release , U.S. Customs and Border Patrol reported that in the fiscal year ended Sep. 30 , seizures of fentanyl had increased by a whopping 1,066 percent and seizures of cocaine by 98 percent over the previous year . How much fentanyl and other drugs came into the country undetected ? Obviously one heck of a lot . Fox News reported in December that fentanyl overdoses had become the leading cause of death among U.S. adults ages 18-45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new mission statement said , “ Last year , USCIS leadership empowered employees to submit words that they felt best illustrated the agency ’ s work . The new mission statement is a reflection of this feedback from the workforce , the priorities of the Biden Administration , and Director Jaddou ’ s vision for an inclusive and accessible agency. ” The most fundamental duties of a government are to protect its citizens from harm and to provide law and order . USCIS ’ primary goal should be to protect Americans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Biden administration ignores both . Under this administration , it pays to be an illegal immigrant , a member of a cartel , a terrorist , a domestic criminal or at least a far-left progressive . It ’ s a terrible time to be a law-abiding citizen in America . """""""
"Liberal friends often ask me: “We know you don’t like Trump or Biden, but is there any Democrat you could support, or at least tolerate, if Biden doesn’t run?” Tough one. In the past I’ve said nice things about Ed Rendell in Pennsylvania and our own Jerry Brown. I wish Brown were 10 years younger. He did well as Oakland’s mayor and had a good second term as governor. Sure, he still has moonbeamish ideas, but he has a first-class mind and is a proven fiscal tightwad, which drove his fellow progressives crazy. Plus, he has about 50 IQ points on Biden. But the one Dem I might support, if he showed any interest, is Rahm Emanuel, currently our ambassador to Japan. Smart, tough, profane, balanced, successful. Broad political experience in both elected and appointed positions. Has two exceptional brothers (no Billy Carter or Roger Clinton worries). Doesn’t suffer fools. Now you know."
"The Enlightenment-era understanding of self-determination was at the center of the founding of the United States. Today, the very idea that governments should exist to protect individuals’ natural rights, including life, liberty and property—or as Thomas Jefferson phrased it, “the pursuit of happiness”—is being threatened by a radical right-wing of the Republican Party. They believe they should determine which personal liberties are protected and which should be restricted. Theirs is a narrow worldview based on misguided religious passions and a belief in their superiority over other citizens—a view untempered by reason or logic. Also among them is a political class willing to use cultural divisions to win elections. Currently, these radicals are engaged in a so-called culture war here in Alabama, targeting teachers, university faculty, librarians, families with transgender children, and women—they always target women first. For some culture warriors, the complexities of modern society are viewed as dangerous and a threat to their way of life. For political operatives, culture wars are a useful tactic to create a fear of “the others.”"
""""""" This Election Day marks 10 years since voters in Colorado and Washington state legalized weed . More states soon followed , and today , 19 have legalized the still federally illegal drug , while another 20 or so allow medical use . Legal weed is here to stay . Most people like it . A November 2021 Gallup poll found 68 percent of the public supports nationwide legalization . More than 80 percent of Democrats favor it , and Republicans are evenly split . In 2020 , five states of varying hues voted on medical or recreational use—Arizona , Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Dakota—and all of them passed it . It outperformed Joe Biden in every case . “ Legalization illustrates the power of voting more than any other issue in living memory , ” Sam D ’ Arcangelo , director of the Cannabis Voter Project at Headcount , a non-profit that registers voters at concerts , festivals and other events , said . “ It ’ s a way government has improved lives. ” Thus far , however , legalization has played only a marginal role in national electoral politics . There are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get elected taking away the people ’ s weed , and pot-skeptical pols have learned to evolve or keep quiet . Second , they can get away with that silence because many legalization supporters running for office aren ’ t comfortable making it a centerpiece of their campaigns anyway . Third , the importance of state ballot initiatives in advancing legalization further distances the issue from the campaigns of individual politicians . The result is often that both sides ’ major candidates ignore , and therefore neutralize , the weed vote . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could set the tone for several election cycles to come . Federal legalization is on Congress ’ agenda for the first time since the Carter administration . Almost all observers expect it to happen this decade . More immediately , legalization differentiates the candidates in at least four of November ’ s marquee races : Texas governor , Pennsylvania Senate , and Florida ’ s gubernatorial and Senate races . Though legalization is among the least partisan issues out there , each contest pits a pro-legalization Democrat against a Republican who opposes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as recently put by legalization supporter Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon , is that , “ No one has paid a political price ever for supporting cannabis. ” In this year ’ s races , we ’ ll see if anyone pays a price for opposing it . Sixteen percent of Americans—more than 50 million people—say they smoke marijuana . The key untested question is how much their use decides their vote , or convinces them to vote , in a way that decides elections . It ’ s not a question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weed is something that many people don ’ t take seriously . That could be a mistake . The stigma against pot is powerful enough that in 2020 neither presidential candidate endorsed legalization , despite likely knowing that the decision was costing him votes . ( Perhaps no other issue has this distinction . ) Support for legalization has become the default Democratic position . But during the 2020 campaign , Biden only promised to decriminalize it nationwide and expunge federal cannabis-use convictions . He hasn ’ t done either , angering cannabis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s imprisonment in Russia has outraged the world and cast a harsh light on the thousands of Americans incarcerated for pot offenses . Biden ’ s calculus may be that he is aiming to avoid alienating the centrist and swing voters whom he credits with his electoral victory . But in reality , many of those voters support legalization . I suspect that he and Trump , who as young men in the 1960s had nothing to do with “ the ’ 60s , ” have an inchoate sense that legal marijuana is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to associate themselves with it . Either way , they underestimated the weed vote . Legalization supporter Rep. Earl Blumenauer argues that Arizona ’ s 2020 cannabis ballot initiative won Biden the election . With 60 percent support for legalization , the initiative won by more than 600,000 votes , compared to Biden ’ s margin of about 10,500 . The states voting to legalize medical or recreational this November , include Maryland , Missouri , South Dakota , North Dakota and possibly Oklahoma and Arkansas aren ’ t also hosting key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not merely a matter of delivering more Democrat-leaning voters to the polls . There is a population of single-issue voters who would have switched their 2020 vote from Biden to Trump , or vice versa , if either supported legalization . No one knows how many people feel this way . There may be more than you ’ d think : For many cannabis users , the plant isn ’ t just a way to relax , or even their medicine , it ’ s also a social-justice movement and an industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are votes and campaign donations waiting for whomever assumes the mantle of tokers ’ rights . Even in legal states , cannabis users still face an array of challenges . California , for example , recently enacted laws that bar doctors from discriminating against cannabis users—denying them organ transplants , for example—and prohibit employers from punishing most workers for off-the-clock use . Another new law in the state requires cannabis use to be considered like alcohol , rather than other federally illegal drugs , in determining child-custody cases . Cannabis users generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just a few ways that show how there are votes and campaign donations waiting for whomever assumes the mantle of tokers ’ rights . The candidate who comes closest is probably Pennsylvania ’ s earthy lieutenant governor and Democratic Senate candidate , John Fetterman , who has weed leaves on his campaign merch . Fetterman ’ s longstanding support for legalization fits his everyman persona and he ’ s even hectored Biden on the issue , which polled at 60 percent in Pennsylvania last year . Fetterman ’ s opponent , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird ad in which a bong emerges from Fetterman ’ s animatronic head . It ’ s not often that candidates mock industries employing 25,000 of their would-be constituents . Legalization is another reason not to bet against Fetterman , who ’ s already the favorite in his race . But for weed to emerge as a major campaign issue in 2024 , it probably needs to figure in an upset . In Texas , the medical industry is very limited , but full legalization has 55 percent support . Next-door Oklahoma has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one 24-hour dispensary on the states ’ border . If Democrat candidate and former Rep. Beto O ’ Rourke wins , or even outperforms his race ’ s polling , support for weed will be a reason why . The odds for weed delivering a clear electoral payoff might be best in Florida , home to the country ’ s largest medical-only weed market . Stalwart legalization opponent Sen. Marco Rubio , has a narrow lead against Rep. Val Demmings , who has voted several times for legalization and other reforms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure-to-be future presidential candidate Ron DeSantis has expressed his distaste for the plant ’ s “ putrid ” smell . But for a politician who ’ s built his reputation as a right-wing culture warrior , DeSantis hasn ’ t picked this fight . Brady Cobb , the politically savvy CEO of Florida-based Sunburn Cannabis , told me DeSantis has quietly streamlined the regulation process and taken other steps that benefit the industry . Cobb doesn ’ t expect DeSantis to get in the way when Floridians vote on full legalization , likely @ @ @ """""""

"These questions were gaining salience even before the 2020 election. As Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins, explained in her 2018 book, “Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity”: The election of Trump is the culmination of a process by which the American electorate has become deeply socially divided along partisan lines. As the parties have grown racially, religiously and socially distant from one another, a new kind of social discord has been growing. The increasing political divide has allowed political, public, electoral and national norms to be broken with little to no consequence. The norms of racial, religious and cultural respect have deteriorated. Partisan battles have helped organize Americans’ distrust for “the other” in politically powerful ways. In this political environment, a candidate who picks up the banner of “us versus them"" and “winning versus losing” is almost guaranteed to tap into a current of resentment and anger across racial, religious and cultural lines, which have recently divided neatly by party. Most recently, these questions have been pushed to the fore by two political scientists at Harvard, Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, who published “Tyranny of the Minority” a month ago."

""""""" ( Stillness in the Storm Editor ) Benjamin Fulford is the former Toyko Bureau Chief of Forbes Magazine , who claims to have insider connections . He issues weekly reports that Stillness in the Storm has been reposting for years . See the section below his newsletter for our commentary on his reports . The following is only half of the full report , in honor of Ben ’ s wishes . The remaining portion will be updated to this article on Wednesday night , along with being posted as an independent article . We ’ re committed to sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are signs in multiple countries that some sort of world revolution is underway . These include a power struggle in China , riots in Iran , military mobilization by Russia , a declaration of war by Texas , royal unrest in the UK and much more . What all this points to is some sort of historical worldwide black swan event , possibly in October . Let us start with the events in China . The internet was all abuzz with rumors triggered by the Jennifer Zeng report linked below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out she is a member of the Falun Gong cult run out of the US State Department by Khazarian Mafia honcho Elliott Abrams . Nonetheless , the report appeared to be highly credible . It shows a video of an 80-kilometer military convoy moving to surround the capital of Beijing . It notes there was a major meeting of Chinese military commanders that did not include Xi Jinping , the nominal head of the Chinese military . The two military-linked politburo members at the meeting very unusually did not mention Xi in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern general , who was supposed to have been fired by Xi , was sitting in a front row seat at the meeting . Also , Xi apparently quickly abandoned the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit meeting in Uzbekistan and hurried back to China but has not been seen in public since . There is a real power rift in China between the military/intelligence group around Jiang Zemin and the group around Xi Jinping . There can be no doubt a major power struggle is taking place between the two groups . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator for life at the big , once-in-five-year Chinese Communist Party meeting taking place in October . The other is violently opposed to Xi and the personality cult surrounding him . An Asian secret society source close to Xi assured us the rumors were false and Xi was fine . Our sources close to Jiang did not return our messages . The last thing we note is that the move against Xi took place after he refused to meet the Khazarian Mafia agent posing as Pope Francis in Kazakhstan . The Pope was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ” in the would-be KM world capital of Astana . Here is a photograph from a concert at that meeting sent to us by Polish intelligence . In any case , there can be no doubt the Chinese government is under attack because it has been telling the world inconvenient truths about the real track record of the West , In the latest example , China has accused the US of illegally stealing 80 % of Syria ’ s oil production even as more than 14 million Syrians are in dire need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western sanctions . Our advice to the Chinese is to find out who is paying massive bribes for the widespread use of fraudulent PCR tests and using them to try to turn China into a giant animal farm . Whoever they are , they need to be removed from all positions of power and control over money . We urge the Iranian authorities to do the same and arrest all pandemic pushers . There riots are taking place in over 80 cities as the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini lies critically ill. Iranian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rothschild agent and his death will offer a chance to overthrow KM rule . However , with rioters being shot by policemen on motorcycles , any overthrow is likely to be bloody . Now let us look at the situation in Russia where Presidential Avatar Vladimir Putin ordered the first military mobilization of civilians since World War II . Russian FSB sources say the mobilization was triggered because a well-armed and well-trained military group led by NATO officers attacked their forces in Ukraine . The Russians say 300,000 additional troops have been mobilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to 1 million . Russia also organized plebiscites in order to make the territories in the Ukraine it controls legally part of Russia . This would make an attack on them a legitimate casus belli or reason for war . Polish intelligence confirms large amounts of UK and US troops have been deployed in Poland in response to the Russian move . MI6 sources say “ We would never comment upon our troops nor their location [ but ] the Russo Ukrainian Conflagration is in escalation so there will be general mobilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all highly orchestrated to result in full all-out thermonuclear war by 2025. ” Next , let us look at the situation in Texas where Governor Greg Abbott today issued an executive order designating Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations and instructing the Texas Department of Public Safety ( DPS ) to take immediate action to keep Texans safe . “ This is very important . How many are aware that a Governor can declare war ? ” a CIA source notes . “ This opens a way for the military to step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , ” the source adds . Our own sources in Arizona note that large amounts of military-age Chinese and Russian men have entered the US under the guise of being members of Mexican cartels which would definitely be a casus belli . The Governor also sent a letter to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris requesting federal terrorist classifications for the Sinaloa Cartel and Jalisco New Generation Cartel , as well as other cartels producing and distributing deadly fentanyl . This means that if Biden and the Rockefeller cabalists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the open border situation , it could trigger a civil war .

I decided to add this general comment to all Fulford reports since I frequently receive the same questions about them . In response to many questions and comments I receive from people wondering why I share these reports , I offer the following . Speaking as someone who has been following Fulford ’ s reports since 2011 , reading them should probably be done with a large grain of salt . That is to say , he seems to share information directly from alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Dragon Society , and so on . Often the data presented is contradictory on the surface . The predictions and statements Fulford makes sometimes are highly accurate , whereas , in other instances , they are completely unfounded . Instead of looking to Fulford as one who is “ tapped into ” some greater truth , it would probably be more productive to consider his data as one possible perspective on what is happening on Earth at this time . This of course extends to all sources of information . Fulford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human and can make mistakes . But that doesn ’ t detract from the work he has done to spread awareness and move things forward to a brighter future for humanity . Discernment is the process of understanding what something is , which in Fulford ’ s case , means entertaining his reports without believing them blindly , and then doing the follow-up research/fact-checking to determine what actually happened . In this way , it is a real-time discernment exercise . The fact that so many people continue to read his reports despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times—while also being accurate and poignant—means the people he receives information from are probably using him as a mouthpiece to speak to you—the reader who is on their awakening path . As such , blind belief or callous rejection are not our allies but critical thinking and open-mindedness are . As I have said before , if he is serving as a mouthpiece for various groups working to change the status quo or agents within the Cabal , we can decipher the data as if it is a form of awakening propaganda—information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . What effect this has on your personal process is largely up to you . But I would suggest taking an active role in discernment and not falling into the trap of total acceptance or rejection .

"Most Americans will never serve on a jury — in fact, most won’t even be summoned. The National Center for State Courts estimates that in any year, only about .09% of the population is called for jury duty, and yet somehow most New Yorkers will tell you they’ve gone at least once. I was called three times in my 20s and 30s. One of the cases involved a suspect who took off during a traffic stop, with the cop’s arm stuck in the window, dragging him for blocks. During voir dire, the defense attorneys wanted to know if any potential jurors would be overly sympathetic to cops. At the time I was a pundit on Fox News and belonged to several Republican clubs and organizations. Upon learning this, the lawyers asked me, “Would you say you’re a typical law-and-order Republican”?

"(JTA) — Shortly after Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,400, wounding thousands and taking 200 captive, Israel declared war and vowed to defeat the terror group. Since then, Israel has conducted punishing airstrikes in Gaza, killing thousands and preparing for a ground invasion as it is still counting bodies and learning of atrocities from Hamas’ incursion. It is also exchanging fire with Hezbollah, the Lebanese terror group, and cracking down in the West Bank. The international response has also changed: alongside widespread horror at Hamas’ mass murder, Israel and its supporters are calling for a return of the hostages while its critics are pushing for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza. President Joe Biden has staunchly backed Israel, traveling to the country this week and delivering an Oval Office address calling for aid — a question on which Americans appear split."

"HERNANDO — Gov. Tate Reeves rolled up in his blacked-out SUV to a DeSoto County church earlier this month to meet with conservative voters who felt uninspired about his first term in office. The closed-door meeting, held in a traditionally GOP stronghold county where Reeves earned 61% of the vote last election, provided some of those voters a chance to quiz the governor about his decisions the past few years and his ideas for the future. But importantly, it offered the governor an opportunity to mend relationships with members of a critical voting bloc he must win over to be reelected in November. Reeves, in a chaotic first term in the Governor’s Mansion, has regularly drawn criticism from right-wing Republicans — voters he’ll need support from to win reelection in November. Their list of frustrations with the governor has grown quite extensive."

"Even though he was the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Benny Gantz is not perceived by the public as a great strategist or as a former brave warrior on Israel’s battlefronts. He is also not considered to be a bold leader on the political battleground (in Israel today, it is indeed a battleground). Why is it then that in the past six months, he has been beating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in opinion polls? It’s precisely because of the above.

They start with a trip to Luton – end with a home match against Sheffield United , in the middle of which is a one-month season breaker to allow the Qatar World Cup to take place . The season starts on July 30 – just over five weeks away – and while we know the identity of Blues ’ opponents , we are less sure about which players will be taking part in that game . Indeed with the transfer window open for the whole first month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts at Kenilworth Road might not look much like the one which goes to Preston North End on September 3 . As things stand , with no signings made yet – a situation in which half of the division still find themselves – the only safe assumption in this summer of uncertainty is that the side will have a very familiar look to the one which played last term – minus sparkly bits . At the time of writing we are looking at a starting XI of something along the lines of Etheridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friend ; Woods , Gardner , Sunjic ; Graham , Deeney , Bacuna . Maybe , depending on formation . But even with the takeover still bubbling away in the background , Blues have continued to be linked with targets – and BirminghamLive understands there are long-lists of players in whom Blues are somewhere between smitten by and vaguely interested .

Not quite ‘ be still my beating heart ’ territory – but at least partially spiced up from the status quo . Jack Butland – Blues are interested in their former goalkeeper – whether he is interested in dropping into the Championship seems less likely . Let ’ s assume the heartstrings are tugged and he acquiesces . Maxime Colin – Played through injury last season , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a new starter is not really a priority . Alfie Mawson – A free agent after his release from Fulham , Blues tried for him in January and are still keen . Marc Roberts – Had a decent enough season at the heart of a back three , Championship standard centre half in a back four . Ian Maatsen – The left full/wing back looks set to leave Chelsea . Feyenoord have been extensively linked but after a good season with Coventry he ’ d be an intriguing prospect in what at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More of a wing back ... Gary Gardner – Recovered from a difficult first half of the season to end the campaign as Player of the Season after setting a new personal best in front of goal . Juninho Bacuna – Ideally you want your most skilful player further up the pitch but if we are ‘ dreaming ’ there ’ s such quality in attacking positions the 24-year-old will have to play slightly deeper . Ivan Sanchez – Yeah I know . He looks as though he ’ ll be heading back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him in the flesh and that ’ s a shame . Lovely on the ball , good work ethic off it and a sweet left foot . I ’ d like to see him swap wings from time to time .

Results : Compared with low vitamin Bintake ( < 1.7 mg/day ) , adequate vitamin Bintake ( ≥1.7 mg/day ) corresponded to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DSST tests . Participants who consumed adequate B ( ≥400 mcg/day ) were associated with 31.2 % , 33.8 % , and 46.5 % declines in the risk of LCP in the CERAD , AF , and DSST tests in contrast to those having low Bintake ( < 400 mcg/day ) . Adequate vitamin Bintake ( ≥2.4 mcg/day ) correlated with a lower LCP occurrence in the CERAD , AF , and DSST tests , with 30.5 % , 21.5 % , and 33.3 % reductions , respectively . Further , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance varied across different sex , race , and age groups of people . Conclusion : Adequate dietary vitamin Band Bintakes are significantly associated with a better cognitive performance in immediate and delayed memory recall , categorical verbal fluency , processing speed , sustained attention , and working memory among elders assessed in the CERAD , AF , and DSST tests .

"CLIMATEWIRE | Political battles over climate change are increasingly being fought in the classroom. Conservative activists and politicians in states across the country are trying to limit or distort the teaching of climate science to schoolchildren, marking a growing front in the culture war against social movements over race, gender identity and the environment. State education officials, local school board members and Republican lawmakers in states from Florida to Montana have tried to reshape climate curriculum over the last year, with varying success."

"The Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of U.S. House representatives co-chaired by New Jersey Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-Wyckoff), released a government funding proposal last night that would avert a looming government shutdown, which will happen if Congress can’t reach a deal by September 30. Under the caucus’s plan, Congress would temporarily fund the government through January 2024 via a continuing resolution (CR), a type of stopgap bill that Congress can pass if a full funding plan isn’t ready yet. The CR would include funds for Ukraine aid and disaster relief, two priorities of Democrats and the White House, as well as new border security controls that Republicans have pushed for. The next three months would then be dedicated to passing the 12 full appropriations bills necessary to fund the government long-term, with funding set at the levels agreed to under last spring’s Fiscal Responsibility Act."
"CNN — Former President Donald Trump continues to hold what has proven to be an unshakeable position atop the Republican field of candidates vying to take on President Joe Biden next year, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Trump is the top choice for his party’s nomination at the traditional Labor Day start to a more engaged campaign season, ahead of his nearest rival by more than 30 percentage points (52% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters support him, compared with 18% behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis). And Trump is broadly seen as best able to handle a wide range of issues."
"As director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, I sent this survey to roughly 2,600 GOP chairs, one for every county in the country; 108 Republican chairs responded, a bit lower than the number who responded in June, but still enough to do a robust analysis. This is the fourth survey I’ve conducted for this project, and the shifts in sentiment are starting to become notable. The first question I have asked is simply whether the county chairs have committed to supporting a candidate, and if so, whom that might be. When I launched my first survey in February, Trump was looking vulnerable and was roughly tied with DeSantis among those who had committed to a candidate. Then Trump started consolidating more support, largely after the wave of indictments began, and DeSantis began to dip. The most recent survey, conducted throughout August — with responses coming in both before and after the first GOP debate — show a slight softening of Trump’s support, but still with a substantial lead. As in June, roughly twice as many county party chairs are now committed to Trump (27 percent) than DeSantis (13 percent), and no other candidates had the support of more than 4 percent of chairs."

'' MARGARET BRENNAN : We turn now to former FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member , Dr. Scott Gottlieb . Good morning to you , doctor . MARGARET BRENNAN : Nine hundred thousand Americans have died over the last two years from COVID . That 's the population of Indianapolis , greater than the population of San Francisco , Charlotte , North Carolina . Where are we now as a country in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , we 're still tragically in this fight . I think when you look across the country right now , you see the cases declining very quickly all across the country . In almost every state , if you look week over week , cases have declined sharply . So we 're a good part of the way through this Omicron wave . If you look at places like New York , New Jersey , Maryland , cases are down to about 20 to 30 cases per 100,000 people per day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about where we were before the delta surge . Other parts of the country are still at about 100 cases per 100,000 people per day . One hundred and forty you look at states like North Carolina , South Carolina , Kentucky , right now , Oklahoma , they 're about at that level . So some parts of the country still are in the thick of their Omicron wave , coming down , but still in the thick of it . Other parts like New York , New Jersey , Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the leading indicators have come way down and I think that they 're through the worst of this particular wave of infection . MARGARET BRENNAN : And we 're hearing from governors , there was a bipartisan group of them that met with President Biden just in the past few days , saying they want guidelines to talk about moving from pandemic to an endemic stage here . And yet we 're at 2,400 deaths a day . That does n't feel like we 're close to the end . DR. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like that , and we 're not close to the end right now , depending on how you measure that . I think that this is going to be a long struggle . This is a virus that 's going to be persistent . We 're going to have to continue to take measures to protect vulnerable people . I think what governors are agitating for is some clear guideposts that define what the on and off ramp is for this . When do we start to roll back this mitigation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a set of nomenclature and metrics for measuring that . If you look at CDC right now , many state authorities and public health authorities talk about 10 cases per 100,000 people per day being a metric that rates you being in sort of a low level of spread . If you look at CDC 's guidance , they talk about 10 cases per 100,000 people per week . So that 's 1.44 cases a day . That 's a level of spread , a sufficiently low level of spread , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in this pandemic . And that 's where CDC defines a low level of spread that would justify removing masks , for example , in schools . And so I think what governors are sensing is that we need to- we need to agree upon a set of metrics when we 're going to start to roll back these mitigation steps and give people a light at the end of the tunnel . What is that point when this stuff gets turned off ? MARGARET BRENNAN : Well , you talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia , we talked about on this program , you know , lifted the mask mandate for schools and he on January 2nd 20- excuse me , on January 23rd when I asked you what should be done here , you said that was too early , but in two weeks we 'd be in a place where mask mandates could be lifted . So that puts us right where we are right now . Can mask mandates be lifted in most schools ? DR. GOTTLIEB : Look , I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . I think we 're two weeks out , we 've seen prevalence come down . Connecticut , their mask mandate is - expires on February 15th . I would expect that that 's not going to be renewed , and schools in the state of Connecticut will very quickly lift mask requirements for students . I think you 're going to see the same thing in New York , New Jersey , other states where Omicron has come down , where vaccination rates are especially high . I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we 're at a point where we can safely contemplate that . That does n't mean that this is n't going to continue to spread . But when prevalence is low , you have a lot of people who 've been infected who have some level of immunity for a period of time and you have high vaccination rates , we can start to lean forward and take a little bit more risk and try to at least make sure that students in schools have some semblance of normalcy for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't really known a normal school day for two years now , so we want to- we need to try to lean forward aggressively to try to restore that and reclaim it when we can . MARGARET BRENNAN : But then I 'm a parent of a young child who does n't have access to a vaccine yet . I do n't want to take a mask off of his face . When will he be vaccinated ? I mean , the FDA said they want to reconsider their earlier guidance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses . First week of March , do I go into a pediatric- pediatrician 's office and get a shot ? DR. GOTTLIEB : It 's possible , look , the decision is ultimately going to reside with the FDA . The briefing documents on the data that the FDA is going to review are going to be out this Friday . The agency is going to have an advisory committee , a public advisory committee on February 15th . After that , I would expect that they 'll make a decision on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to four years old , and they have a lot more data to evaluate . I think when people see that data come out , some of it will be out Friday in the briefing documents . All of it will be out in a public advisory committee meeting . I think that they 'll see that the data package has evolved from when they first looked at it back in December . And what 's happened over that intervening time is Omicron . 11.4 million children have been infected through this- through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were infected in just the month of January , and that was Omicron , and there were 1.6 million kids under the age of five infected over the course of the pandemic . So we now have a lot of experience of the kids in that trial who were vaccinated , who made it through the Omicron wave and we 'll be able to evaluate how protective that vaccine was . MARGARET BRENNAN : I know you used to run the FDA , but do you think the FDA made a mistake by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they had the first chance to do so ? GOTTLIEB : Look , I always felt that it was important to get baseline immunity in those children . Remember , Pfizer , the company I 'm on the board of , made a decision to test low doses in children ages six months to five years old because they wanted to find the lowest dose possible that provided some immune response but improved tolerability . By choosing a very low dose in the children , it 's a three microgram dose compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you improve the tolerability of the vaccine . But the sacrifice was that the absolute efficacy of the vaccine was n't as substantial as what you saw in 16 to 25 , and that 's the data they were looking at back in December . They saw that the immune response was n't as substantial , so they wanted to wait and see how those kids did . I still believe it was important to get baseline immunity in children ahead of the Omicron wave . They chose not to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to look at a much richer data set because they have the collective experience of all the kids who are enrolled in this trial who made it through Omicron . Some got infected , hopefully some did n't . I think that 's what the data package is going to show . And I think it 's going to give a much clearer picture of what the effectiveness of this vaccine is in Omicron . MARGARET BRENNAN : And then the open question is how many parents choose to take advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's always good to talk to you , and we 'll catch up with you next Sunday .

""""""" BIRMINGHAM , Ala. ( AP ) — For almost 40 years starting in the 1930s , as government researchers purposely let hundreds of Black men die of syphilis in Alabama so they could study the disease , a foundation in New York covered funeral expenses for the deceased . The payments were vital to survivors of the victims in a time and place ravaged by poverty and racism . Altruistic as they might sound , the checks - $ 100 at most - were no simple act of charity : They were part of an almost unimaginable scheme . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved ones had to consent to letting doctors slice open the bodies of the dead men for autopsies that would detail the ravages of a disease the victims were told was “ bad blood. ” Fifty years after the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study was revealed to the public and halted , the organization that made those funeral payments , the Milbank Memorial Fund , publicly apologized Saturday to descendants of the study ’ s victims . The move is rooted in America ’ s racial reckoning after George Floyd ’ s murder by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . We are ashamed of our role . We are deeply sorry , ” said the president of the fund , Christopher F. Koller . The apology and an accompanying monetary donation to a descendants ’ group , the Voices for Our Fathers Legacy Foundation , were presented during a ceremony in Tuskegee at a gathering of children and other relatives of men who were part of the study . Endowed in 1905 by Elizabeth Milbank Anderson , part of a wealthy and well-connected New York family , the fund was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations . The nonprofit philanthropy had some $ 90 million in assets in 2019 , according to tax records , and an office on Madison Avenue in Manhattan . With an early focus on child welfare and public health , today it concentrates on health policy at the state level . Koller said there ’ s no easy way to explain how its leaders in the 1930s decided to make the payments , or to justify what happened . Generations later , some Black people in the United States still fear government health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the “ Tuskegee effect. ” “ The upshot of this was real harm , ” Koller told The Associated Press in an interview before the apology ceremony . “ It was one more example of ways that men in the study were deceived . And we are dealing as individuals , as a region , as a country , with the impact of that deceit. ” Lillie Tyson Head ’ s late father Freddie Lee Tyson was part of the study . She ’ s now president of the Voices group . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a wonderful thing ” even if it comes 25 years after the U.S. government apologized for the study to its final survivors , who have all since died . “ It ’ s really something that could be used as an example of how apologies can be powerful in making reparations and restorative justice be real , ” said Head . Despite her leadership of the descendants group , Head said she didn ’ t even know about Milbank ’ s role in the study until Koller called her one day last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in academic studies and a couple books , but the descendants were unaware , she said . “ It really was something that caught me off guard , ” she said . Head ’ s father left the study after becoming suspicious of the research , years before it ended , and didn ’ t receive any of the Milbank money , she said , but hundreds of others did . Other prominent organizations , universities including Harvard and Georgetown and the state of California have acknowledged their ties to racism and slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote a book about the study , researched the Milbank Fund ’ s participation at the fund ’ s request . She said its apology could be an example for other groups with ties to systemic racism . ’ “ It ’ s really important because at a time when the nation is so divided , how we come to terms with our racism is so complicated , ” she said . “ Confronting it is difficult , and they didn ’ t have to do this . I think it ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restorative justice. ” Starting in 1932 , government medical workers in rural Alabama withheld treatment from unsuspecting Black men infected with syphilis so doctors could track the disease and dissect their bodies afterward . About 620 men were studied , and roughly 430 of them had syphilis . Reverby ’ s study said Milbank recorded giving a total of $ 20,150 for about 234 autopsies . Revealed by The Associated Press in 1972 , the study ended and the men sued , resulting in a $ 9 million settlement from which descendants are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in court records as “ relatively small. ” The Milbank Memorial Fund got involved in 1935 after the U.S. surgeon general at the time , Hugh Cumming , sought the money , which was crucial in persuading families to agree to the autopsies , Reverby found . The decision to approve the funding was made by a group of white men with close ties to federal health officials but little understanding of conditions in Alabama or the cultural norms of Black Southerners , to whom dignified burials were very important , Koller said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us is you get bad decisions if … your perspectives are not particularly diverse and you don ’ t pay attention to conflicts of interest , ” Koller said . The payments became less important as the Depression ended and more Black families could afford burial insurance , Reverby said . Initially named as a defendant , Milbank was dismissed as a target of the men ’ s lawsuit and the organization put the episode behind it . Years later , books including Reverby ’ s “ Examining Tuskegee , The Infamous Syphilis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2009 , detailed the fund ’ s involvement . But it wasn ’ t until after Floyd ’ s death at the hands of Minneapolis police that discussions among the Milbank staff - which is now much more diverse - prompted the fund ’ s leaders to reexamine its role , Koller said . “ Both staff and board felt like we had to face up to this in a way that we had not before , ” he said . Besides delivering a public apology to a gathering of descendants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to the Voices for Our Fathers Legacy Foundation , Koller said . The money will make scholarships available to the descendants , Head said . The group also plans a memorial at Tuskegee University , which served as a conduit for the payments and was the location of a hospital where medical workers saw the men . While times have changed since the burial payments were first approved nearly 100 years ago , Reverby also said there ’ s no way to justify what happened . “ The records say very clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . “ You don ’ t need a Ph.D. to figure that out , and they just kept doing it year after year . ” """""""

"NEW YORK (AP) — The end of Labor Day weekend would typically mark the start of a furious sprint to the Iowa caucuses as candidates battle for their party’s presidential nomination. But as the 2024 campaign comes into greater focus, the usual frenzy is yielding to a sense of inevitability. Among Republicans, Donald Trump is dominating the primary field, outpacing rivals with resumes as governors, diplomats and entrepreneurs that would normally prove compelling. The former president’s strength comes despite — or perhaps because of — multiple criminal indictments that threaten to overshadow any serious debate about the future of the country. And for now, the tens of millions of dollars that Republican rivals are pouring into the race are doing little to diminish Trump’s stature, fueling concerns among his GOP critics who fear the primary is essentially over before it begins. As one troubled front-runner tightens his grip on the Republican nomination, President Joe Biden is on a glide path to victory on the Democratic side. The 80-year-old incumbent is facing only token opposition for the Democratic nomination despite concerns about his age and performance from many within his own party."

After the service was performed on March 13 , 2020 , Thompson , who had only worked at the dealership for two months at that point , lowered the Jeep on an auto lift and tried to start it , the report stated .

Thompson told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s license , according to the report , and had never learned to operate a standard transmission .

Right now , America feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how all wars begin — by first saturating the battlefields with waves of invasive propaganda meant to shape the thoughts and deeds of the combatants .

The impositions of global “ green capitalism ” are not being pacifically accepted in all parts of Europe . Dutch farmers have started a popular insurrection against a bill that severely harms local agribusiness . The protests quickly spread , resulting in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries which have similar problems . With this , it is evident that the globalist pseudo-ecological agendas will not be so easily received in all countries and may face strong popular resistance . Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte intends to impose a law to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 70-95 % by 2030 . This gaseous chemical compound comes mainly from the urine of cattle , pigs and other animals , but can also be observed in the use of ammonia in fertilizers . Dutch farmers claim that this measure will result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the country ’ s farms , considering that rural workers could be banned from using fertilizers and would have to reduce the number of animals in their own properties . The protesters ’ dissatisfaction is also justified by the fact that nitrogen reduction measures are not imposed on other sectors of the economy , such as the airline industry – which makes the topic seem something like a specific attack against agribusiness , promoted by the environmentalist militants . In fact , agribusiness is a very important sector of the Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 55 thousand rural enterprises , totaling more than 95.4 billion euros . The instability of the sector has led to crises , tensions and instabilities . Farmers are protesting with full force , obstructing food supplies in cities , which is leading to shortages and rising prices . In several images and videos posted on internet it is possible to see supermarkets with empty shelves and people desperate in search of basic products . The farmers are led by Sieta van Keimpema , president of the “ Farmers Defense Force ” and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity of the demonstrations has increased in recent days precisely due to the government ’ s refusal to listen to the demands of rural producers , in addition to threats made repeatedly by the authorities to confiscate farms from agriculturalists who do not respect the new rules . The police reaction , as expected , has also been violent . Several arrests have already been made . In the second week of July agents went to the extreme of firing shots at the civilian population during some demonstrations , which has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . In addition , very strong blockades have been organized by the police , with cars forming barricades to prevent the insurgents from passing . The objective of the agents is to prevent the situation in the country from reaching absolute chaos , but in fact this seems to be getting closer and closer . As there are similar bills in other countries , Dutch farmers have received international support . Farmers in Italy , Poland and Germany also joined the demonstrations started by the Dutch . As the pressure to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with strong international incentives for the approval of measures against the emission of gases , the formation of a united front between rural workers from different countries is strengthened . These workers share in common the fear that the direct effects of such measures will lead to the bankruptcy of rural enterprises that guarantee the income of the European peasant population . On the other hand , the governments of such countries seem little concerned with such issues , being only committed to obeying the pro-green capitalism agendas imposed by international elites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic has been largely ignored by Western media agencies . In the headlines of the main western media , the issues most talked about are the Ukrainian conflict and the political crises around the world , but the case of European farmers remains largely ignored , despite the episode representing a potential continental crisis . The objective of this strategy is quite simple : to omit from the public opinion the arguments of the farmers and to spread the image that the environmental laws are “ positive for all ” . Something similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truck drivers ’ protests in Canada , when popular clamor against sanitary impositions were ignored by media agencies in order to prevent “ anti-vaccine riots ” from occurring around the world . In fact , what is happening is just another episode of confrontation between producers and ideological militants , where workers who generate material riches have their interests harmed by an agenda that , in the name of “ ecology ” , imposes norms that severely hurt the lives of ordinary citizens . It is obvious that environmental concerns are legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply chains can not be abruptly interrupted and modified just to seek “ ecologically correct ” results . In the same way that there is a human interest in preserving natural resources for future generations , there is a human interest in feeding the current population – and providing food in a satisfactory way will become impossible if Western governments continue to promote the failure of rural enterprises . This posture of submission by European governments to the agendas vertically imposed by the WEF will lead to a scenario of internal polarization with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing producers against decision-makers and ideological militants . Either European governments act sovereignly , banning globalist agendas that do not interest their people , or the political crisis that currently affects the continent will continue for many years to come .

""""""" Former President Donald Trump ’ s inaugural address clocked in at just 16 minutes . Closing arguments that are slated for Thursday in his company ’ s criminal tax fraud case ? Prosecutors and defense lawyers say those could take seven hours or more . Those projections speak to the complexity of the case , which stems from longtime Trump Organization finance chief Allen Weisselberg 's 15-year scheme to avoid taxes on company-paid perks including an apartment and luxury cars . The speeches are a chance to recap key witnesses and evidence before the jury deliberates next week . Prosecutors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours summarizing the case . Defense lawyers said they ’ ll likely need at least three hours . Seven witnesses testified , chief among them Weisselberg , who pleaded guilty in August to dodging taxes on $ 1.7 million in extras . Prosecutors charged the company because it said Weisselberg was a “ high managerial agent ” acting on its behalf and that it also benefitted from his scheme . Trump Organization lawyers argue Weisselberg acted on his own , without Trump or the Trump family ’ s knowledge . If anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should 've caught any fraud . Trump is not charged . If convicted , his company could be fined more than $ 1 million . Although there were just 10 days of testimony , the trial has stretched on since Halloween . That ’ s partly because Jeffrey McConney , the Trump Organization comptroller called as the first prosecution witness , tested positive for COVID-19 early on , halting the trial for eight days . Here ’ s a refresher on what ’ s happened so far . Prosecutors built their case around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plea deal in exchange for a promised sentence of five months in jail , and McConney , who was granted immunity to testify . Weisselberg , 75 , testified he and McConney conspired to hide extras from his income by fudging payroll records to deduct their cost from his salary and issuing falsified W-2 forms . The arrangement reduced Weisselberg ’ s tax liability but also saved the company money because it didn ’ t have to pay him more to cover the cost of the perks . “ It was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ” an emotional Weisselberg testified . McConney testified that Weisselberg and another executive , Michael Calamari Sr. , pressured him to alter payroll records . The company also provided no-or-low cost apartments to Calamari and Weisselberg 's son , who helped manage a company-run ice rink in Central Park . McConney said he feared he 'd be fired if he alerted Trump to the scheme . While Weisselberg struck a deal to be the prosecution ’ s star witness , he proved to be a star for the defense , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed how he and the Trump Organization both benefited from his scheme to avoid taxes on his company-paid perks — the crux of a prosecution that seeks to hold the company accountable for the sins of one of its most trusted figures . But Weisselberg also testified that neither Trump nor his family knew about his scheming while it was happening — a win for the company ’ s defense team whose mantra is “ Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg. ” Trump noticed , posting on social media while Weisselberg was testifying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' Weisselberg still works for the company and had a birthday party at Trump Tower in August , around the time of his plea . He is scheduled to be formally sentenced on Dec. 19 . The trial has also spotlighted other pay practices in place at the Trump Organization before Trump became president in 2017 , including a scheme to avoid taxes on holiday bonuses it paid executives . Weisselberg said the company paid executives as independent contractors by drawing bonus payments from subsidiary entities such as Mar-a-Lago and the company he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV show . That allowed the company to avoid payroll taxes and the subsidiaries to deduct the bonuses as expenses . Trump “ always wanted to sign the bonus checks , ” had then be stuffed into Christmas cards and handed them out like Santa Claus to executives around the building , Weisselberg said . McConney said the company abandoned that arrangement at the behest of a tax lawyer brought in to audit the company 's financial practices following Trump ’ s election . Trump didn ’ t attend the trial , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — and he signaled on social media that he 's been following the proceedings closely . “ The very unfair Manhattan D.A . Fringe Benefits Case , the likes of which has never been prosecuted in our Country before , has fallen apart , ” Trump wrote Tuesday on his Truth Social platform . “ There was no gain for ‘ Trump , ’ and we had no knowledge of it. ” Prosecutors gave mixed signals about Trump ’ s importance to the case , telling a judge early on “ This case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then repeatedly asking witnesses about him . Weisselberg described Trump as a hands-on boss prior to leaving for the White House . Defense lawyers and some witnesses made a point to refer to Trump as “ President Trump , ” leading to a humorous moment as McConney described his understanding of why the company had changed its pay practices . “ Nobody told me this change came specifically because Mr. Trump became President Trump , '' McConney said . CAN I HAVE THE DEFINITION , PLEASE ? How jurors decide the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense and prosecution spent hours Tuesday sparring over jury instructions , turning the tax case into a syntax case as they parsed the meaning of a single phrase — “ in behalf of ” — in the 1965 state law underlying some of the charges . A defense lawyer even read off a definition from a 1960s dictionary he found while digging through legislative records in Albany . It said “ in behalf of ” means “ for the primary purpose of benefiting. ” The defense argued that the way the phrase is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have shown that the Weisselberg intended to help the company ’ s bottom line , not just his own . Ultimately , it ’ ll be Judge Juan Manuel Merchan ’ s definition of “ in behalf of ” that jurors will have to rely on . He 's expected to instruct the jury in the law either Friday or Monday .

Minella Indo ( 7-1 ) was second ahead of Protektorat ( 10-1 ) . Galvin ( 10-3 ) came in fourth with Al Boum Photo - the winner in 2019 and 2020 - sixth .

But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Plus Tard waited patiently before showing a lovely turn of pace to take the lead and , once he did , there was only going to be one winner and the pair finished 15 lengths clear . It was 32-year-old Blackmore 's second feature race success of the week , after her win on Honeysuckle in Tuesday 's Champion Hurdle . While last year 's victories at Prestbury Park and Aintree had been achieved behind closed doors , this time Blackmore was roared home by a Cheltenham record crowd of 73,875 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra : `` I was happy with my position throughout the race - I had everyone in my sights that I wanted to keep an eye on .

"In the complex realm of contemporary Russia, social life has become a challenging cauldron of ideas, dissent, and resistance. Under the regime of President Vladimir Putin, the nation’s intellectual circles have traversed a disturbing path, marked by a delicate balance between self-expression and state control. It has been several weeks since Boris Kagarlitsky, a prominent figure in the Russian Leftist intellectual sphere, a distinguished social scientist and prolific political writer, was arrested. On July 25, an unexpected turn of events unfolded for Kagarlitsky as he was hurriedly arrested and transported over 1000 kilometres away from Moscow to Syktyvkar in the Komi Republic. On the same day, a local court ruled to detain him for a duration of two months, all emerging from allegations related to his purported support for ‘acts of terrorism’. The potential consequences of this situation loom large, as a guilty verdict from the court could subject Kagarlitsky to the grim possibility of a prison sentence extending up to seven years."

"Former Vice President Mike Pence in a speech before the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College and in an article in The Wall Street Journal warned Republicans and conservatives about the danger of populism. The former Vice President argues, in echoing Ronald Reagan’s 1964 address, that it is “a time for choosing” for Republicans whether to continue to follow the “siren song” of populism or return to true conservatism. It is clear that Pence is not only drawing a line in the sand and forcing a debate over conservatism, but also distancing himself from former President Donald Trump and those who support his policies. Nevertheless, Pence fails to understand that the conservative populism he is denouncing is actually rooted within the American conservative tradition. Debates within and amongst conservatives is nothing new. The conservative movement contains various “schools of intellectual thought” over what conservatism means and how conservatives should shape public policy. Vice President Pence argues that the Republican Party must return to traditional conservatism. “If we are to defeat Joe Biden and turn America around, the GOP must be the party of limited government, free enterprise, fiscal responsibility and traditional values,” wrote Pence. Pence is defining traditional conservatism based upon the principles of limited government, free enterprise, fiscal responsibility, and traditional values. Further, he correctly notes that individual “rights come from God and nature, not from the state.” In addition, Pence argues that just “like our founders, we know the imperfect nature of men and women and that granting them unlimited power imperils liberty.” This is an important pillar of conservatism, that is, that human nature is flawed because of original sin. Pence is also correct in referencing the need for conservatives to uphold and defend constitutional principles such as federalism."

( Justin Sullivan/Getty Images ) Soil in Danger : How Fixing Agricultural Soil Could Help the World Agricultural soil is an important resource for communities all over the world , not only because it provides humans with the majority of their food but because it also plays a major role in balancing the environment . Soil researchers have said investing in soil could help the world tap into an untold resource against environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . “ The degradation of soil resources has been occurring since the advent of agriculture , some 10,000 years ago , ” said the Assoc Head of Colorado State University ’ s Department of Soil and Crop Sciences , Prof. Francesca Cotrufo , and PhD student Sam Leuthold from Cotrufo ’ s Soil Innovation Laboratory . Cotrufo and Leuthold said that the intensity of this degradation had increased sharply since the industrial revolution and the introduction of mechanized farming equipment , which allowed for the expansion of agricultural lands into areas that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion and industrialization of livestock agriculture . “ Transforming naturally vegetated ecosystems into crop or grazing lands changes the carbon balance of these systems , ” the researchers said . Cotrufo and Leuthold said that unlike soil carbon stocks in their natural state , which tend to balance inputs and outputs , agricultural soils tend to lose more carbon than they gain when converted . This is because the growing season of annual crops is often shorter than that of natural perennial vegetation , and in agricultural systems , a significant portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during harvest . “ After a period of time , agricultural soils may reach a new steady state , but the new balance of inputs and outputs then exists at a lower level than prior to cultivation , and as a result , carbon is lost to the atmosphere , ” they said . “ Additionally , intensive tillage and fallowing of croplands , as well as intensive grazing by livestock , can lead to markedly increased levels of erosion of the carbon and nutrient-rich topsoil , either via wind or water. ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of degradation occurred across the North American plains in the 1930s after a prolonged drought combined with extensive amounts of intensive tillage brought about the Dust Bowl , the worst drought in United States history . “ Not all soil degradation events have eras named after them though—today , thousands of hectares of coastal cropland are at risk of salinization due to rising sea levels and increasing storm intensities , ” the researchers said . “ Inland soils face increased risk of desertification and loss of fertility due to overgrazing and expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arid and semi-arid regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and the Western United States are most vulnerable to this decline , as the lack of rainfall makes plants more difficult to reestablish after they have been removed. ” Additionally , soil scientists are still actively researching the impact that increasing climate variability has on different types of soil . Cotrufo and Leuthold said that this knowledge gap increases the difficulty of creating universal solutions for degradation . Healthy soil provides a list of “ ecosystem services ” —natural processes that assist in protecting human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these services can vary depending on the ecosystem ; they include things like reducing flood risk , lowering the number of nutrients lost to waterways and storing atmospheric carbon . “ During their growth , plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere . Most of this carbon is transformed into plant biomass , with a small portion also routed directly into the soil , as roots exude small carbon molecules. ” Cotrufo and Leuthold said that assuming the biomass isn ’ t removed through harvest or grazing and enters the soil system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the absorbed carbon will become food for microbial communities . The carbon that is consumed by such communities will eventually re-enter the atmosphere through microbial respiration ; however , if not respired , a portion of the absorbed carbon can become stabilized within the soil . Through bonding directly to soil minerals such as clay particles or by becoming protected within soil aggregates where microorganisms take time to reach it , carbon can become sequestered . “ The root exudates have a similar fate , either being used as food by microbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minerals. ” “ This stable organic soil carbon can persist in the soil for decades to centuries , even up to a millennium , depending on the soil , the climate , and the land-use practices , ” they said . Cotrufo and Leuthold said that a multi-faceted approach is required to ensure quality soil . They said that the approach would need to be flexible enough to evolve as technologies , climates and the needs of communities change . “ Preserving natural areas and rewilding low-quality agricultural and industrial land present important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ These are areas that tend to yield poorly when crops are grown , either because they ’ re too hilly , too dry , too rocky , have some inherent nutrient deficiencies , or any combination of these and other productivity factors. ” Cotrufo and Leuthold said that although agricultural crops may yield poorly in such areas , the areas can function very well as a natural ecosystem , rebuilding their soil carbon stocks and providing important benefits to their surroundings . The researchers also noted that in productive cropland , incentivizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to increase the quality of some of the most degraded soils around the world . These agricultural regeneration practices include reduced tillage , cover cropping , crop-livestock integration , and increased crop diversity , which can be accomplished by the use of legumes and perennials . Cotrufo and Leuthold also highlighted that indigenous and smallholder farmers have been applying many of these regeneration practices as well as other creative conservation practices for a long time . The researchers said that an important part of the path toward soil and landscape regeneration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers . They said that such agricultural practices are now being demonstrated by science to increase the amount of carbon that enters soils and decrease the amount that leaves it . This often leads to a net gain in overall soil organic carbon and a host of other benefits , such as crop nutrition and water availability , less erosion , and increased biodiversity . “ Similarly , a more focused approach on livestock management that incorporates an understanding of ecosystem dynamics can revitalize soils. ” They said that it is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional agriculture systems to regenerative and more sustainable systems could have on farmers and ranchers it could leave agricultural producers exposed to outsized risk as they adapt their practices and equipment . “ Constructing policies that help to minimize the overall risk of adoption of these soil-friendly practices can help to ensure soil quality as well , ” they said . “ In short , ensuring prolonged soil quality requires all of us to be intentional in thinking about the land we receive our food and fibre from . “ It requires a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who hold this knowledge and the ones who work in these settings and to support policies and practices that emphasize a renewed focus on soil health. ” Cotrufo and Leuthold said that soils have the potential to protect people ’ s livelihoods from the worst outcomes of the changing climate and environment .

"Old Mitch has another bad moment. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images After a second on-camera “episode” in which Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell seemed unable to answer questions or even speak, it’s obviously time to contemplate the approaching end of the 81-year-old Kentuckian’s long reign as his party’s leader in the upper chamber and consider what will happen next. You don’t have to get all maudlin about McConnell’s supposed representation of bygone Senate traditions (I personally think he’s an amoral pursuer of power for its own sake) to marvel at his longevity at the helm of his party conference. When McConnell became leader in 2007, the party of Ronald Reagan was still in place; it had not yet been shaken by the tea-party movement or shattered by Donald Trump’s triumph over a Republican Establishment of which McConnell was an integral part. Republicans of that era were still fiercely defending George W. Bush’s “forever wars” in Afghanistan and Iraq and (by and large) supporting “amnesty” for many millions of undocumented immigrants."

Below AFP Sport looks at three things we learned from England 's first campaign under their new leadership team of coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes . A year ago , England made absolutely no effort to chase down a target of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand at Lord 's as the match petered out into a tame draw . Yet this series saw them chase down stiff targets of 277 and 299 in five-wicket wins at Lord 's and Trent Bridge before Jonny Bairstow 's blistering fifty made light of their pursuit of 296 in Leeds . `` If we were on the wrong side of results of these games , if they played out the same way but we 'd lost , I would have walked off a very , very happy captain with the way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've given to every single day , every single session , every single hour of these three Tests matches , '' said Stokes . Bairstow has now played 86 Tests for England yet there has often been uncertainty about his position in the side , with the Yorkshireman variously deployed as a top-order batter , middle-order run-getter and wicketkeeper-batsman . But , relieved of the gloves by Ben Foakes and given the freedom to attack by Stokes and McCullum he now appears settled at number five and able to play in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-class white-ball batsman . For evidence look no further than a stunning hundred in a run-chase at Trent Bridge and his first-innings 162 at Headingley -- not to mention his heroics on Monday . In 2022 he has already scored 774 runs in seven Tests with four centuries at an average of 64.50 . `` His role in the white-ball team is very clear , very specific , and he knows exactly what to do every time he steps out to play , '' said Stokes . `` Now he 's playing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( one-day kit ) on . With Jonny it 's just about making sure he knows what he 's in the team to do . '' The late former Australia skipper Richie Benaud was fond of saying cricket captaincy was `` 90 percent luck and 10 percent skill , but do n't try it without the 10 percent '' .

The report points to the Fake News inventive “ facts ” of the gas prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being megaphoned to the American people as being the general environment that was absorbing the Red Waves energy .

Republicans — or at least a significant element of the party — are utterly besotted with Trump, while Democratic officialdom is dutifully lining up behind Biden despite polling showing that the rank-and-file has deep misgivings about him. The Iowa-Iowa State football game last weekend showed Trump at full force. He got his share of boos, but the throng of people who lined up to see him walk along a corridor at the stadium was ecstatic and adoring."
""""""" ALBANY — Polio was discovered in wastewater samples from a Rockland County sewage treatment plant dating back to early June , state officials announced Monday . The wastewater testing began last week , shortly after the county recorded the first case of the life-threatening virus in the U.S. since 2013 . Going back over sewage samples already collected for COVID-19 testing , state officials worked with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the international Global Polio Laboratory Network to determine that the virus found in Rockland is genetically linked to a strain recorded in Jerusalem . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – are ongoing to determine possible spread of the virus and potential risk associated with these various isolates detected from different locations around the world , ” the Global Polio Eradication Initiative said in a statement . Polio is a highly contagious and potentially deadly virus that paralyzed or killed thousands of U.S. children prior to widespread vaccination efforts in the latter half of the 20th century . Areas with lower vaccination rates can see the virus spread quickly because those infected can transmit it even if they aren ’ t sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flulike , can take up to 30 days to appear . [ What is polio , the disease that paralyzed tens of thousands of children before the 1960s ? ] The variant recorded in Rockland as well as Israel is linked to a vaccine used across much of the world , but no longer utilized in the U.S . The oral vaccine uses weakened live viruses that prompt the immune system to create protective antibodies . However , the weakened strains can occasionally spread among the unvaccinated and , often in areas with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean drinking water , genetically revert to a form that can cause paralysis . State officials note that Rockland County currently has a polio vaccination rate of 60.5 % among 2-year-olds compared with the statewide average of 79.1 % . “ Polio is a dangerous disease with potentially devastating consequences , ” state Health Commissioner Mary Bassett said . “ Given how quickly polio can spread , now is the time for every adult , parent and guardian to get themselves and their children vaccinated as soon as possible. ” The vaccine used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active viruses . Rockland was the epicenter of a measles outbreak back in 2018 and 2019 that saw the now rare viral infection spread largely among children in the Orthodox Jewish communities whose parents refused to get them vaccinated . That outbreak led New York lawmakers to put an end to vaccination exemptions based on religious beliefs . """""""
""""""" Prior to 2015 or 2016 , you could still read what you wanted online without much interference . This has since changed , as propagandists have infiltrated the media and , along with other major players , like Big Tech and government , set out to control information . Fact-checking — a once-obscure term that ’ s since gone mainstream — is one part of the campaign to control what you see online , and therefore what you think and how you perceive reality — but it ’ s all a ruse . Speaking with Jan Jekielek , The Epoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show “ American Thought Leaders , ” investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson explains how virtually everything you see and hear online has been co-opted , or taken over to serve a greater agenda:1 The Information Landscape Is Being Controlled Attkisson calls out several common online sources that are heavily manipulated — Wikipedia , Snopes and most “ fact ” checkers to name a few , along with HealthFeedback.org , which is a fake science group used by Facebook and other Big Tech companies to debunk science that is actually true . Fact checkers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , too , is “ part of a very well-funded , well-organized landscape that dictates and slants the information they want us to have. ” While there have always been efforts to shape the information being given out by the media , it used to be that news reporters would push back against organizations to ensure the public had the other side of the story . Beginning in the early 2000s , Attkisson noted a shift from efforts to simply shape information to those that attempt to keep certain information from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true among the pharmaceutical companies she was covering at that time . Attkisson described “ efforts by these large global PR firms that have been hired by the pharmaceutical industry , by government partners that work with the pharmaceutical industry , to keep the story from being reported at all. ” 2 Now , suppressing and censoring information that those in charge don ’ t want to be heard is really common . Attkisson believes the practice really took off in 2015 to 2016 , “ with Donald Trump proving to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans , and by that I mean by the interests that support and pay for them to be in office and make certain decisions. ” 3 With a wild card in office , a campaign was organized that exploited a media that was already conflicted and less apt to report what was actually going on . “ This all dovetailed together to create this crazy information landscape we have today , ” she said . Instead of journalists seeking to uncover the truth , we have “ writers seeking to spread whatever establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uncritically and at the expense , oftentimes , of accuracy. ” Now , instead of real journalists and reporters , the media is infiltrated with propagandists who dictate what ’ s “ fake news ” and what ’ s not . Many believe that fake news is a product of Trump , but Big Tech was brought into the campaign early on . A lobby campaign by behind-the-scenes propagandists met with Facebook and said you ’ ve got to start censoring and “ fact ” checking information , Attkisson said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Trump was elected , but it actually got its start before that — it was an invention of political activist website First Draft News , which is partially funded by Google.4 We ’ re in the midst of an information war where it ’ s difficult to tell truth from fiction or lies . Journalists are no longer the watchdogs ; instead , they take information from obviously conflicted sources and then try to convince the public to believe that particular viewpoint . Other information that ’ s in conflict is censored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unusual time in history where efforts are even underway to manipulate the public to want their information censored and appreciate third-party “ fact ” -checkers , which were introduced as a tool to confuse and manipulate the public further.5 Yet , when you only hear one side of the story , and you can ’ t access other information to the contrary , it ’ s nearly impossible to uncover the truth — and that ’ s precisely the point . Is this all just a matter of reporters not knowing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , or believing that they ’ re doing the right thing ? Attkisson states that it goes much deeper . A lot of propagandists have become part of the media , and while there used to be a firewall between reporters and the people they reported on , “ that ’ s long gone. ” She says:6 In early 2020 , as the pandemic first started brewing , Attkisson talked to everyone she could , including scientists with the government and outside the government . “ Pretty quickly , I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly were bearing out as not true , and certain things that other scientists were telling me privately rang true , and in hindsight have actually been proven to be true. ” 7 Early on , quite a few scientists she talked to were questioning the advice being given by government scientists , including Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and lead spokesperson for the president ’ s COVID response . She asked them if they should say something and speak out about their concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same response:8 Certainly , those scientists ’ opinions deserved to be heard , but the fear of speaking out silenced them . They feared losing their grants , as most grants for research are funded by the government . If the government doesn ’ t like what you say or do , you can get fired or never get a grant again , ending your career and threatening your very livelihood . “ That started to strike me as , this is a really dangerous environment , when esteemed scientists who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them , and instead we ’ re hearing a party line that many of them disagree with but won ’ t say so , ” Attkisson said.9 She mentioned the controversial U.S. government funding of gain-of-function research in China , and the notion that SARS-CoV-2 could have come from a Chinese laboratory — both were glaring issues that no one would talk about . “ These are the kinds of things early on that were sort of a red flag to me that says somebody ’ s trying to shape the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ re using reporters to do it . Public health figures are involved in some instances and that makes me want to know what ’ s really behind it. ” 10 ‘ Conspiracy Theory ’ Was Devised by the CIA The term “ conspiracy theory ” is now used to dismiss narratives that go against the grain . According to Attkisson , this is intentional , as the term itself was devised by the CIA as a response to theories about the assassination of JFK . “ It was shown in documents that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and talk to reporters about these things as conspiracy theories — and again , common sense should tell you , as it does me , I ’ m married to a former law enforcement official who has said to me many times , you know the conspiracy theory phrase in its use doesn ’ t make sense . Nearly everything is a conspiracy. ” 11 Anything that involves two or more people is technically a conspiracy , but now when people hear the term , they ’ re conditioned to think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s designed to pluck this little part of your brain that says , ‘ well that thing ’ s not true. ’ ” When Attkisson hears the term , however , she thinks that information may well be true . “ If somebody ’ s trying to debunk it , it usually means a powerful interest is behind it and it makes me want to go search for more information on that thing. ” The term “ conspiracy theory ” has lost meaning now because it ’ s used so much . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ antivaccine ” are all terms that are similarly being used as propaganda tools . “ There ’ s a whole cast of propaganda phrases that I ’ ve outlined that are cues . When you hear them , they should make you think , ‘ I need to find out more about it , ’ ” Attkisson says . In another example of the lengths that fact-checkers will go to discredit a story — even if it ’ s true — take an article published in the BMJ , titled , “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data integrity issues in Pfizer ’ s vaccine trial. ” 12 Written by investigative journalist Paul D. Thacker , it details a series of problems with laboratory management and quality control checks by Pfizer subcontractor Ventavia Research Group , which was testing Pfizer ’ s COVID-19 vaccine . According to a regional director formerly employed by Ventavia , she witnessed falsified data , unblinded patients , inadequately trained vaccinators and lack of proper follow-up on adverse events that were reported . After notifying Ventavia about her concerns , repeatedly , she made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration — and was fired the same day.13 Soon after Thacker ’ s investigative piece was published in BMJ , it was “ fact checked ” by a group called Lead Stories , which referred to the investigation as a “ hoax alert ” in the related URL . Along with “ correcting ” statements that Thacker did not make , Lead Stories disparaged the investigation for “ missing context , ” but as investigative reporter Matt Taibbi explained , “ ‘ Missing context ’ has become a term to disparage reporting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stories took further issue with the BMJ investigation because it was shared by people such as Dr. Robert Malone and Robert F. Kennedy , who themselves have been targeted by fake fact checkers . Taibbi added:15 Thacker also called the “ fact check ” against his BMJ investigation “ insane , ” telling Taibbi:16 Reality Is Being Altered in Real Time As it stands , information is being changed in real time to meet the common agenda . This includes definitions in dictionaries and on official government websites . Examples of definitions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic , herd immunity , vaccines and anti-vaxxer . Attkisson reiterates:17 For now , you can still use the Internet Archive , commonly known as Archive.org and IA , as a historical archive . In addition to digitally hosting more than 1.4 million books and other documents , Archive.org acts as a historical vault for the Internet , preserving cached versions of websites that are no longer accessible to the public.18 Archive.org ’ s Wayback machine preserves digital information that has been removed or deleted , whether intentionally or for other reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day disappear . Attkisson says:19 Attkisson is maintaining a running list of things the media or public policy got wrong during the pandemic , which can still be verified using the Wayback machine , but which were not acknowledged for being wrong or corrected by the press . They include:20 You Can Be Controlled if You Live Inside the Box Attkisson references a whole generation of people who live inside the box , meaning the internet . Those who rely solely on the internet for their information are at serious risk of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is that the internet paints a picture that ’ s different from reality . You may read something that doesn ’ t sound quite right , or that you don ’ t agree with , but the internet makes you feel like you ’ re in the minority — even if you ’ re really not . “ Understand that you may actually be in the majority , ” Attkisson says , “ … but the goal of what they do online is to make you think you ’ re an outlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you afraid to talk about your viewpoint or what you think , because you may actually be the majority opinion but they want to control that and make you think you ’ re the one who ’ s crazy. ” The solution ? Live outside the box:23 The Truth Finds a Way To Be Told While there are powerful forces at play to control information , all is not lost . Attkisson is aware of three entities that are actively working on a solution , which include : • Investors who want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technical people trying to invent platforms that can ’ t be controlled and deplatformed by Big Tech • Journalists who want to work or contribute to these efforts Outlets like Substack newsletters and the video platforms Rumble , Bitchute and Odysee , which don ’ t censor videos for ideological reasons , are actively getting around the censorship of Big Tech , and Attkisson believes that these efforts will accelerate in the next couple of years . Further , she says , “ The propagandists may have overplayed their hand by being so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information and the censorship . It ’ s no longer deniable . Even people who want their information curated , they can ’ t always be happy with the notion that they ’ re not going to be able to get the full story , or that they ’ re only getting one side of something. ” 24 Ultimately , she adds , “ I think the truth finds a way to be told … it may take some time and there may be a lot of people that don ’ t want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as humans seek it. ” 25 On a personal level , you can go a long way toward finding the truth by following your own common sense and reason , and Attkisson agrees . “ I always say , do your own research , make up your own mind , think for yourself . Trust your cognitive dissonance , use your common sense . You ’ re going to be right more often than you think , but open up your mind , read a lot , think a lot and don ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face value. ” 26 The Best of Joseph Mercola """""""

"Assembly lawmakers passed a package of six bills on Thursday that Republicans argue will address the growing child care crisis by expanding resources and providing flexibility to child care providers. Child care providers have criticized the bills and none of them received support from Democrats, who said the bills were misguided and wouldn’t solve the problems facing the industry. The passage of the bills comes ahead of a special session Gov. Tony Evers called for next week, asking lawmakers to consider workforce proposals, including an additional $365 million of new funding for Child Care Counts. The first bill, AB 387, would allow parents or other legal guardians to contribute up to $10,000 a year before taxes to a child care reimbursement account. The bill passed 62-35, along party lines. “This bill is out there to provide a solution for people that are looking for child care options. Once again, it’s just a tool. Doesn’t fix it all,” Rep. Clint Moses (R-Menomonie) said. “This is a fairly low-cost fix or low-cost solution which is hugely important. The answer is not always throwing more money at it. Throwing more money at it gets you more inflation.”"

""""""" Admittedly this post isn ’ t going to be for everyone but if you ’ re old enough to remember a time when there were arcades all around the country and video games in every 7-11 and drug store , then you might find the story of this urban legend interesting . Long ago in some dark arcade there appeared a solitary video game in a non-descript black cabinet . It was called Polybius and it wasn ’ t just the latest game from the normal manufactuerers attempting to drain quarters from players . Polybius was a real-world experiment built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They tested it ’ s impact on unsuspecting teens and the game was allegedly so addictive that people who played it had serious side effects . Polybius wasn ’ t just a game , it was a game that could control your mind . And then , not long after it appeared , the men in black took it away and it was never seen again . Right now it ’ s sitting in a crate inside a massive government warehouse between the wreckage from the Roswell incident and the Lost Ark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not really but the legend persists , especially among the relatively small number of weirdos who still care about 80s arcade games . If there ’ s a Barcade in your town , the owner has almost certainly heard the legend of Polybius . Today the BBC released a video today about this legend . According to their version of the story , the legend first arose in Portland , Oregon based on an arcade in a specific mall . There ’ s a lot of hand-waving at this point to suggest some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true . I have to say that I don ’ t find this version of events very convincing . First of all , Cat DeSpira , the woman who claims that Polybius ( or some elements of the story ) happened in Portland , only heard the story years later . And in a blog post about the BBC clip , she admits it ’ s ultimately just a myth : “ The game never existed . It ’ s a hoax. ” As for Kevin Mannis , who claims in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polybius myth , I ’ m not convinced of that either . Mannis did create a similar story called the The Dybbuk Box which had some similar elements , i.e . a box haunted by a malicious spirit . That story eventually became the basis of a 2012 horror movie called The Possession . Did Mannis help spread the Polybius myth ? Maybe , but it ’ s also possible that it has been around for a long time and he simply came across it like everyone else . The best evidence suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000s though it may have been circulating by word of mouth before then . My own theory , and that ’ s all it is , is that the story of Polybius may have started with a real game that was actually built in the early 1980s by Atari . It was called Bradley Trainer and it was a heavily revised version of the arcade game Battlezone . But Bradley Trainer was commissioned by the Army which wanted to see if video games could be used to actually train people in the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on the game was controversial among the team that worked on it . Some of them didn ’ t like the idea that Atari was essentially working for the Army , albeit indirectly . Eventually only a few prototype games were produced and the Army decided it wasn ’ t interested . Like Polybius , Bradley Trainer disappeared and was largely forgotten . Two copies of the machine were allegedly built and some claim that both survive to this day . I believe the real number that still exists is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most valuable single arcade game in existence . I know the current owner and he ’ s told me the incredible amount of money he has been offered and turned down by people wanting to buy it . Bradley Trainer never was placed in an arcade and it never controlled anyone ’ s mind but the connection between video games and the Army is one that may have been in the mind of whoever first launched the myth of Polybius .

"Former members of the Farc guerrilla army in Colombia who laid down their arms as part of a peace deal in 2016 are being forced off the land they were allowed to settle after they demobilised. More than 200 families of the Mariana Páez community, about eight hours south of the capital Bogotá in Colombia’s Meta department, have had to flee the hamlet they have lived in following demobilisation due to threats from dissident former Farc fighters who have refused to accept the treaty. Another group of about 360 people have reportedly also been forced off their land at Vista Hermosa, in the same region of Colombia, after the assassinations of two former Farc guerrillas, both signatories to the peace deal, and subsequent death threats."
""""""" Goldman , which like Morgan Stanley and unlike Nomura and Deutsche Bank , refuses to make a recession its base case ( but is quick to make it very clear that in case of recession the S & P will drop to 3,150 ) , has looked back at all the 77 recessions across the globe since 1961 to provide context around the current economic environment in a report titled `` Revisiting Recession Facts '' ( available to pro subs ) . The report 's bottom-line according to Goldman 's Chris Hussey : some of what we are seeing today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates -- suggests that the world could be on the brink of a rather severe recession . '' That said , the bank highlights several other aspects of the current environment which provide a buffer against a notable turndown in activity . And for once we agree with Goldman , according to which the key thing to watch is the `` fiscal and monetary response to a downturn . '' And since Democrats will lose Congress this November and there will be no new fiscal stimulus until 2025 at the earliest , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch is the monetary response , i.e. , when the Fed will i ) cut rates back to zero , ii ) resume QE and/or iii ) cut rates negative . Before we dig into the Goldman report , which looks at key facts about the frequency and severity of recessions analyzing 77 recessions in advanced economies since 1961 , here are the main findings : • According to Goldman , the odds that the economy enters a recession in the next year at 30 % in the US , 40 % in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the UK . • Goldman 's subjective recession probabilities are significantly higher than the average 15 % annual unconditional probability of advanced economies to enter a recession since the 1960s . • The unemployment rate has risen by 2.7 % in the median advanced economy recession since the 60s with larger increases in the 1980s and the UK but smaller increases in Japan . The distribution is slightly skewed towards larger increases in more severe recessions . • Economic overheating—high unit labor cost growth and high core inflation—and large cumulative increases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In contrast , elevated private sector financial surpluses often foreshadow less severe recessions . • Currently , across the advanced economies , unit labor cost growth , core inflation , and the expected total increase in the policy rate are generally running at levels similar to the runup of the typical advanced economy recession . Higher measures of economic overheating in the US , UK , and Canada than in Japan and the Euro area suggest that the next recession may be somewhat less shallow in these English-speaking G10 economies . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been much higher than ahead of the typical recession for all economies , hinting at a shallow next recession . • Other factors outside the historical dataset paint a mixed picture . On the pessimistic side , the monetary and fiscal policy response might be more limited than usual and energy disruptions are the main risk in Europe . On the optimistic side , long run inflation and wage expectations still appear mostly anchored and substantial supply side improvement opportunities remain . With that in mind , let 's delve deeper into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historical frequency of recessions using official recession classifications , such as the NBER in the US , when available . Exhibit 1 shows that the annual unconditional probability of advanced economies to enter a recession since the 1960s has been roughly 15 % on average . It also shows that recession risk has not varied much across countries or over time over the past several decades . Goldman 's subjective recession probability in the US of 30 % over the next year is also elevated relative to its own extended history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US has averaged 12 % since the 90 ’ s ( Exhibit 2 ) , though it averaged a much higher 23 % between 1855-1990 . US recessions have become less frequent following the creation of the Federal Reserve , the anchoring of inflation expectations , and the decline in the relative importance of the cyclical manufacturing sector . Goldman then defines the severity of recessions using the trough to peak change in the unemployment rate . The list excludes the “ exogenous ” pandemic recession of 2020 as increases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in countries such as the US and Canada or significantly limited by furlough schemes in Europe and Japan . Exhibit 3 shows that the unemployment rate has risen by 2.7 % in the median advanced economy recession since the 60s , with somewhat larger increases in the 1980s ( Exhibit 3 , left ) . Countries with larger increases in the unemployment rate also tend to have less frequent recessions—including the UK , Netherlands , and Sweden . In contrast , countries with smaller increases in the unemployment rate tend to have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , and Japan . The distribution of the change in the unemployment rate during recessions shows a slight skew towards more severe recessions . The distributions in the UK and Canada are especially skewed towards more severe recessions , while the distribution in Japan is skewed towards less severe recessions . Goldman next summarizes the predictors of recession severity focusing on variables that have a long history : it finds that economic overheating—unit labor cost growth and high core inflation ( Exhibit 5 ) —and large cumulative increases in the policy rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , large private sector financial surpluses often foreshadow less severe recessions . What do these findings imply for the size of the next recession ? Across advanced economies , unit labor cost growth , core inflation , and the expected total increase in the policy rate are generally running at levels similar to the runup of the typical advanced economy recession , with more overheating in the US , UK , and Canada and less in Japan and the Euro area . In contrast , the private sector financial balance has been much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across advanced economies . Taken together , Exhibits 6 and 7 paint a mixed picture about the size of the next recession in the English-speaking G10 economies . According to Goldman , on the pessimistic side , elevated economic overheating measures point to a higher than usual right tail risk of severe recession . On the optimistic side , the bank 's strategists suggest that the large private sector surplus points to a shallow recession ; what they ignore is the adverse effect of tens of trillions in lost equity value , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` savings '' by modern economists too . So while there may be $ 2 trillion more in excess savings , there is $ 20 trillion less in stock market equity . Which is worse ? Turning to other factors outside of Goldman 's historical dataset , we again see a mixed picture . On the pessimistic side , the monetary and fiscal policy response might be more limited than usual because policy rates remain close to their effective lower bound while both central bank balance sheets and government debt levels are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exposure to the war in Ukraine and the risk of energy supply shortages paint a relatively negative view for Germany and Italy , especially with the possibility of gas shutdowns in the winter . On the more optimistic side , long run inflation and wage expectations still appear mostly anchored , although as even Powell will admit , that is changing fast . Moreover , substantial supply side improvement opportunities remain in both global supply chains—where delivery times have shortened—and in the labor market . What is more relevant however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report titled Timing the cuts , `` Investors seem to be shifting focus from pricing a potential recession , to pricing future Fed cuts ... for as early as 2023 . '' Indeed , as we have been pounding the table since early this year , the timing of those cuts is all that matters . """""""

The result sees the Orange and Blue (17-4-7, 58 points) continue to pace the Eastern Conference and Supporters’ Shield standings while the Union (14-8-5, 47 points) remain fourth in the east, as other league results stand. Jose Martinéz scored his third goal of the season in the 23rd minute to give the hosts a 1-0 lead. Martinéz struck well from distance near the top of the Cincinnati box and was able to beat a diving Roman Celentano. Jack McGlynn, who assisted on three goals in 2022, picked up his second assist of the season. The Union were able to double their lead from the penalty spot in the 37th minute after Daniel Gazdag was fouled by Celentano inside the box. Gazdag broke in behind the Cincinnati defense and threatened goal, and he was tripped up by the FC Cincinnati keeper. Gazdag would step to the spot and convert with a perfectly placed penalty for his 12th goal of the season."

As those remaining Labour MPs and the party loyalists look up to a retreated red wave vanishing on the horizon, it would pay to remember they’re not the first to be left standing there. Two recent texts – one a book, the other a podcast – are set on the windswept, rocky, bloodied shores left exposed by outgoing electoral tides. Both tell ripping yarns, of envy and scheming, of backbiting and bloodshed. And both should be compulsory stocking fillers for Labour MPs this Christmas."

But there’s no time for the party faithful to rest and recuperate, with conference attendees straight back out on the doorsteps as polling day in Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth draws ever closer. Delivering the final speech of this year’s gathering, Jonathan Ashworth issued a call to arms, not just to party members and supporters, but “to all who yearn for change, to those who voted Conservative in the past but can see today how far this Conservative Party has moved away from you, to those who love this country and know it can be so much better. Join us on this journey to a brighter day.” Labour debuted a powerful new campaign video on the final day of conference, setting out how the party’s five missions will “improve the lives of working people”. Conference was a rather more quiet affair than some others in recent years and went largely to plan for the party leadership (aside from Keir Starmer’s glitter-bombing during the leader’s speech, although some may argue that worked in his favour). Controversial rule changes put forward by the party’s ruling national executive committee were passed by delegates, and the final document from the party’s National Policy Forum also got conference’s stamp of approval."

"The idea that European countries can be divided into those of the chaotic and unstable South, and the ‘stable’ and ‘efficient’ North, is officially finished. After Britain and Germany, the time has now come for the Netherlands to drop the label, “a boring place where nothing never happens”. In the past months, almost all the party leaders across the political spectrum have resigned. And in the coming elections, 70 political parties have so far registered possible candidates! Chaos and fragmentation loom. In the country where the capitalist system was essentially born, the ruling class is proving utterly feeble and devoid of perspective. As students and workers are being made to pay for a crisis created by this ruling class, it ought to come as no surprise that 75 percent of Dutch people do not trust parliament, and even more (79 percent) do not trust politicians. These politicians and the system they represent are precisely the ones responsible for our problems!"

"European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen is concentrating ever-more power in her own hands — and it’s happening in parallel with the European Union’s drift to the right. Taking on unlimited powers has always been a temptation for European right-wing leaders. A full decade ago, Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán began to theorize “illiberal democracy.” He was followed in 2019 by Matteo Salvini, leader of the hard-right Lega, who demanded “full powers” to change Italy. But when it comes to the president of the European Commission, this tendency looks particularly disastrous, at a time when the future of the EU is hanging in the balance. The bloc’s democratic deficit has not been solved; rather, it is today aggravated by alleged breaches of the rule of law, both in member states and at the EU level itself. Not only the EU’s democratic standing is today at issue, but also its social vocation, in a time when tens of millions are hit by the rising cost of living. In such a context, Von der Leyen’s actions represent both the result of the EU’s neoliberal turn — and the premise of its further illiberalization. The State of the Union “In just under three hundred days, Europeans will take to the polls in our unique and remarkable democracy.” It was with these words of praise for the EU’s democratic vigor that Von der Leyen started her “State of the Union 2023” speech on September 13. In the United States, the “State of the Union” tradition was begun by George Washington in 1790, and since the invention of mass media has at least supposedly represented a unifying moment. In 2010 the EU also introduced the idea of an annual speech by the European Commission president. Supposed to announce the legislative agenda — and allow the president to be held accountable — this speech is also about this leader’s political capital. With her term almost over, Von der Leyen is clearly eyeing a second spell in office. That is why she effectively turned this State of the Union into a campaign speech for next June’s EU election, as was clear from the first lines cited above. But also evident is a right-wing drift: the more proper term would be the “Melonization” of Von der Leyen. The president, who led various German ministries under Chancellor Angela Merkel, belongs to the European People’s Party (EPP), whose leader is Manfred Weber. Two years ago, the EPP intensified its talks with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), led by Italy’s far-right Giorgia Meloni. This dialogue resulted in a tactical alliance that is today developing apace. Already before Meloni, leader of the postfascist Fratelli d’Italia party, became Italian prime minister last October, she had boycotted attempts to form a Europe-wide far-right alliance, as proposed by Matteo Salvini, Viktor Orbán, and Marine Le Pen. In return for this role of saboteur, Meloni could become an interlocutor of the ruling right-wing force in the EU, namely the EPP. Without Weber’s normalization of the Italian postfascist leader, it would have been more difficult for her to govern. But this is exactly what she has secured. In January 2022, the election of the EPP’s Roberta Metsola as the president of the European Parliament was the first test of this alliance itself; the ECR group, which also includes Spain’s Vox and Poland’s Law and Justice, got a vice president. Most importantly, it secured the breaking of the previous cordon sanitaire against the far right. Then came the elections in Sweden and in Finland, whose new prime ministers both belong to the EPP and are both governing with support of far-right parties. EPP chief Weber opened the door to these kinds of deals: postfascists and post-Nazis are no more a taboo for the EPP when it comes to governmental alliances. The “Melonization” of Ursula von der Leyen Despite the political infighting between them, Manfred Weber and Ursula von der Leyen have come to terms. While the European Commission president thinks about her second term, her current one is making a clear shift to the right. Von der Leyen is well known for her centralizing methods: sometimes even her EU commissioners get shut out of decision-making. During the pandemic, Von der Leyen’s ambition for “full powers” came to light when the New York Times wrote about her negotiating with Pfizer about vaccines “with texts and calls.” Already months beforehand, members of the European Parliament had denounced the European Commission’s lack of transparency, as symbolized by the “dark room” where only a few of them, for a few minutes, could take a look at heavily redacted contracts. After “SMS-gate” exploded, the European Ombudsman concluded that “the Commission should have searched for the documents requested, including those not registered. The Commission’s failure to do so is maladministration.” The European Public Prosecutor’s Office is investigating the case, and the office’s head denounced the European Commission’s “lack of information”. The tactical alliance with Meloni is exacerbating Von der Leyen’s attitude. The president of the European Commission showed her support to Italy’s prime minister on several occasions: when Meloni invites her, Von der Leyen follows. She went to Emilia-Romagna after the flooding in the northern Italian region, and then to the island of Lampedusa when Meloni spoke of Italy shouldering a migration crisis. But the pair’s trips to the Tunisian capital this summer were the most interesting, in terms of the EU’s lack of democratic legitimacy. Von der Leyen gave Meloni a stage for her propaganda — and a chance to promote the idea of an agreement with Tunisia’s authoritarian president Kais Saied to manage migration, stopping people crossing the Mediterranean. While Saied is an exponent of “great replacement” theory and has destroyed democracy in his country, the European Commission rapidly signed the memorandum with Tunisia. Sophie in’t Veld, a liberal member of the European Parliament and a strong defender of the rule of law, immediately pointed out that the memorandum had the legal status of “a beer coaster.” In’t Veld asks, “Why were Mark Rutte and Giorgia Meloni with the EU Commission, when the memorandum was signed? What’s the legal status of this so-called ‘Team Europe’ delegation? This is a fantasy body!” Von der Leyen “is more and more ignoring checks and balances; she is blurring the separation of powers. The final effect is the lack of a democratic control: Who should we hold accountable for this memorandum?” The inconsistency of the EU-Tunisia agreement was evident in September: High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell reported that “several member states expressed their incomprehension regarding the commission’s unilateral action.” Despite Borrell’s letter, dated September 7, a week later Von der Leyen claimed in her State of the Union address that “we have signed a partnership with Tunisia . . . and we now want to work on similar agreements with other countries.”"

On the other hand , many who have received the injections report no adverse effects and deem the data points above a “ crazy conspiracy ” . The question from the uninjured seems to be – why don ’ t we see MORE deaths if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ? Setting aside ethical limitations of this question , here is a possible answer why : The mRNA shots do not conform to their label specifications . In practice both “ blank ” and “ lethal ” vials and anything in between is produced . Without full compliance , nobody , not even the manufacturers or regulators , know exactly what ends up being produced . Vials of mRNA injections are not routinely tested by the manufacturers for conformity to the label . The only vial-level tests specified by Pfizer in leaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents are the vial weight at filling , manual inspection for large visible particles , and some tests related to integrity such as vial capping . However , no vial or dose , i.e. , “ unit-level as dispensed , ” tests verifying the ingredients are described as routine . How is the public assured that each Pfizer dose contains 30 mcg of mRNA as stated on the label ? What level of variability of this key ingredient and other ingredients is acceptable ? The ingredient conformity tests described in Pfizer CMC package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing – an upstream manufacturing process step . It is a regulatory requirement to retain samples of each batch produced , and these samples of vials should exist and be available for examination . Per contracts with the US Government , the product is shipped to the DOD who retains the ownership of the vials until the product is injected into people . These contracts are very detailed and specify manufacturing data to be delivered to the DOD . However , I did not find any descriptions of sampling of the vials for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the label . Furthermore , it is expressly forbidden by the international vaccine supply contracts to perform the vial tests for label conformity . Despite the disturbing prohibition of the independent vial testing , covert random testing of the mRNA vials has been ongoing worldwide . Reported thousands of vials have been obtained and tested by dozens of research groups working independently of each other . The quality of these studies varies and depends on the conditions of the samples acquired , access to the lab equipment and the experience of the investigators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all is that there is yet a single vial to be found in full conformity to the manufacturer ’ s label . A review of these independent testing efforts has been published recently . Another high-quality report summarizes experiences testing vials from various manufacturers in Germany .

Some vials contain RNA as well as high concentrations of DNA and protein impurities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the manufacturer . When RNA was sequenced , the sequences did not fully match the specified BNT162b2 sequence , and a large quantity of RNA fragments was found .

Nevertheless , I was able to confirm that the apparent “ blank ” vials from at least one researcher came from batches of Pfizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events reports in VAERS : two batch numbers had 1 report each and one batch number had no reports . This should be contrasted with some batch numbers of Pfizer and Moderna associated with 5,000+ adverse event reports in VAERS , and an average of ~1500 adverse event reports including ~700 serious reports and deaths across all CDC verified batch numbers . Almost all vials examined contain high contamination levels of various metals that are toxic to human body . This finding is consistent across all groups and methodologies , and therefore should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no explanation of the origin or purpose of these materials according to the known manufacturing processes . Additional findings include various forms of carbon , including , potentially graphene oxide , which is a known toxin . Finally , almost all vials examined contain a variety of nano- and micro-particulate contaminants – another conclusive finding with plenty of photo and video documentation . These appear under microscope examinations as shapes and structures of various sizes and include characteristic ribbons , fibers , and crystals . Several published reports by qualified and credentialed microscopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt on the microscope slides . Sometimes a process of movement and what can be described as “ self-assembly ” is visible and has been documented in a single-take video . The researchers also take steps to maintain the chain of custody , examine unexpired product and keep the vials frozen per manufacturer ’ s instructions . Below are some representative images from various manufacturers ’ injection vials from many studies : The images above are startling and remain unexplained to date . Some scientists insist these are all “ salt and cholesterol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks ! I disagree . Images of salt and cholesterol under microscope may match some of these structures , but by far do not explain all of them , and seem especially poor explanations for assembly-disassembly processes that have been observed and video recorded . Sizes of these structures alone are problematic . Dismissing them as “ manufacturing junk ” is not a great way to instill confidence in anyone . These contaminants and bizarre objects are not rare , in fact as the last image shows , at least some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many speculations can be made , one overwhelming conclusion from all the vial tests by independent investigations is that the products are extremely “ dirty ” , do not conform to their labels and should thus be deemed adulterated . This is a clear indicator that the manufacture of these products is not compliant with the current Good Manufacturing Practices ( cGMP ) . Sloppy manufacturing process may result from numerous factors , including lack of accountability , negligence , incompetence and possibly fraud . Review of the contracts with the manufacturers made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARDA and HHS shows that the main driver was the gigantic sums of money made available with no real accountability for quality or safety – all resulting from the forced extreme speed ( “ warp speed ” ) of the scale-up of manufacturing . The U.S. DOD contracted Pfizer in May of 2020 for production of at least 100 million doses by October 31 , 2020 , and up to 500 million doses later . Pfizer ’ s initial contract award was for $ 10 billion , with many additional incentives for delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made with numerous other “ vaccine ” manufacturers , and hundreds of other suppliers , all under the guise of panic buying for covid countermeasures . No real accountability for product quality or consistency or safety was built into those contracts ; in fact , the manufacturers were explicitly exempt from all possible liability under the PREP Act , which is specified in a separate contract clause . The purchaser is the DOD , the distributor is the DOD ( and not the licensed and accountable pharmaceutical distributors ) , and furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to both adulteration and falsification or mislabeling . To meet the contract obligations , Pfizer ’ s manufacturing batch size has increased from microgram scale for lab and animal study volumes to commercial batches of ~140 liters at the end of 2020 and ~300 liters by late 2021 . In my experience , commercializing biotechnologies from academia , failure to scale is one of the leading causes of failures of all new technology ventures . Showering this problem with money rarely accelerates the solution , and very often accelerates the demise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . For example , placing an order today for 1,000,000 of a new type of vehicles with Ford Motor Company to be delivered in 6 months will likely fail no matter the dollars spent , since even obtaining the raw materials in time will be problematic . Complex manufacturing requires materials , systems , capacity , experienced staff , established processes , suppliers , and most importantly control systems at the correct scale to be successful and produce high quality consistent product . Now imagine simultaneously asking several direct competitors – Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new cars each in the next 6 months . Based on review of available literature on mRNA manufacturing and my discussions with experts who have made mRNA in the lab , it is not clear that mRNA can be manufactured at the scale that is estimated for these injections from known shipment numbers and disclosed manufacturing documentation : 200-300 liters of drug product per average batch , 700+ batches a year in the US alone . This is particularly unlikely if strict cGMP rules are applied to the manufacturing requirements , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of these injections . Recently , FDA found Catalent non-cGMP compliant . Catalent handles large volumes of fill-finish for Moderna , therefore batches processed through Catalent are non-cGMP compliant . The generation of mRNA by in-vitro transcription ( IVT ) at large scale and under current good manufacturing practice conditions is challenging . For example , the specialized components of the in-vitro transcription IVT reaction must be acquired from certified suppliers that guarantee that all the material is animal component-free and GMP-grade . Furthermore , the availability of large amounts of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . This is true , for example , in the case of the enzymes used for translation and capping . Even the glass vials themselves were reported as a shortage . Additionally , the low yields and batch failure are a known problem . Conceptual process flow of making mRNA drug substance contains several steps : The process is composed of a 2-step enzymatic reaction in continuous form , followed by enzyme recycling using tangential flow filtration strategies and two multimodal chromatography steps , one in bind-elute mode for the intermediate purification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for polishing . Formulation is achieved using a third tangential flow filtration module . This means the mRNA needs to be made by chemical reaction , and then purified , and then capped and purified again . There are many variations of this process , and no standards exist . At the “ formulation ” step ( last box in the picture ) , there are further multiple steps to create lipid nanoparticles , and get the mRNA encapsulated . Further , there are fill and finish steps that likewise are not problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , transportation and manual dose preparation add an extra variability layer . Here is a simple heuristic to understand any manufacturing process flow and not get confused by the jargon : each arrow in the flowchart points to places where errors accumulate Each output-input point in a complex manufacturing flow is where the errors can be checked for and rectified or , if unsolved , will amplify and destroy the product quality and consistency . This is especially dangerous at the extreme speed and scale . In science papers , mRNA manufacturing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works beautifully regardless of whether it is microgram or kilogram output , and not a single paper on this topic dwells much on low yields or process failures . This is because academia never has to confront reality . However , the pesky reality of manufacturing mRNA ( or anything else ) at large scale is highly error prone . Each step has a yield of anywhere between 50 % and 80 % , and sometimes the whole batch fails , and that is especially true at the large scale of production . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % , the caps and tails fall off , mRNA breaks into fragments , lipid nanoparticles do not form perfectly and PEGylation can be inhomogeneous leading to their breakage and subsequent escape and breakage of mRNA . Large mRNA breaks into smaller fragments , and these remain in the substance . At large scale of reaction , the enzymatic process for making mRNA was reported seizing at 37.5 liters of mRNA substance ( before encapsulation into LNP and making drug product ) according to the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) documents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved and transitioned to 100 ’ s of liters scale in a matter of few months , and for all suppliers . mRNA fragments were deemed process related impurities by the EMA who raised a significant concern , but they were dismissed by the FDA as a “ theoretical problem ” – as leaked emails from EMA have shown . mRNA “ fragments ” may or may not code for proteins ; however , micro-RNAs ( miRNA ) can interfere with endogenous cellular processes to detrimental health effects which is described in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on biological weapons published by the NIH in 2018 . Chapter 6 of the book describes gene therapy as a class of biological weapons . Coincidentally , the DOD-pharma contracts for covid-19 shots also explicitly state that the product is being developed for both civilian and military applications . Returning to mRNA manufacturing , multiplying even an optimistic 80 % yield by , for example , 7 process steps results in 20 % final yield , and if the in-process failures are larger , final yield is single digit percentage or a failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of impurities , which are never fully removed as aggressive purification will break the fragile product . Furthermore , the mRNA substance is never equally distributed in the batch volume as thorough mixing of the product is not possible due to its fragility , and lipids tend to float to the top of the vat as well as stick and congregate together . Dangerous possibly cytotoxic aggregates of broken LNPs and mRNA ( mRNA adducts ) can result and were reported by Moderna a full year after large scale deployment of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger the volume of the batch , the more inhomogeneity at the vial level . These conditions can create over-concentrated , toxic vials and the ones that could be “ blanks ” , or anything in between . The larger the batch volume , the more duds it will produce , which in case of this product is largely good news for the injectees . Avoidance of specifying any product conformity tests at the vial level by the manufacturers seems to be intentional in this context . Data from Pfizer ’ s own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of November 2020 shows “ failure to scale ” beginning at approximately 25 % of the current commercial scale of the batch ( current scale = 600,000 vials = 3-4 million doses per batch ) . The graphs below were generated using exact sizes in vials and doses for each Pfizer batch manufactured between August and November 2020 ( Figure 1 ) and all Pfizer shipped doses in the US up to end of April 2022 ( Figure 2 ) . I used reported deaths and adverse events in VAERS database associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batch variability . This does not address vial variability but provides directional information , especially for the scale of manufacturing . The batches in Figure 1 were the first ones to ship commercially and were likely all used close to 100 % since at that time the demand for these injections was insatiable . As the “ scale-up ” of manufacturing proceeded in 2020 , the batches were manufactured in a variety of sizes from 50,000 and up to 300,000 vials ( ~140 liters of drug product ) . During this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing , for example , transition from the pilot facility at Polymun Scientific to Pfizer ’ s own plants and changing major manufacturing steps to new processes . First , the overall data indicate a statistical trend toward increased number of reported deaths with the increase in the batch size – the more this product is used , the more deaths are reported . This is not news for anyone who has been paying attention to the injection related adverse events and deaths . However , the variability batch-to-batch demonstrated by the vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batches of the same size is already apparent at approximately 150,000 vial batch size ( 25 % of the full commercial scale ) . Batches of the same size are 4-5 times different from each other in the number of reported deaths . The “ failure to scale ” story gets larger at scale , no pun . Recently , the exact sizes of Pfizer lots shipped in the United States became known via a FOIA data release , including all doses with associated lot numbers shipped as of end of April 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the plot of all batches from Pfizer , by their reported size in doses on the x-axis and serious adverse events including deaths reported for those lot numbers on the y-axis . Data from VAERS was downloaded on September 24 , 2022 . This graph includes the “ early ” scale up batches from Figure 1 , as well as what appears smaller shipments possibly for batches that were largely distributed overseas . What is immediately apparent from the data – the staggering inconsistency of the product batch-to-batch , and the rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adverse events with increase in batch size . The latter trend is the opposite of what was observed with the early batches . The product is causing fewer adverse events per dose when there are more doses available . This does not make sense , except if these doses are simply sitting on the shelves . Of note is batch FM0173 ( only 26,700 doses shipped in the US ) that generated the highest rate of serious adverse events ( 3.3/1000 doses ) , upper left dot . The scale of manufacturing strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses translates to approximately 900+ liters of mRNA ! Given the manufacturing steps involved , impurities generated and the amount of raw materials , and the scale of manufacturing equipment and disposables needed , it should be questioned whether this truly was a single production run . Figure 3 is the same data as in Figure 2 , with outlier batches removed for clarity ( includes batch sizes from 100K to 4M doses ) : It is evident that the variability batch-to-batch is highly significant and remains unexplained . It is also strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming larger . The only reasonable explanation to this is that the usage of this product per batch has plummeted . Most of what is produced later in the time period is sitting on the shelves . At the end of the time period in this graph ( end of April 2022 ) , an estimated 100M doses were manufactured but not administered in the United States . At the beginning of this graph , nearly all manufactured doses were administered . That is the only reasonable explanation – and it proves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths reported to VAERS ! Table below lists all batches > 4 million doses , including their date of manufacture and the number of serious adverse events and deaths reported for them in VAERS : The “ mega ” batches are not entirely benign . They are simply a larger lottery pool . The single death reported for batch FL0007 is for an 8-year-old girl who died in Texas from a multi-system organ failure ( VAERS ID 2327226-1 ) – see Figure 4 . While the first batch listed in her report RL0007 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series do not exist for Pfizer ) , it is evident that she received both doses from the same FL0007 batch and passed away 3 months later . Here is my educated guess on what is going on with the batch variability : Pfizer ’ s ( and other manufacturers ’ ) contracts were for delivery of DOSES . Millions of them and fast . Contract scope is simply a “ demonstration of large-scale manufacturing ” and billion-dollar bonuses attached for shipping millions of doses by certain dates . No accountability , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doses on time ! The batches of 5 million+ doses should be questioned in this context . These appear largely benign from the adverse event perspective but , since the demand for these shots has plummeted coinciding with production of mega-batches , it is hard to say what the real driver of “ safety ” is – over-dilution of the product or refusal of the customers to be injected . I hope it is the latter . Here is as close as I can get to answering the question “ why aren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Too many people have died and have been injured by these injections , and plenty more will ultimately have their lives cut short . The manufacturers are making both – lethal shots and highly diluted “ blanks ” – in a sloppy , uncontrolled , unaccountable , and ultimately fraudulent manner . To know the truth , these products must be tested at the vial and dose levels , in a random sampling by independent 3rd party laboratories . In the meantime , the products must be recalled , and a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Baker , oil on panel , 24×18 inches . The scene for this painting is from a pastry shop in Ukraine . """""""

Some of the Afghans in the Humanitarian City arrived in the UAE last summer , soon after the U.S.-aligned government in Kabul collapsed . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter flights overseen by nongovernmental groups . They include Afghans hoping to receive a Special Immigrant Visa because they assisted the U.S. war effort ; families and individuals who believe they could be harmed by the Taliban because of their work , ethnicity , gender or other reasons ; and other evacuees who managed to get on an evacuation flight.­ Unlike more than 70,000 Afghans who were directly evacuated and then quickly resettled by the U.S. last year after some security vetting , those living in the Humanitarian City have been subjected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. officials that does not include a guarantee of U.S. resettlement . U.S. policy is responsible for the disparate processing .

'' But advocates have argued that Afghans at the Humanitarian City have been unjustly treated differently , and even ignored , simply because of the plane they were evacuated on and who oversaw their evacuation .

"The far-right Christian group whose name translates as ‘soldiers of god’, started their LGBTQIA+ fobe rhetoric several years ago and attempt to suppress all LGBTQIA+ events. Some call them ‘the Christian IS’. They focus their attacks not only on LGBTQIA+ persons but also on refugees, womens’ rights campaigners and anyone they believe who ‘sins’. During last week’s attack, they caused destruction and beat people up while chanting slogans such as “This is a devil’s bar”, “Promoting homosexuality is forbidden”, “We have warned you hundreds of times” and ""This is just the beginning”. Right-wing anti-LGBTQIA+ policies and impunity for LGBTQIA+ phobic violence While the group has been around for several years, physical attacks have been increasing recently. This is partly because they feel supported by the anti-LGBTQIA+ rhetoric and agenda openly held by more and more politicians and religious leaders.

This graphic by Chimdi Nwosu visualizes the 50 largest data breaches since 2004 , along with the sectors most impacted . Data was aggregated from company statements and news reports . A data breach is an incident in which sensitive or confidential information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unauthorized entity . This can occur as a result of malware attacks , payment card fraud , insider leaks , or unintended disclosure . The targeted data is often customer PII ( personally identifiable information ) , employee PII , intellectual property , corporate data or government agency data . Date breaches can be perpetrated by lone hackers , organized cybercrime groups , or even national governments . Stolen information can then be used in other criminal enterprises such as identity theft , credit card fraud , or held for ransom payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2013 when all three billion Yahoo accounts had their information compromised . In that cyberattack , the hackers were able to gather the personal information and passwords of users . While the full extent of the Yahoo data breach is still not fully realized , subsequent cybercrimes across the globe have been linked to the stolen information . Here are the 10 largest data breaches by amount of user records stolen from 2004–2021 . The massive Yahoo hack accounted for roughly 30 % of the 9.9 billion user records stolen from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next most-impacted sectors were Tech and Finance , with 2 billion and 1.6 billion records stolen , respectively . Although these three sectors had the highest totals of user data lost , that doesn ’ t necessarily imply they have weaker security measures . Instead , it can probably be attributed to the sheer number of user records they compile . Not all infamous data breaches are of a large scale . A smaller data breach in 2014 made headlines when Apple ’ s iCloud was hacked and the personal pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internet . Although this highly targeted hack only affected a few hundred people , it highlighted how invasive and damaging data breaches can be to users . The Cost of Data Breaches to Businesses Every year data breaches cost businesses billions of dollars to prevent and contain , while also eroding consumer trust and potentially having an adverse effect on customer retention . A 2021 IBM security report estimated that the average cost per data breach for companies in 2020 was $ 4.2 million , which represents a 10 % increase from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the added security risk associated with having more people working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic . Completely preventing data breaches is essentially impossible , as cybercrime enterprises are often persistent , dynamic , and sophisticated . Nevertheless , businesses can seek out innovative methods to prevent exposure of data and mitigate potential damages . For example , after the iCloud attack in 2014 , Apple began avidly encouraging users to adopt two-factor authentication in an effort to strengthen data security .

""""""" I don ’ t know if lower-court judges should be able to vacate executive agency rules on their sole authority—and then be able to apply those legal rulings to the whole nation . I think the issue is legitimately complicated , and it makes me sit on the fence while staring at quicksand and scorpions on either side . The judiciary is supposed to check the Congress or the Executive Branch when they stray too far from established laws or constitutional principles . But allowing one random , unelected district court judge to void federal policy enacted by the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , antidemocratic , and even corrupt . The issue of whether judges should have this power came up during a heated oral argument at the Supreme Court this week . The case , United States v. Texas , involves an appeal of US District Judge Drew Tipton ’ s decision to “ vacate ” a rule issued by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas . Mayorkas ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) to prioritize detaining undocumented immigrants who “ pose a threat to national security , public safety , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointee for the Southern District of Texas who is basically Stephen Miller with better hair . He vacated Mayorkas ’ s order , saying that the federal government can not pick and choose which immigrants to detain but must detain all immigrants who are out of status . Tipton ’ s order is legally dubious and practically unworkable . Courts have long held that the Executive Branch ( of which the DHS is a part ) retains a level of discretion on whom to prosecute and how . Prosecutors , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of turnstile jumpers ( or do the exact opposite when they ’ re cowards ) . Moreover , even if the DHS wanted to detain every single undocumented immigrant in this country , it couldn ’ t . The DHS and ICE have neither the labor force nor the detention space ( nor the toothbrushes , apparently ) to round up and process every undocumented immigrant , no matter how dearly white nationalists wish they could . The Biden administration ’ s Department of Justice made all of these obvious arguments against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting , though , is another argument the DOJ made—an argument to curb the power of Tipton , and the legion of Trump judges just like him , to muck up the normal procession of laws in the future . When it comes to executive agencies , federal law says that judges can “ set aside ” agency actions that are “ unlawful ” ; it defines as “ unlawful ” actions that are arbitrary and capricious , contrary to a constitutional right or power , or outside the agency ’ s jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges like Tipton have misunderstood the “ set aside ” rule : It argues that judges can discard agency actions that they think are unlawful , but they can ’ t enjoin those agency rules from applying to the rest of the country . It ’ s a radical argument that would severely limit the power of judges to stop the Executive Branch . It ’ s also a problematic argument . While limiting the power of judges like Tipton is a great idea , allowing executive agencies to make rules and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary . The group of people running the DHS and ICE before the Biden administration should be enough of a reminder that things can always get worse . As if to prove just how thorny the implications of the DOJ ’ s argument are , the justices most hostile to the DOJ ’ s position were an unlikely trio that included Chief Justice John Roberts , alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh , and Ketanji Brown Jackson . Roberts essentially mocked US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar as she made her case on behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wow. ” Jackson said there was a “ conceptual problem ” with the DOJ ’ s arguments—mainly that if a judge thinks an agency ’ s rule is unlawful , they can ’ t easily “ disregard ” it without also enjoining it . Kavanaugh adopted a tone that most closely resembled Matt Damon playing him on Saturday Night Live as he argued that federal judges can ’ t simply have been wrong about the extent of their statutory power all these years . It should be noted that all three of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit , and the D.C . Circuit is where most challenges to federal agency rulemaking are heard . Judges on that circuit certainly act like they are the regulators of the regulatory agencies . At one point , Roberts joked that when he was on the D.C . Circuit , he vacated agency actions “ five times before breakfast. ” But this gets to the heart of the problem : While federal agency actions are traditionally reviewed by the D.C . Circuit , the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any judge , anywhere . In this case , Judge Tipton is essentially a roadside judge in Texas who tells defendants what he does or doesn ’ t take kindly to while chomping on a stalk of hay . Tipton is the guy Boss Hogg runs to when he needs someone to rubber-stamp his violations of the Fourth Amendment rights of the Hazzard boys , but in this case the local law enforcement boss is Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton . Paxton and Tipton work hand in glove , with Paxton inventing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration and Tipton saying “ brilliant. ” Giving these two yokels the power to limit the entire federal government whenever they feel like it is very different from putting that power in the hands of the D.C . Circuit that Roberts , Kavanaugh , and Jackson rose to defend . On the other side , Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed very interested and even supportive of DOJ ’ s arguments . But Gorsuch likely has an ulterior motive : He was out front screaming about the vacated orders and nationwide injunctions that landed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president . That ’ s the final wrinkle in this legal dispute . Trump judges are an odious problem for the Biden administration , but lower-court judges ( from both parties ) were some of the only institutionalists that held the line against the excesses of the Trump administration . Obviously , the conservative-controlled Supreme Court is quick to step in and allow Republican policies to go forward while they slow-walk decisions ( like Tipton ’ s ) that go against Democratic administrations . But that ’ s a different problem from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power federal judges hold and whether they should keep it . Having a strong check to stop federal agencies looks very different depending on which party is in control of those federal agencies . The Trump Judges Are Officially Running the Show When I try to remove myself from the partisanship inherent in how these orders play out , the corrupt alliance between Tipton and Paxton , and the old-school institutionalist concerns of Roberts , Kavanaugh , and Jackson , I ’ m still left with a big fat “ I don ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whether district court judges should have the power to do this . “ I want judges to enjoin federal agencies , if the judges are good ” is not an intellectually defensible position , particularly once you accept the fact that Trump judges exist and will continue to wield power for some time . “ I don ’ t want judges to be able to stop federal agencies from making rules ” also seems woefully naive , given not just what Republicans do when they control the executive but also the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limits of their power . All I can say confidently and stridently is : A judiciary is only as good as the people running it , and right now we have some terrible people in charge . Left unchecked , Tipton will pull these juvenile rulings out of thin air , again and again . But left unchecked , another Republican administration will fully weaponize the executive agencies like the DHS and ICE . I ’ ve never been good at games of “ pick your poison. ” If I ever figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ’ ll let everybody know . """""""

"There are currently two clown shows — sorry, but let’s be honest — going on in the Republican Party. One is the intraparty fighting that seems extremely likely to cause a government shutdown a few days from now. The other is the fight over who will come a distant second to Donald Trump in the presidential primaries. There are many strange aspects to both shows. But here’s the one that has long puzzled me: Everyone says that with the rise of MAGA, the G.O.P. has been taken over by populists. So why is the Republican Party’s economic ideology so elitist and antipopulist? Listen to the rhetoric of the people making Kevin McCarthy look like a fool or of the presidential candidates, and it’s full of attacks on elites — but also of promises to cut taxes for the rich and slash government spending that benefits the working class. For example, Nikki Haley — who is making a credible bid to be Trump’s also-ran, given Ron DeSantis’s implosion — is calling for big cuts to Social Security and Medicare."

'America is a place right now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organise the world to fight back against tyrants and dictators around the world . And that 's why they 're doing it right now . ' A steady stream of Republicans tweeted their anger at Biden and warned that the country 's enemies would be watching .

' For days , Tucker Carlson has been setting out the ground for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox News show . He has repeatedly asked why the US should side with Ukraine rather than Putin . But not everyone was in lockstep . House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy , who has been keen to demonstrate his close relationship with Trump , did not mention Biden at all in his comments . 'Vladimir Putin ’ s invasion of Ukraine is reckless and evil , ' he said . 'The United States stands with the people of Ukraine and prays for their safety and resolve . ' Matt Schlapp , who heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative voice , said the issue of Russia and Ukraine would be a key theme of the next four days . He said there were differences between the party coalition has spread .

Republicans are also less to say they 're very or extremely concerned that Russia 's influence around the world poses a direct threat to the US .

She has been accused of cozying up to dictators and spreading Putin 's propaganda by saying an invasion would not have happened if the West had addressed Russia 's concerns about Ukraine joining NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also said Ukraine had not right to exist independently of Russia . Rep Elise Stefanik , who won Cheney 's position as the third most senior Republican in the House because of her backing for Trump , made clear where she stood .

'He sees the weakness and the incompetence and the stupidity of this administration . And as an American I 'm angry about it and I 'm saddened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Laura Ingraham 's Fox News show . 'It 's a very sad thing for the world , for the country , and it 's certainly very sad for a lot of people that are going to be needlessly killed .

'It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really hurt our country but despite the hoax , I had a good relationship and with president XI of China , other than the fact that I was tariff-ing and taxing the hell out of him . ' 'As a young man growing up , I always heard that the worst thing that could happen is drive those two countries together . It really started with Obama and energy .

'He drove them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart - and Biden now it 's a great love fest and that 's a very bad thing and I think you can probably add Iran into it too . ' Earlier in the interview , in which Trump spoke over the phone with Ingraham , Trump bemoaned that this was happening at all . 'This should have never happened . This would not have happened during my administration . In fact , some people are saying why did n't this take place over the last four years ? It did n't for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain that to you someday , but it would n't have taken place and it would n't have taken place right now . It 's a sad thing for the world and the country and a lot of people that will be needlessly killed . ' Trump argued he 'd have used his good relationship with Putin to stop this from happening . 'Well , I know him very well . We had many , many times together . I got along with him fantastically despite the fact I shut down Nord Stream-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stream 2 if it were n't for me . I am the one that shut it down . ' He then went through a story about how he disagreed with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the strategy regarding Nord-Stream 2 . Trump then linked the invasion with the failed pullout from Afghanistan by the Biden administration in 2021 . 'It 's a terrible thing the way it started , I do n't believe he wanted to do this initially , ' Trump said . ' I think he wanted to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worse . He saw the weakness and you know , it really started with the weakness in Afghanistan . The way they pulled out of Afghanistan . I really believe that 's where he started thinking he could do this .

"Justice Janet Protasiewicz. Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: AP Images When Wisconsin Republicans won total control of state government in 2010, they didn’t just pass right-wing policies; they cemented their majorities with a gerrymander so extreme that Democrats in the archetypal purple state were effectively shut out of legislative power permanently. Over the years, Democrats loosened the Republican stranglehold and have controlled one branch of government since Tony Evers defeated former governor Scott Walker in 2018. But they could only get so far — until Judge Janet Protasiewicz won a hugely consequential state Supreme Court race earlier this year. With a liberal majority for the first time in 15 years, the court appeared poised to overturn the skewed maps (which had been blessed by the previous conservative majority), as well as clarify the legality of abortion and give the stamp of approval to other liberal priorities. But the GOP won’t surrender its grip on power quietly. Leading state Republicans, including state assembly Speaker Robin Vos, have raised the prospect of impeaching Protasiewicz before she has even heard a case, citing what they claim were improper comments regarding the propriety of the maps during her campaign, as well as donations she received from the Democratic Party. Vos has vacillated on actually going forward with the idea, but last week he announced a secret panel of former state Supreme Court justices, which will study the legal basis of impeachment. The assembly also passed a bill that would empower a supposedly nonpartisan redistricting board to draw new maps, a proposal Democratic governor Evers says he will veto. To understand the latest political drama unfolding in Wisconsin, I spoke with Ben Wikler, the state’s Democratic Party chairman. Since taking the role in 2019, Wikler has become a rare celebrity state-party official — a reflection both of his media-centric strategy and of Wisconsin’s paramount importance to Democrats in national elections."
"I tuned in to the first Republican debate to see how the eight candidates on stage would handle the elephant in the room: Donald Trump. The moderators didn’t even raise the issue of the former president for the first half hour, so I got tired of the preening and sound biting and interrupting and turned it off. I later learned about the most salient feature of the entire debate: Six of the eight people on stage said that if they were elected president, they would pardon Donald Trump if he were to be convicted of a felony. Members of the Trump-friendly studio audience whooped their approval. Yahoo! Give the crook a break. That is a sad commentary on today’s Republican Party. The party of law and order has become the party of lies and disorder. The people who purport to defend the Constitution have become unapologetic defenders of an unrepentant conman who thumbs his nose at the Constitution and any other judicial restraint. The party that once valued people of principle like Dwight Eisenhower, Howard Baker, John McCain and Olympia Snowe now give their allegiance to a charlatan like Donald Trump and his loyal band of sycophants, such as Kevin McCarthy, Lindsay Graham, Ted Cruz, Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert. Rush Limbaugh, to whom Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, would be smirking from his grave. Bret Stephens, a conservative journalist and editor, summed it up nicely when he wrote, “Ron DeSantis was right when he said at the debate that America is a nation in decline and that decline was a choice. He just wasn’t right in the way he meant it. We’re in decline because a spirit of lawlessness, shamelessness and brainlessness has become a leading feature of a conservative movement that was supposed to be a bulwark against all three.”"

"As New Zealand’s election approaches, there is a swing away from the major parties in favour of smaller groupings on the political fringes that could end up deciding the direction of the next government. Support for parties at the centre of New Zealand politics has dropped to its lowest point in two decades with Labour on 27% and National on 34.5%, according to the September Guardian Essential poll. The combined “centre” now sits at 61.5% – its lowest point since 2002 – down from 81% at the 2017 election and 76% in 2020. The rising cost of living and post-pandemic malaise has translated into dissatisfaction with the political status quo. In August’s Guardian Essential poll, 70% of people were “finding it a bit difficult” or “struggling” to afford food and groceries, and 55% said the country was “on the wrong track”. Alongside those sentiments was a disillusionment with the main political options on offer: with 46% of those polled in September strongly or somewhat agreeing with the statement that “none of the current options for prime minister really appeal to me”. That dissatisfaction has left around a third of voters choosing smaller parties on the margins – a jump up from the 2020 election, which saw roughly 20% of votes go to minor parties."

After that event , House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he asked Trump not to declare his 2024 candidacy until after the midterms , the implication being that it would be better for Republicans if the midterms were about inflation , immigration , crime and not the polarizing former president . Senior Democratic strategist Karen Finney says that part of what Biden is trying to do by talking about Trump and Trumpism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at arm 's length . `` You know it 's not just about Trump , '' she said . `` Look at how many candidates in this Republican primary season , whether they got Trump 's approval or not , were vying for it .

But then along comes Trump with all his teasing about a 2024 run . Shakir calls it a `` gift '' for Biden and Democrats . `` The challenge for Biden has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , '' said Shakir , referring to Biden 's low approval rating , which reflects some of that Democratic lethargy . `` You have a stance on Biden one way or another .

"MOBILE, ALA. — Here in my home state, history doesn’t echo so much as it shouts and screams and yells. It is hardly a surprise, then, that Alabama’s right-wing officials recently chose, in effect, to stand in the schoolhouse door, as Gov. George Wallace did in a performative display 60 years ago. It is also hardly a surprise that they were slapped down by federal authorities, as the state’s racist officials were back then. This latest display of disrespect for constitutional authority came after the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling in June that sustained a key feature of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The ruling required the Alabama Legislature to redraw congressional districts so that two, not one, would have populations “in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it.” Tipping their hats to their bigoted predecessors, the Alabama Legislature’s GOP members ignored the ruling. They simply refused to do what the nation’s highest court had ordered. A state with a long history of resisting the U.S. Constitution, especially its insistence on the fair treatment of minority groups, once again lived down to its reputation."

The court papers say Allen played an important role in shifting the U.S. ’ s response . Specifically , authorities say Allen lobbied then-National Security Advisor H.R .

In an email to McMaster , Allen said the Qataris wanted the White House or State Department to issue a statement with language calling on all sides of the Gulf diplomatic crisis to “ act with restraint. ” Federal law enforcement officials say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that two days later , issuing a statement that called on other Gulf countries to “ ease the blockade against Qatar ” and asked “ that there be no further escalation by the parties in the region. ” The Qatar Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment . As part of the lobbying campaign , federal law enforcement authorities say , Olson and Allen traveled to Qatar to meet with the country 's ruling emir and other top officials . At the meeting , Allen provided advice on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should “ use the full spectrum ” of information operations , including “ black and white ” operations , the affidavit says . “ Black ” operations are typically covert and sometimes illegal . Qatar has been accused of orchestrating hack-and-leak operations of its critics and rivals during the diplomatic crisis , including one targeting a UAE ambassador . Qatar has denied any wrongdoing .

Allen suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $ 20,000 “ speaker ’ s fee ” for the weekend trip — even though he wasn ’ t giving a speech — and then later “ work out a fuller arrangement of a longer-term relationship , '' the affidavit says .

After returning from their trip to Qatar , Allen and Olson lobbied members of Congress , particularly those who supported a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the FBI said . Among them was Rep.

Furthermore , the price of diesel has gone up by 52.4 percent , the outlet reported , citing AAA data . Industries such as farming and shipping depend on diesel fuel , so higher diesel prices mean higher prices for the goods diesel vehicles produce and transport .

To put things into perspective , a year ago , the average national price for regular gasoline was $ 3.036 , according to data published by the AAA . Despite these figures , Biden told reporters at a Monday news conference in Japan that his administration ’ s efforts have stopped gas prices “ from getting worse , ” according to Fox Business . Biden also touted the soaring fuel prices as an opportunity for a national transition into renewable energy . “ And when it comes to the gas prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible transition that is taking place that , God willing , when it ’ s over , we ’ ll be stronger and the world will be stronger and less reliant on fossil fuels when this is over , ” Biden said at the news conference , according to Newsweek . Biden ’ s comments swiftly drew backlash from social media users and Republican lawmakers , who deemed the president ’ s words as being out of touch with the American public . “ He ’ s in Tokyo celebrating , saying ‘ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ” Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said during an appearance Monday on Fox News ’ “ Hannity. ” “ Incredible for you ! You fly a damn 747 where the taxpayers pay for your jet fuel , ” Cruz said , addressing the president . “ What Joe Biden is saying is , iff you at home , if you drive a pickup truck : ‘ To hell with you .

"WASHINGTON (AP) — After months of struggling to find agreement on just about anything in a divided Congress, lawmakers are returning to Capitol Hill to try to avert a government shutdown, even as House Republicans consider whether to press forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. A short-term funding measure to keep government offices fully functioning will dominate the September agenda, along with emergency funding for Ukraine, federal disaster funds and the Republican-driven probe into Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings. Time is running short for Congress to act. The House is scheduled to meet for just 11 days before the government's fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, leaving little room to maneuver. And the deal-making will play out as two top Republicans, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, deal with health issues."

""""""" WASHINGTON — Faced with Republican resistance after asking for billions of additional dollars to keep fighting the coronavirus , the Biden administration recently supplied Congress with a chart showing how much money it had left for testing , therapeutics and vaccines . It was filled with zeros . But Wednesday , Democrats in Congress stripped a $ 15.6 billion emergency aid package from a broader spending bill amid disputes over how to cover the cost . The move injects uncertainty into President Joe Biden ’ s plan , announced last week , to address “ urgent needs ” in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variants . With Republicans blocking new spending on the pandemic , Democrats had agreed to take the emergency aid from existing programs — including $ 7 billion that states had been counting on for their own pandemic response . That led governors to protest , rank-and-file lawmakers to balk and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to plan on passing the coronavirus funding package separately , a risky move given Republican opposition to new federal spending in the evenly divided Senate . Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue to secure supplies of essential treatments for COVID-19 and to develop next-generation vaccines . White House press secretary Jen Psaki laid out the administration ’ s predicament in dire terms at a news briefing last week . By May , she said , the current supply of monoclonal antibody drugs used to treat COVID-19 will “ stock out. ” By July , the administration will run out of another antibody drug , Evusheld , that was recently authorized to prevent COVID-19 in people with immune deficiencies . Money is needed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with drugmakers so there is no gap in deliveries . “ Let me be very clear , ” Psaki said . “ This is an urgent request. ” Over the past two years , Congress has appropriated more than $ 370 billion in pandemic response funds to the federal Department of Health and Human Services . The bulk of that money has been directed to health care providers ; less than half , about $ 140 billion , was for testing , therapeutics and vaccines . The administration ’ s spending chart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that all of the money has been spent or is already spoken for . ( That includes spending by the Trump administration . ) The Biden administration had initially asked Congress for $ 22.5 billion in additional pandemic aid , including $ 12 billion for procuring treatments and vaccines and $ 4.25 billion to support the global pandemic response ; Congress whittled the request down $ 15.6 billion . A White House spokesperson , Kevin Munoz , warned Wednesday that if Congress did not appropriate more funds , there would be consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said testing capacity would decline in March and the fund that pays for COVID-19 testing and treatments for tens of millions of uninsured Americans would run out of money in April . “ Failing to take action now will have severe consequences for the American people , ” Munoz said . What happens next is unclear . House Democrats , switching gears at the last minute , abandoned a plan to vote Wednesday evening on a stand-alone bill to approve the coronavirus aid , which would be partially offset with some unspent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local aid . Unless the bill is fully paid for , it is likely to face a dim future in the Senate , where 10 Republican votes are needed to pass most bills . A group of three dozen Republican senators , led by Mitt Romney of Utah , told the White House last week that they would not consider billions in new COVID-19 relief spending without a more detailed accounting of how earlier allocations had been spent and whether any money was left . “ It is not yet clear why additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a letter to Biden . Public health experts , many of whom expect a new coronavirus variant to emerge at some point , were aghast at Wednesday ’ s developments . They worried that the rapid decline in coronavirus cases was giving rise to a false sense of security on Capitol Hill . New virus cases in the United States have plunged in recent weeks , but about 1,500 Americans are still dying from the virus each day on average . “ Hopefully this is a procedural action , because if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , ” said Michael T. Osterholm , director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota . “ This should be a deja vu moment all over again , ” he added . “ It was a year ago right now that we were beginning to declare independence from COVID and we were certain that we were hitting that endemic period . Society learned that the virus wasn ’ t done with us yet. ” This week , a group of independent health experts who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osterholm , issued their own pandemic preparedness plan , which they called a “ road map for living with COVID. ” The group ’ s leader , Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel , has estimated that it will cost $ 100 billion or more to fully prepare the nation for future variants and pandemics moving forward . Adriane Casalotti , chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials , also said more money was needed . “ The funding deal on the table was really focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments — which is critical , but did not include resources to drive consumer awareness and demand so that they reach those who need them , ” she said . “ We hope negotiators can come back to the table to find a way forward to fund the full range of COVID-19 response needs. ” Some governors , upset that Congress was planning to take away some of their pandemic response money from last year ’ s $ 1.9 trillion stimulus law , were happy with Wednesday ’ s developments . Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Governors Association , said he was “ very pleased ” that the coronavirus supplement was removed from the bill . Many states already had plans in place to spend the stimulus money that Congress wanted to divert , he said . “ Arkansas does not need to have additional COVID funds , ” Hutchinson said . “ But the last thing we need is to have the additional funds taken away that ’ s designed for broadband and other infrastructure needs. ” Hutchinson , a Republican , and Gov . Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vice chair of the National Governors Association , put pressure on lawmakers to preserve the funding for state and local governments and urged them to “ negotiate in good faith ” in a letter to congressional leadership Tuesday . Gov . Tony Evers of Wisconsin , a Democrat , also sent a letter to congressional leaders Wednesday condemning the plan , which he said would cost his state about $ 225 million . Brian Sigritz , director of state fiscal studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers , said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30 states that had not yet received their full share of the stimulus money . Under the plan , states would have received at least 91 % of the $ 195 billion in total funding they were expecting . And while Pelosi said earlier Wednesday that localities would receive “ no cuts , ” local leaders had also expressed dismay with the proposal to scale back state funding , which they said would have ultimately affected cities and towns .

""""""" This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form . AMY GOODMAN : “ The Ransom. ” That ’ s the name of a major series of articles published by The New York Times detailing how Haiti became one of the poorest countries in the world , while bankers in France and the United States made a fortune . The story dates back to the early 19th century . In 1804 , the enslaved people of Haiti rose up , leading a rebellion against French colonial rule , founding the world ’ s first Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1825 , Haiti agreed to pay reparations to France for lost so-called property , including enslaved people , that French owners lost in the rebellion . France threatened to invade and reimpose slavery if Haiti did not agree to a staggering amount in reparations : 150 million francs — 30 times Haiti ’ s annual revenue . Haiti began taking out loans from French banks , leading to an economic crisis that continues through to this day . The New York Times estimates Haiti paid the equivalent of what ’ s now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next seven decades . The true economic cost to Haiti is estimated to be an astounding $ 115 billion . And that only tells a part of the story . In 1880 , a French bank established Haiti ’ s first national bank , essentially putting France in control of Haiti ’ s treasury . That bank , Crédit Industriel et Commercial , used some of its massive profits to help finance the Eiffel Tower . The bank ’ s current owner has just launched an investigation into its dealings with Haiti and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ecosystem of colonialism — that bank , CIC . The Times series also looks at the U.S. military occupation of Haiti that lasted from 1915 to 1934 . A key backer of the U.S. occupation was the National City Bank of New York , the predecessor of Citibank . Former U.S. diplomat Patrick Gaspard , who now heads the Center for American Progress , has called on Citigroup to pay reparations to Haiti . Gaspard wrote on Twitter , “ A silent scream has been in throats for decades about the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would listen . Finally some truths , ” he said . Over the years , Haitian demands for reparations have been repeatedly shut down — sometimes with force . France ’ s former ambassador to Haiti , Thierry Burkhard , admitted to The New York Times that France and the United States effectively orchestrated the 2004 coup that ousted Haiti ’ s first democratically elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide . Burkhard said one benefit of the coup was that it ended Aristide ’ s campaign demanding France pay financial reparations to Haiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devastating impact of colonialism and this massive series in The New York Times , we ’ re joined by two guests . Westenley Alcenat is a Haitian American professor at Fordham University , where he teaches courses on the Atlantic slave trade , the American abolition movement and Afro-Caribbean history . Gerald Horne also joins us . He ’ s professor of history and African American studies at the University of Houston , author of many books , including Confronting Black Jacobins : The U.S. , the Haitian Revolution , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome you both to Democracy Now ! Professor Alcenat , let ’ s begin with you . So , this series has come out in The New York Times to both criticism and praise . It ’ s come out in both Creole and in English . That ’ s a first for The New York Times . Can you explain the significance of what many are calling revelations — at least , to the general public — but certainly people in Haiti have been alleging for centuries , not only alleging but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? WESTENLEY ALCENAT : Yes . Thank you , Amy . Thank you for having me today . I ’ m glad to be here in conversation with you . So , first , let me start by saying that — a great acknowledgment to the many reporters and producers who put this very special issue together and to have given it a front-time exposure . And it will mean a lot — not really for Haitians per se , because the facts that are being revealed throughout the report are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haitian and even to the youngest Haitian growing up . In fact , given the level of underdevelopment that is prevalent in Haiti today , one knows — at least the Haitian people know — that this could have only been the legacy of an external force , rather of their own making . So , I think the significance of the piece will be that it exposes the rest of the world to a knowledge that actually has existed for over a hundred years and shares multiple partners , both in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , as well as United States government , Germany , Great Britain and , most certainly and most influential , France , having played a role in imposing the debt that in many ways will explain Haiti ’ s poverty today . So , I welcome the piece . I think it ’ s great in terms of the many research that it brought together both from academic literature that had already existed , as well as new revelations that are coming up . But in terms of calling it “ revelations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I myself have written very extensively on the subject . Many other fellow academics , historians have written about it . There have been movements over the decades to get the United States , France and the other parties responsible for this , to get them to some accountability . And I believe a large reason why this never got the fair sort of ear of listening that it should have gotten is because it ’ s coming from Haitians , whom many people view as sort of the Africans of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity that Haitians pridely wear — wear proudly , for reasons that reasonably make sense in terms of the freedom that they fought and established for all Black people . JUAN GONZÁLEZ : Yeah , I ’ d like to bring in professor Gerald Horne to the conversation , another historian who has covered the issue of colonialism , imperialism and slavery throughout the Americas for decades . I , too , had the same feeling that a lot of this is only new to people who haven ’ t paid attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last several hundred years . I ’ m wondering your reaction to the piece , because the Times really is delving into history much more than news . I think the most interesting aspect of it was the particular individuals in France and the institutions that directly benefited from the ransom that Haiti was forced to pay , but , largely , this is history that is known by people who know any part of the history of Latin America and of the Western Hemisphere . So I ’ m wondering your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ’ s studied this carefully ? GERALD HORNE : Well , first of all , I would urge and encourage The New York Times to follow through with their point that they have uncovered new documents , by putting these documents online so that other historians can take advantage of their excavations and/or , secondly , placing them at The New York Times archive , which I believe has been sited at the New York Public Library . But I think that the story also is of significance and of moment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we in the United States , because there has been this myth that has been created that the United States and the Haitian Revolution were twins , even though we know , as I begin my book on the Haitian Revolution , George Washington , the Founding Father of this country , was quite nervous about the eruption in Haiti in August 1791 . And this was understandable , because the Haitian Revolution , culminating in 1804 , led to a general crisis of the entire slave system in the Americas that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , the United States was probably second to France in being an antagonist of the Haitian people . From their point of view , this was a reaction to the fact that many of the slave revolts in the United States had Haitian fingerprints all over them . I ’ m speaking of Gabriel ’ s revolt in Virginia in 1800 , the revolt in Louisiana circa 1811 , Denmark Vesey about a decade later in South Carolina . In fact , Vesey had sailed in and out of Haiti before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , culminating this hostility to Haiti , there is substantial evidence to suggest that when the island , the island that we refer to as Hispaniola , was split in 1844 with the secession from Haiti of what became the Dominican Republic , that this was an early success for U.S. covert operations . So , this story in The New York Times is of significance for we in the United States . Hopefully , it will cause us to reexamine the history of this country and move away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an abolitionist republic , when actually it was the foremost slaveholders ’ republic . JUAN GONZÁLEZ : And I ’ m wondering also if it wouldn ’ t have been worthwhile for The New York Times to do another piece on its own coverage of Haiti over the past hundred years or so . I ’ m thinking back , for instance , during the first coup against President Aristide , when there were numerous articles in The New York Times about how Aristide was considered to be mentally unstable and erratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed to it by intelligence sources , and even the Times 's coverage perhaps of the U.S. occupation , that long occupation in the early 20th century . The Times seems to be willing to go after France and the U.S. , but really does n't look at its own role in creating the narrative of Haiti as a dysfunctional country . I ’ m wondering what you think about that , Gerald . GERALD HORNE : Well , you ’ re absolutely correct . Obviously , criticism should be accompanied by self-criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done in that sphere by The New York Times . You mentioned the occupation , 1915 to 1934 . The United States did not — excuse me , The New York Times did not necessarily stress and emphasize in their coverage the mass opposition to the U.S. occupation , particularly by Black Americans , particularly by a founder of the NAACP , speaking of W.E.B . Du Bois , who , as you know , his ancestral roots were in fact on the island . And he led a vigorous campaign against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some ways involved the reassertion of unpaid labor , the so-called corvée , as it was called euphemistically , in Haiti . And The New York Times would do well to reexamine its own coverage , because hopefully that would improve today ’ s coverage . AMY GOODMAN : Well , I want to go back to 2004 . Juan just referred to this . France ’ s former ambassador to Haiti has admitted France and the United States effectively orchestrated the 2004 coup that overthrew Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , Haiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The former French ambassador , Thierry Burkhard , told The New York Times one benefit of the coup was that it ended Aristide ’ s campaign demanding France pay reparations to Haiti . I want to turn to an interview we did with Kim Ives of Haïti Liberté . This was right after President Aristide was put on a plane and sent to the Central African Republic . This was what Kim Ives described . AMY GOODMAN : So , just to be clear , this is mid-March 2004 that Kim Ives was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now ! , I flew to the Central African Republic on a small plane , covering a group of African American activists and politicians , including Randall Robinson of TransAfrica , as well as Congressmember Maxine Waters , who went to the Central African Republic to retrieve the Aristides and then brought them back to the Western Hemisphere as the U.S. government was saying , “ How dare you bring them to this hemisphere ? ” to which Randall Robinson responded , “ Whose hemisphere ? ” They eventually brought them to Haiti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile in South Africa for years , before they eventually went back to Haiti , where they are today . I ’ d like to get response , starting with Professor Horne and then Professor Alcenat , about the significance of these coups , whether we ’ re talking about Aristide in the early ’ 90s or again in 2004 , the coups against them , and what that meant for this country . I mean , no president again would demand reparations . GERALD HORNE : Well , the reparations question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what makes the United States unique is that the slave owners were expropriated . Their property , in the bodies of enslaved Africans , was taken without compensation . That helped to give rise to the terrorism of the Ku Klux Klan . In Haiti , as we ’ ve been discussing , the Haitians were obligated to pay back , believe it or not , the enslavers . And likewise , if you look at the British possessions , so-called — Jamaica , Barbados , etc . — you had London compensate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures , that total was not paid off until just a few years ago . And so , this question of reparations is quite key . And also quite key is the role of Haiti in helping to ignite this entire process of abolition , leading to capital loss , not least in the United States of America . The enslaving class and their descendants have a very long memory . They have not forgotten Haiti ’ s role . That ’ s why they continued to punish Haiti for having the temerity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even today , they continue to punish Haiti because they see Haiti as a haven for low-wage labor . U.S. baseballs in the U.S. national pastime are largely manufactured by cheap labor in Haiti . So there is still much to sort out with regard to this entire controversy . AMY GOODMAN : And , Professor Alcenat , if you could also respond , right through to today , to the U.S. diplomat Patrick Gaspard , who now runs Center for American Progress , demanding Citibank launch an investigation , and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it actually being real , given the devastation of Haiti ? WESTENLEY ALCENAT : OK . Thank you , Amy . I think I want to quickly go back to what was asked with regards to The New York Times . Let me remind our audience that it was in 2010 , just days after an earthquake had devastated the country and killed upwards of 200,000 and more people , that The New York Times provided a platform for one of its columnists , David Brooks , to say some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever read in The New York Times about Haiti . So , if we are going to also give The New York Times the credit for what is a phenomenal job about talking on this issue , they should also start by apologizing for what Mr. Brooks had said then , which — let me quote real quick : “ Haiti , like most of the world ’ s poorest nations , suffers from a complex web of progress-resistant cultural influences . There is the influence of the voodoo religion , which spreads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning futile . There are high levels of social mistrust . Responsibility is often not internalized . Child-rearing practices often involve neglect in the early years and harsh retribution when kids hit 9 or 10 . “ We ’ re all supposed to politely respect each other ’ s cultures . But some cultures are more progress-resistant than others , and a horrible tragedy was just exacerbated by one of them. ” So I call on The New York Times to both acknowledge the statements of racist demagoguery on its pages from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves . They can go back and look at the op-ed and its pseudo-intellectual anthropologizing of Haitians . So , that ’ s one . And with regards to Mr. Gaspard , I believe he actually served in the Obama administration . And most people should know that President Obama , being himself the first Black African American president of the United States , actually never made an official visit to the first Black republic in the world , the very nation without which Mr. Obama would have not assumed the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States as he had . So , I would like to know from Mr. Gaspard why is that the administration never actually took the very official position that he is taking right now with regards to Haitian poverty and underdevelopment and the explicit role that the United States , France , Canada and Germany have played in all of that . And then , lastly , I just want to respond to your question with regards to just the immensity of the debt and the destructive legacy it has had for Haiti . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even once this debt is paid , if it were to ever be paid , which , like Professor Horne , I believe there are parties that are invested in never actually making realizing that possibility — even if that debt were to be paid , we are already talking about decades of gaps in development that were missed in the process because of where the money was going — something like upwards to 80 % of all Haitian expenditures up until the early part of the 20th century was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that American firms from Wall Street in cahoots with the federal government in terms of the State Department , the Navy . And you have names like General Smedley Butler , who actually wrote about his role as the Marines in Haiti and how he secured the interest of the financial corporate groups , as well as working with the State Department to make sure that Haiti becomes a haven for capitalism , as he said . And also , we can even see FDR , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , himself had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that Haiti was invaded and becoming a protectorate , essentially , of the United States . And he , too , had professed to actually amending the Haitian Constitution to take out a very revolutionary constitutional clause that had banned white males from owning land in Haiti . Among the first constitutional clauses that the occupation targeted was that , and therefore opened the country up to internal meddling by the international powers . But lastly , I just want to also note the fact that with regards to what you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industriel , which is now a part of Crédit Agricole , one of the largest banks in the world , I think among the 10th largest banks in the world , having funded the building of the Eiffel Tower , which is now this massive monument to French industrial progress , that was happening at a moment in which the United States , France , Germany and parts of Western Europe were developing rapidly from the capital that they were extracting from many of their former colonies or their current colonies . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of development in Haiti be today , if at the same time that the world is undergoing industrial transformations the likes of which we see today in the form of the Eiffel Tower — what if that money that was taken from Haiti , financing French infrastructure , was financing Haitian infrastructure instead ? The fact of the matter is , there is no progress-resistant genes that somehow Haitians are born with . Perhaps someone like David Brooks was born with that , with some progress-resistant gene , as he is unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . But the truth goes to show where the receipts are in terms of why we know Haiti is in the position that it is today . JUAN GONZÁLEZ : I ’ d like to ask Gerald Horne — the bank aspect of this reporting , which to me is , I think , the most newsworthy , in that the Times actually was able to get a hold , in French archives , of financial arrangements that were made between banking interests in France and Haiti , as well as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of First National City Bank in the early 20th century in Haiti . So , I think that this is some of the best stuff in this report , but it ’ s almost like , “ Hey , New York Times discovers imperialism. ” Isn ’ t the role of Wall Street and European banks in controlling the economies , not just of Haiti but of Honduras , of Nicaragua , of Cuba , of many of these countries in Latin America , part of the operational mold of American imperialism ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that the series , laudable as it has been , could also have made a contribution if it had pointed out the close connections between France and the United States . That is to say , in the 20th century , they began to talk about Citibank and Citicorp and how it was involved in the depredations inflicted upon Haiti , but I think if you were to go back to the Haitian revolutionary period , you would also find similar connections . After all , we know that what became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolt against London that would not have succeeded without the assistance of France . We know that there was substantial French migration to [ inaudible ] States and that Frenchmen were involved in similar depredations in Louisiana and slave owning , for example . We know that when Texas seceded from Mexico in 1836 , that Texas ’ s major diplomatic ally on the international front happened to be France . And we also know that when the United States Civil War erupted , 1861 to 1865 , it was France that opportunistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occupy Mexico , and then extend the lease on life of slavery in Texas and throughout the South by welcoming slave owners from Texas and from Dixie into French-occupied Mexico . And it took a mass revolt by the Mexican people to overturn that particular scheme . So there is much more digging and excavation that needs to be done . And I would like to reiterate my call for The New York Times to open the kimono and to disgorge these documents they say that they have uncovered in France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can examine same . AMY GOODMAN : We haven ’ t even talked about the Louisiana Purchase , but we can ’ t in this show . However , I want to end on the crisis that Haitians confront today when they try to come into the United States . I think it was last September the U.S. special envoy to Haiti resigned in protest over the Biden administration ’ s policies . In a letter , the longtime diplomat , U.S. envoy to Haiti Daniel Foote , wrote , “ I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ inhumane , counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees. ” Foote also criticized the Biden administration for meddling in Haiti ’ s political affairs , including its support for Ariel Henry as prime minister following the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse in July . Foote ’ s resignation came just days after U.S. Border Patrol agents on horseback were filmed chasing , grabbing and whipping Haitian asylum seekers who had gathered in that makeshift camp in Del Rio , Texas . We only have a minute , Professor Alcenat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deported by the thousands back to a devastated Haiti ? WESTENLEY ALCENAT : Well , real quick , I think what you ’ ve just demonstrated is that Haiti stands as a singular metaphor for understanding the racial legacy of imperial powers like the United States and France . In fact , as the war in Ukraine is happening , the sheer magnitude of the difference in the treatment of certain refugees because of their European background relative to , say , Haitians , as you just showed in terms of what ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s a very revealing example of what Haiti not only means to the United States , but what it means to the world at large in terms of populations from formerly colonized geographies , as well as Black , Brown and Indigenous people in this country , who knows something about the treatment of racism at the hands of the U.S. government . So , in many ways , Haiti should be looked at as a singular metaphor for explaining so many of these various mistreatments and levels of preference for different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learn about Haiti , the more we realize how our fate — and this is not an overstatement — our fate is actually directly connected to it , if we are going to better understand what world we ’ re living in with regards to how the powers that be intend to engineer the world towards imperialism . AMY GOODMAN : Our fates intertwined , going right back to the U.S. not recognizing Haiti ’ s independence for decades , fearing that a slave uprising would inspire enslaved people in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanks so much for being with us , Haitian American professor at Fordham University , where he teaches courses on the Atlantic slave trade , the American abolition movement and Afro-Caribbean history . And thank you , Gerald Horne , professor of history and African American studies at the University of Houston , author of many books , including Confronting Black Jacobins : The U.S. , the Haitian Revolution , and the Origins of the Dominican Republic .

"Happy Saturday! Here’s another edition of my weekend column for WPRI.com — as always, send your takes, tips and trial balloons to tnesi@wpri.com and follow me on Twitter and on Facebook. Close Thanks for signing up! Watch for us in your inbox. 1. As Rhode Island’s candidates for Congress embark on a final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday’s primary, Aaron Regunberg appears to be in the driver’s seat. His leftist message — validated by Bernie Sanders and AOC, and paired with plenty of money and relentless organizing — has him well-positioned in a race many think can be won with less than 30% of the vote. If Regunberg comes up short, it may turn out he peaked too early, turning him into a human piñata for the final stretch of the campaign. The opponent Regunberg and his allies seem most concerned about is Gabe Amo, who has gained momentum since releasing an internal poll showing him in second place. Amo needs to cut into Regunberg’s margins on Providence’s East Side and do well in the East Bay if he wants to be successful. Sandra Cano’s team has gotten used to being underestimated over the course of the campaign; they’re banking on robust get-out-the-vote efforts by the politicians and unions who’ve endorsed her. “It’s a risky strategy, it’s a narrow path, but it’s a path that could work in an election when you have 12 people on the ballot,” our political analyst Joe Fleming said of Cano on this week’s Newsmakers. Meanwhile, it’s a mark of how far onetime frontrunner Sabina Matos has fallen that if she wins the race it would now qualify as a major upset. Still, over $1 million has been spent trying to elect Matos; it’s possible she could outperform the diminished expectations. And remember: this thing could be very close. If voter turnout is between 30,000 and 40,000, as Fleming expects, the winning Democrat may not even need to crack 10,000 to capture the nomination. 2. One interesting subplot this final week has been the competing efforts to define Aaron Regunberg for primary voters. Regunberg has always positioned himself to the left of Rhode Island’s congressional delegation; he is more of an Elizabeth Warren/Ed Markey Democrat than a Jack Reed/Sheldon Whitehouse one. (And if you think all four of them are the same, I’ve got news for you.) Throughout the campaign, Regunberg has seemed unsure of how he wanted to handle that tension. He grabbed headlines by saying he would vote “no” on the debt-ceiling deal, yet wouldn’t criticize Rhode Island’s current delegation for all voting “yes,” and then in our debate went so far as to say he himself would have voted “yes” if necessary to pass the bill. And over the course of this week Regunberg seemed to go out of his way to align himself with the delegation, praising David Cicilline and Sheldon Whitehouse in debates and even calling Cicilline “a Rhode Island hero” in a tweet Friday. But Patrick Kennedy, who is making an energetic last-minute push for Gabe Amo and of course knows the delegation’s dynamics well, made the counterargument while speaking to reporters Friday. “The notion that he would come out against the largest economic driver in the 1st District, the defense economy, left me flabbergasted,” Kennedy said of Regunberg, adding, “The way you fight for Rhode Island jobs is you don’t cancel out Jack Reed, who’s chairman of the appropriations for defense spending. That’s what Aaron Regunberg would do.” If Regunberg wins, his relationship with Reed will be interesting to watch."

"When I heard that Salvador Allende won the Chilean presidential elections in September 1970 and sought to bring his country to socialism by peaceful means, I decided to do my doctoral dissertation on Chile. In May 1972, I went to take a crash course in Spanish in Cuernavaca in the Mexican state of Morelos, the birthplace of the legendary peasant leader Emiliano Zapata whose life had been made into a movie starring Marlon Brando that I had seen and liked as a teenager. After three weeks, I felt that the course had substantially improved the rudimentary Spanish I had from high school in the Philippines. So, I flew to Santiago, arriving in the capital in the midst of the Chilean winter, greeted by tear gas and skirmishes of opposing political groups in the aftermath of a demonstration. Hauling two suitcases, I made it with great difficulty from the bus depot to the historic Hotel Claridge, a few blocks from La Moneda, the presidential palace. Two expectations were immediately dashed when I arrived in Santiago. The first was that I could get by with my “Mexican-Filipino” Spanish. This could only be remedied through daily conversations with Chileans, and I soon learned how to swallow consonants at the end of a word, as in mao o meno instead of mas o menos. The second was that the topic for my dissertation, leftist organizing in the callampas, or shantytowns, was worth pursuing. A few weeks in Santiago disabused me of the impression of a revolutionary momentum that I had gathered reading about events in Chile in left-wing publications in the United States. People on the left were constantly being mobilized for marches and rallies in the center of Santiago, and increasingly, the reason for this was to counter the demonstrations mounted by the right. My friends brought me to these events, where there were an increasing number of skirmishes with right-wing thugs."
"Abraham Lincoln was our first Republican president. By taking on the mission of preserving the Union and eventually destroying slavery, the Republican Party’s central value was preserving and enhancing individual freedom and civil rights. That central value was eloquently expressed in Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address – “that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom.” When I witness the looming candidacy of Donald Trump, I lament how far the Republican party has strayed from that central value. Consider this hate-filled quote from Trump: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems to us. They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.” The Party of Lincoln, the party founded on valuing the dignity of all people, would counter Trump’s hateful harangue by saying, “It’s not just “some” of these Mexicans but almost all of them who are good people. They are seeking opportunities for a better life, not for themselves but for their children.”"

""""""" Marking 75 years , the CIA opens a new museum and launches a podcast The CIA is marking its 75th anniversary by doing something extremely rare : actively seeking public attention . The spy agency has just launched a podcast , and over the weekend it gave a small number of journalists a peek inside its newly renovated and greatly expanded museum at CIA headquarters in Langley , Va. Perhaps the most unusual touch is the ceiling , covered with a variety of white and black spy codes . There 's a section in Morse code , another displays dominoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what looks like a crossword puzzle filled with letters in various foreign languages , jumbled together . The CIA has never opened its museum to the public and is n't about to start . The target audience is the CIA staff and official visitors . But the agency is planning to put the exhibits — and these spy codes — online . `` Every code can be broken . There are actual words and meaning behind everything , '' said the museum 's deputy director , Janelle Neises , who gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious to see how fast and who breaks it . '' The exhibit features some of the CIA 's best-known operations since its founding in 1947 , right up to a high-profile operations carried out less than two months ago . There 's a table-top model of Osama bin Laden 's compound in Pakistan , where the al-Qaida leader was killed by Navy SEALS in 2011 . The CIA also built a life-size model as well where the SEAL team trained for the raid . Also on display is the bread-box sized replica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the CIA tracked bin Laden 's successor , Ayman al-Zawahiri , and killed him in missile strike in July . `` This model was actually used to brief President Biden on the pattern of life that had been established , why we thought Zawahiri was here with his family , and what our plan was to go and get him , '' said Neises . The museum tells stories well-known inside the intelligence community , though much less so outside the CIA 's walls . Like the work of Oleg Penkovsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He provided the U.S. with critical information that allowed President John F. Kennedy to confront the Soviets over their secret plans to place ballistic missiles in Cuba in 1962 . `` Col. Oleg Penkovsky was one of our most important assets during the Cold War , '' said Neises . `` He 's known as the 'spy who saved the world ' for a reason . '' The Soviets withdrew their missiles from Cuba . They also uncovered Penkovsky 's spying and executed him the following year . A separate exhibit features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who passed secrets to Moscow for millions in cash until he was arrested in suburban Washington in 1994 . He 's serving a life sentence . These tales , and several others , are pointed reminders that spy stories often end badly . The museum also includes some CIA failures , like the Bay of Pigs , the disastrous 1961 attempt to oust Cuban leader Fidel Castro . This was just one of many CIA attempts against Castro , who eventually stepped down due to failing health and died six years ago at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the CIA museum with a small statue carved with coconuts and known as `` Coconut Castro . '' The caption offers not hint it had anything to do with the many plots directed at him . It says only that the unnamed owner — presumably a former CIA official — would turn it to face away from the television during Castro 's marathon speeches in hopes it would bring them to an end more quickly . `` I honestly do n't know who made it and why , '' said Neises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency 's long-running obsession with the Cuban dictator . `` Looking at the 75-year track record of CIA , it has enhanced American security by giving us much better information about the world through science and technology and the serious information-gathering side of the agency , '' said Tom Blanton , head of the National Security Archive , a private group in Washington that keeps watch on the intelligence community . But Blanton says the CIA 's covert paramilitary operations , like the many attempts aimed at Castro , `` have driven up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' While the CIA museum is off-limits to the public , the agency is reaching out in another way , with its first podcast , called The Langley Files , a nod to the agency 's location in suburban Washington . Hosted by Dee and Walter — first names only for these CIA employees — the first guest last week was CIA Director William Burns , who explains the thinking behind the media venture . `` We do usually operate in the shadows , out of sight , out of mind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves the best we can and to demystify a little bit of what we do . '' In recent years , former top intelligence officials have been much more willing to speak publicly , from cable television appearances to social media accounts . And a former deputy director at the CIA , Michael Morell , already has his own podcast , Intelligence Matters . CIA headquarters features a number of statues as well as paintings of former agency directors and others who had distinguished intelligence careers . Almost all were white men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up a statue , near the headquarters entrance , of Harriet Tubman . While famous for leading enslaved blacks to freedom during the Civil War period , she was at the same time serving as a valuable spy for the Union Army . `` As she 's doing her work , she 's learning different things about the Confederate Army , and she 's able to pass that information on to the Union soldiers , '' Neises said . `` She was running intelligence before ( the CIA ) existed . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who deserved to be on our compound . '' By CIA standards , all these recent events surrounding the agency 's 75th anniversary seem like a full-scale publicity blitz . Yet the CIA had already taken unusually public steps earlier this year in advance of Russia 's war in Ukraine . The Biden administration and the U.S. intelligence community declassified some of the information that they said pointed to a Russian invasion .

"The other, more politically perilous option would be for one or more states to embrace the theory outright and simply refuse to list Trump on their ballots. That might force Trump to file his own lawsuits asking courts to order his candidacy restored in those states. So far, no state has moved to bar Trump from the ballot, though secretaries of state around the nation are discussing the issue among themselves. Either scenario could thrust the courts, and likely the Supreme Court, into an unsettled debate over the meaning of the insurrection clause, a long-winded 110-word provision that was ratified in 1868 and has rarely been interpreted — or even invoked — since then.

"Listen to this article. On the last morning of July, Kristen Chapman was getting ready to leave Nashville. Chapman, who is in her early fifties and wears her silver hair short, sat on a camp chair next to a fire pit outside the rental duplex where her family had lived for twelve years. She was smoking an American Spirit and swatting at the mosquitoes that kept emerging from the dense green brush behind her. Her husband, Paul, who was wearing a T-shirt with the Guinness logo, carried boxes out to the front lawn. Their daughters, Saoirse and Willow, who were seventeen and fifteen, were inside, still asleep. Chapman looked down at the family’s beagle mix, Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was drinking rainwater out of a plastic bucket. “We got him when we moved in here for the kids,” she said. “He’s never lived anywhere else.” Paul was planning to stay in town; Chapman was heading to Richmond, Virginia, with Saoirse and Willow. Chapman and Paul’s marriage was ending, but the decision to split their family apart had happened abruptly. Willow is trans, and had been on puberty blockers since 2021.

But Schulczová had reckoned without the febrile politics and deep polarisation of her country before parliamentary elections on 30 September. The main image advertising the new season suggested a stained glass window, a reference to the Stalinist-era decorations of the theatre, with young people marching below Ukrainian, anti-fascist and rainbow flags. Within days, the inboxes of Schulczová and her staff were flooded with threats of rape and decapitation. An online petition demanding her dismissal was signed by thousands.

"Updated at 6:00 p.m. ET on September 26, 2023 In universities and newspapers, nonprofit organizations and even corporations, a new set of ideas about race, gender, and sexual orientation has gained huge influence. Attitudes to these ideas—which are commonly called “woke,” though I prefer a more neutral term, the “identity synthesis”—have split into two camps: those who blame them for all of America’s ills and those who defend them, largely uncritically. Right-wing polemicists deride these ideas as a form of “cultural Marxism,” which has substituted identity categories such as race for the economic category of class but still aims at the same old goal of communist revolution. They invoke wokeness to oppose anything they dislike, such as sex ed and insufficiently patriotic versions of American history."
"Five years ago, with Beto O’Rourke mounting an electrifying campaign to unseat Ted Cruz from the U.S. Senate, Democrats seemed hopeful that the political winds were shifting in Texas to one day make it a purple state. He ultimately lost by 2.6 percent amid a record turnout for a mid-term election. Since then, Democratic hopes for turning Texas into a swing state have diminished. In the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump made gains with Hispanic voters. And the state legislature has become increasingly conservative with a host of bills signed this year by Republican Governor Greg Abbott that include barring public universities from creating DEI offices, banning transgender athletes from college sports, and restricting labor rights. In 2022, abortion was banned in the state following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Feature director Andrew Morgan of Untold Creative — who’s previously tackled such subjects as the working conditions of fashion workers around the globe (2015’s The True Cost) and also helmed the 2021 narrative drama Samantha Rose — felt there was an underdog story to be told about politics in the state.

"Antoine Léaument I’m sometimes criticized on the grounds that, if it’s all very well to defend the tricolor and the Marseillaise, we end up becoming nationalists rather than internationalists. For me, the nation only makes sense in the context of internationalism. We don’t want there to be differences between the French and other peoples, precisely because what republican principles say is that we are brothers with other peoples, and that we need to find ways of working together democratically. Ultimately, the objective remains the same: to abolish capitalist society. I haven’t abandoned that in order to defend the tricolor flag. So, we have to stand together, collectively, across borders, to put an end to this system and create a solidarity that doesn’t exclude my fellow man just because he’s on the other side of a border. The 1793 Constitution says no generation has the right to enslave future generations, and that each generation has the right to revise its constitution. As you said, the 1958 Constitution came from a coup d’état. We want to revise it, because it is a quasi-monarchical document, with articles like 49.3 that allow the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote. We want a truly republican constitution that puts popular sovereignty first, and the brotherhood of peoples I mentioned earlier, in Mirabeau’s words."

The New Jersey Democrat long held one of the most powerful positions in the US Senate, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He used it to both promote the interests of American imperialism, particularly in Latin America and the Middle East, and to amass a fortune for himself, signaled by the wads of cash, totaling $480,000, and kilos of gold found in his house by federal agents. At a press briefing Monday morning, Menendez declared that he would not resign from the Senate and suggested that the indictment was in retaliation for his long record fighting for the interests of New Jersey citizens and as a supporter of Democratic Party policies on the expansion of social programs and democratic rights. Why this would lead the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, to bring a false indictment the senator did not bother to explain.

""""""" Ukraine is about much more than the security of one sovereign nation . The battle for Ukraine is a battle for the new world order . In that battle , Russian President Vladimir Putin is living up to the worst expectations of Western policymakers and analysts . Unlike Chinese President Xi Jinping , Mr. Putin is seeking to overthrow the current world order , at least as far Europe and the continent ’ s security architecture is concerned . By contrast , Mr. Xi would prefer to ensure China ’ s place in the existing world order , enhanced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , in doing so , Mr. Xi dangerously blurs the lines between maintaining and fundamentally altering the current world order . If the period since World War One was in the words of President Woodrow Wilson about “ making the world safe for democracy , ” today it is in the mind of Mr. Putin and the words of Financial Times columnist Gideon Rahman about “ making the world safe for autocrats. ” What Messrs. Putin and Xi have in common and share with a critical mass of other world leaders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkey ’ s Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Hungary ’ s Victor Orban , and former US President Donald J. Trump , is that they think in civilisational rather than national terms . In doing so , they define their nation ’ s borders in civilisational instead of internationally recognized legal terms . That is what Mr. Putin was talking about when he this week , slumped in a chair with a seemingly bored expression on his face , spoke for 90 minutes , during which he announced Russian recognition of two breakaway Ukrainian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of history was designed to justify Russian and Russian-backed infringements on Ukrainian territory and define the civilisational borders of what he calls the Russian world . The boundaries of that world are defined by the presence of Russian speakers and/or adherents to Russian culture on any given territory . That is the backdrop to Mr. Putin ’ s suggestion that none of the states that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union — except for Russia—were real countries and that Ukraine had no tradition of genuine statehood . Much like Saddam Hussein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion of Kuwait , Mr. Putin ’ s reasoning would deny legitimacy to most states in Europe and beyond . The same is true for Mr. Xi ’ s claims to the South China Sea or efforts to control the ethnic Chinese Diaspora . That matters little to Mr. Putin and other civilisationalist leaders whose world is one in which might is right . Russian recognition in 2008 of two breakaway republics in Georgia , the annexation of Crimea in 2014 , and fostering of secessionist insurgents in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of a significant number of Russian troops in Belarus prove the point . What has gone unnoticed is that since 2014 Mr. Putin has talked about Kazakhstan in terms of the same denial of a national history that he employs when he speaks about Ukraine . Weeks before Russian troops intervened early this year in Kazakhstan to squash mass anti-government protests and then quickly withdrew , Mr. Putin used an unrelated question posed by Kazakhstan TV to remind his audience that “ Kazakhstan is a Russian-speaking country in the full sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putin ’ s spokesman , hit the nail on the head when he recently noted that the Russian President ’ s autocratic domestic and foreign policies were just “ the starting point. ” Mr. Peskov ’ s suggestion that “ there ’ s a demand in the world for special , sovereign leaders , for decisive ones ” spoke to the fact that Mr. Putin has become a model for a class of world leaders that no longer finds it necessary to pay lip service to the rule of law . For these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , destabilisation , disinformation , and assassinating one ’ s opponents are the game ’ s new rules . Mr. Putin ’ s notion of the centrality of Ukraine for securing its place on the world stage has a long pedigree in militant Russian nationalism . It ’ s a notion that was acknowledged by senior US officials already decades ago . President Jimmy Carter ’ s Polish-born national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski noted in the 1990s that “ without Ukraine , Russia ceases to be an empire , but with Ukraine suborned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empire. ” What happens next in pursuit of Mr. Putin ’ s goal is anyone ’ s guess . However , his recognition of the breakaway republics implies that , despite having parliamentary authority to move troops at will across Russian borders , a full-scale invasion of Ukraine may be unlikely . A retired US general suggested on the sidelines of last week ’ s Munich Security Conference that Russia could “ invest ” the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv . The general was not speaking about financial investment ; he was reverting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe the siege of a city rather than its occupation that went out of fashion once the Cold War ended . Despite assertions to the contrary , Mr. Putin is not irrational and on the rampage . On the contrary , he is a brinksman who has proven to be a brilliant tactician . He knows that his demand that NATO withdraws from Eastern Europe and promise to bar Ukraine from EU and NATO membership is unrealistic . With the recognition of the breakaway Ukrainian republics , he has demonstrated that he ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctions . Russia has amassed some US $ 600 billion in reserves and reduced to 50 % the amount of trade conducted in dollars . As a result , Mr. Putin , so far , can look at his sparking and manipulation of the Ukraine crisis as a success despite much of the world condemning Russia , as was evident in the United Nations Security Council debate and the caution with which China commented on the crisis . Beyond sending a chilling message to republics across the former Soviet Union , Mr. Putin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time that liberal democracy is in crisis and under attack from illiberal and undemocratic elements on both the left and the right , some of which enjoy Russian empathy at the least . To be sure , Mr. Putin may have given NATO and Western solidarity a new lease on life , but the United States and Europe have yet to prove that they are up for the challenge . They have not developed an approach that acknowledges that the Russian leader is playing a long game despite assessing him as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unlikely to project the United States and Europe as capable of preventing Mr. Putin from establishing his new world order in the former Soviet Union or in lands where he could artificially create outposts of the Russian world by supporting Russian-language education as he is trying to do in the Central African Republic . Sanctions , no matter how painful , have so far proven to be ineffective in forcing policy , if not regime change . Take , for example , Iran . So far , harsh sanctions have not forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russia is better positioned to absorb the impact of punitive penalties . Add to this that Mr. Putin could be dealing with a different United States by the end of this year if US President Joe Biden were to lose the Senate and/or the House of Representatives in mid-term elections . Similarly , Mr. Putin could be dealing with a more empathetic French leader if President Emmanuel Macron fails to fend off his far-right challengers in April elections . Mr. Putin ’ s long game , says journalist and author Anne Applebaum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

"The next general election is a substantial political juncture, with the polls suggesting a likely change of government.

A Different Generation of Voters The Conservative Party is plagued by a chronic engagement problem with young people. Senior Conservative politicians and their values fail to strike a chord with young people and are regularly the subject of derision. Indeed, the collective noun ‘Tory’ has long been a synonym for an insult thrust into general conversation and social media dialogue. This clearly manifests itself in polling of 18-24-year-olds, with the Conservatives at 5 per cent, trailing Labour by 58 per cent. This phenomenon is not new, though. You must go back to 1983 for the last time the Conservative Party was the most popular party for this age group (likely down to the SDP’s spoiler effect). Despite this, the Conservatives won the last general election with a landslide, notwithstanding a 43 per cent lead for a youth-oriented Labour campaign amongst 18–24-year-olds. Their historical success vindicates an enduring rule of thumb — voters become more conservative with age."

"Is it inevitable that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for US president for a third race in a row?

And this time, Trump is also managing a slew of criminal and civil charges – yet remains the frontrunner for the nomination. Why does Trump still have such strong support?"

On Saturday, outside of Chicago, a 6-year-old boy was stabbed to death in an anti-Muslim hate crime. Threats of domestic terrorism are mounting.

"Their politics and personalities may differ, but the four members of Maine’s congressional delegation favor order over chaos and recognize that governing means compromise. Right now, that’s not happening, and U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and U.S. Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden are all increasingly frustrated about it. In interviews with each of them last week – a week that featured the historic ouster of Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on the heels of a near-shutdown of the federal government – Maine’s members of Congress reflected on recent events, the decaying political climate in Washington, what it could take to improve things and whether that’s even possible with the next election cycle already upon us."
""""""" Authored by David Henderson and Charles Hooper via The Brownstone Institute , The COVID-19 pandemic brought us a panoply of lies and evidence-light declarations that were less intended to inform Americans than to consolidate power and buy time . Among these were Anthony Fauci ’ s famous shift from arguing against wearing masks , to recommending wearing one , and , finally , to wearing two . Fauci also tried to convince us that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not manipulated in a lab even though his inner circle had emailed him about “ unusual features ” of the virus that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , we had “ fifteen days to stop the spread , ” an evergreen concept that dragged on for two years . Lest readers fault us for forgetting , there was also the “ gain of function ” controversy , the focused protection battle , school closures , lockdowns , vaccine mandates , and vaccine misrepresentations . These topics have received much public attention . The one pandemic topic that hasn ’ t , and is nonetheless important , is the maligned ivermectin . It ’ s time to set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the news closely over the last two years , you ’ ve probably heard a few things about ivermectin . • None First , that it ’ s a veterinary medicine intended for horses and cows . • None Second , that the FDA and other government regulatory agencies recommended against its use for COVID-19 . • None Third , that even the inventor and manufacturer of ivermectin , Merck & Co. , came out against it . • None Fourth , that one of the largest studies showing that ivermectin worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . • None And , finally , that the largest and best study of ivermectin , the TOGETHER trial , showed that ivermectin didn ’ t work . Ivermectin has a distinguished history , and it may have benefits comparable to those of penicillin .

The FDA ’ s warning , which included language such as , “ serious harm , ” “ hospitalized , ” “ dangerous , ” “ very dangerous , ” “ seizures , ” “ coma and even death , ” and “ highly toxic , ” might suggest that the FDA was warning against pills laced with poison , not a drug the FDA had already approved as safe . Why did it become dangerous when used for COVID-19 ? The FDA didn ’ t say . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were to make any statement on ivermectin , it was obliged to attack it . The FDA prohibits the promotion of drugs for unapproved uses . Since fighting SARS-CoV-2 was an unapproved use of ivermectin , the FDA couldn ’ t have advocated use without obvious hypocrisy .

We have calculated that the probability that ivermectin helped the patients in the TOGETHER trial ranged from 26 percent for the median number of days to clinical recovery to 91 percent for preventing hospitalization .

""""""" Authored by John and Nisha Whitehead via The Rutherford Institute , It ’ s easy to become discouraged about the state of our nation . We ’ re drowning under the weight of too much debt , too many wars , too much power in the hands of a centralized government , too many militarized police , too many laws , too many lobbyists , and generally too much bad news . It ’ s harder to believe that change is possible , that the system can be reformed , that politicians can be principled , that courts can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that freedom will prevail . So where does that leave us ? Benjamin Franklin provided the answer . As the delegates to the Constitutional Convention trudged out of Independence Hall on September 17 , 1787 , an anxious woman in the crowd waiting at the entrance inquired of Franklin , “ Well , Doctor , what have we got , a republic or a monarchy ? ” “ A republic , ” Franklin replied , “ if you can keep it. ” What Franklin meant , of course , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get the government we deserve . Those who gave us the Constitution and the Bill of Rights believed that the government exists at the behest of its citizens . It is there to protect , defend and even enhance our freedoms , not violate them . Unfortunately , although the Bill of Rights was adopted as a means of protecting the people against government tyranny , in America today , the government does whatever it wants , freedom be damned . “ We the people ” have been terrorized , traumatized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliance by a government that cares nothing for our lives or our liberties . The bogeyman ’ s names and faces have changed over time ( terrorism , the war on drugs , illegal immigration , a viral pandemic , and more to come ) , but the end result remains the same : in the so-called name of national security , the Constitution has been steadily chipped away at , undermined , eroded , whittled down , and generally discarded with the support of Congress , the White House , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rights—set against a backdrop of government surveillance , militarized police , SWAT team raids , asset forfeiture , eminent domain , overcriminalization , armed surveillance drones , whole body scanners , stop and frisk searches , vaccine mandates , lockdowns , and the like ( all sanctioned by Congress , the White House , and the courts ) —would understandably sound more like a eulogy to freedoms lost than an affirmation of rights we truly possess . What we are left with today is but a shadow of the robust document adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of the damage has been inflicted upon the Bill of Rights . Here is what it means to live under the Constitution , twenty-plus years after 9/11 and with the nation just emerging from two years of COVID-19 lockdowns and mandates . The First Amendment is supposed to protect the freedom to speak your mind , assemble and protest nonviolently without being bridled by the government . It also protects the freedom of the media , as well as the right to worship and pray without interference . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government . To the founders , all of America was a free speech zone . Despite the clear protections found in the First Amendment , the freedoms described therein are under constant assault . Increasingly , Americans are being persecuted for exercising their First Amendment rights and speaking out against government corruption . Activists are being arrested and charged for daring to film police officers engaged in harassment or abusive practices . Journalists are being prosecuted for reporting on whistleblowers . States are passing legislation to muzzle reporting on cruel and abusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fined for attempting to feed and house the homeless . Protesters are being tear-gassed , beaten , arrested and forced into “ free speech zones. ” And under the guise of “ government speech , ” the courts have reasoned that the government can discriminate freely against any First Amendment activity that takes place within a so-called government forum . The Second Amendment was intended to guarantee “ the right of the people to keep and bear arms. ” Essentially , this amendment was intended to give the citizenry the means to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court as an individual citizen right , Americans remain powerless to defend themselves against red flag gun laws , militarized police , SWAT team raids , and government agencies armed to the teeth with military weapons better suited to the battlefield . The Third Amendment reinforces the principle that civilian-elected officials are superior to the military by prohibiting the military from entering any citizen ’ s home without “ the consent of the owner. ” With the police increasingly training like the military , acting like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces—complete with heavily armed SWAT teams , military weapons , assault vehicles , etc.—it is clear that we now have what the founders feared most—a standing army on American soil . The Fourth Amendment prohibits government agents from conducting surveillance on you or touching you or encroaching on your private property unless they have evidence that you ’ re up to something criminal . In other words , the Fourth Amendment ensures privacy and bodily integrity . Unfortunately , the Fourth Amendment has suffered the greatest damage in recent years and has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governmental police powers that include strip searches and even anal and vaginal searches of citizens , surveillance ( corporate and otherwise ) , and intrusions justified in the name of fighting terrorism , as well as the outsourcing of otherwise illegal activities to private contractors . The Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment work in tandem . These amendments supposedly ensure that you are innocent until proven guilty , and government authorities can not deprive you of your life , your liberty or your property without the right to an attorney and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , in the new suspect society in which we live , where surveillance is the norm , these fundamental principles have been upended . Certainly , if the government can arbitrarily freeze , seize or lay claim to your property ( money , land or possessions ) under government asset forfeiture schemes , you have no true rights . The Seventh Amendment guarantees citizens the right to a jury trial . Yet when the populace has no idea of what ’ s in the Constitution—civic education has virtually disappeared from most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury incapable of distinguishing justice and the law from their own preconceived notions and fears . However , as a growing number of citizens are coming to realize , the power of the jury to nullify the government ’ s actions—and thereby help balance the scales of justice—is not to be underestimated . Jury nullification reminds the government that “ we the people ” retain the power to ultimately determine what laws are just . The Eighth Amendment is similar to the Sixth in that it is supposed to protect the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel and unusual punishment . However , the Supreme Court ’ s determination that what constitutes “ cruel and unusual ” should be dependent on the “ evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society ” leaves us with little protection in the face of a society lacking in morals altogether . The Ninth Amendment provides that other rights not enumerated in the Constitution are nonetheless retained by the people . Popular sovereignty—the belief that the power to govern flows upward from the people rather than downward from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , it has since been turned on its head by a centralized federal government that sees itself as supreme and which continues to pass more and more laws that restrict our freedoms under the pretext that it has an “ important government interest ” in doing so . As for the Tenth Amendment ’ s reminder that the people and the states retain every authority that is not otherwise mentioned in the Constitution , that assurance of a system of government in which power is divided among local , state and national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the centralized Washington , DC , power elite—the president , Congress and the courts . Thus , if there is any sense to be made from this recitation of freedoms lost , it is simply this : our individual freedoms have been eviscerated so that the government ’ s powers could be expanded . It was no idle happenstance that the Constitution opens with these three powerful words : “ We the people. ” As the Preamble proclaims : In other words , it ’ s our job to make the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are supposed to be the masters and they—the government and its agents—are the servants . We the American people—the citizenry—are supposed to be the arbiters and ultimate guardians of America ’ s welfare , defense , liberty , laws and prosperity . Still , it ’ s hard to be a good citizen if you don ’ t know anything about your rights or how the government is supposed to operate . As the National Review rightly asks , “ How can Americans possibly make intelligent and informed political choices if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of their government ? American citizens have the right to self-government , but it seems that we increasingly lack the capacity for it. ” Most citizens have little , if any , knowledge about their basic rights . And our educational system does a poor job of teaching the basic freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights . For instance , a survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center found that a little more than one-third of respondents ( 36 percent ) could name all three branches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 percent ) could not name a single one . A survey by the McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum found that only one out of a thousand adults could identify the five rights protected by the First Amendment . On the other hand , more than half ( 52 % ) of the respondents could name at least two of the characters in the animated Simpsons television family , and 20 % could name all five . And although half could name none of the freedoms in the First Amendment , a majority ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the three judges on the TV program American Idol , 41 % could name two and one-fourth could name all three . Many who responded to the survey had a strange conception of what was in the First Amendment . For example , a startling number of respondents believed that the “ right to own a pet ” and the “ right to drive a car ” were part of the First Amendment . Another 38 % believed that “ taking the Fifth ” was part of the First Amendment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better . A study conducted by the Center for Survey Research and Analysis found that one educator in five was unable to name any of the freedoms in the First Amendment . Government leaders and politicians are also ill-informed . Although they take an oath to uphold , support and defend the Constitution against “ enemies foreign and domestic , ” their lack of education about our fundamental rights often causes them to be enemies of the Bill of Rights . Thomas Jefferson recognized that a citizenry educated on “ their rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only real assurance that freedom will survive . As Jefferson wrote in 1820 : “ I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of our society but the people themselves ; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion , the remedy is not to take it from them , but to inform their discretion by education . This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power. ” From the President on down , anyone taking public office should have a working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rights and should be held accountable for upholding their precepts . One way to ensure this would be to require government leaders to take a course on the Constitution and pass a thorough examination thereof before being allowed to take office . Some critics are advocating that students pass the United States citizenship exam in order to graduate from high school . Others recommend that it must be a prerequisite for attending college . I ’ d go so far as to argue that students should have to pass the citizenship exam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s an idea to get educated and take a stand for freedom : anyone who signs up to become a member of The Rutherford Institute gets a wallet-sized Bill of Rights card and a Know Your Rights card . Use this card to teach your children the freedoms found in the Bill of Rights . A healthy , representative government is hard work . It takes a citizenry that is informed about the issues , educated about how the government operates , and willing to do more than grouse and complain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battlefield America : The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries , “ we the people ” have the power to make and break the government . The powers-that-be want us to remain divided over politics , hostile to those with whom we disagree politically , and intolerant of anyone or anything whose solutions to what ails this country differ from our own . They also want us to believe that our job as citizens begins and ends on Election Day . Yet there are 330 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagine what we could accomplish if we actually worked together , presented a united front , and spoke with one voice . """""""

"Reading Time: 5 minutes By now, it’s almost a law of nature: In Latin America incumbents, and their parties, don’t win reelection. Incumbent parties have won just five of 31 presidential elections across the region since 2015, excluding the unfree and unfair votes held in Venezuela and Nicaragua. Now, the anti-incumbency wave is coming for the left. Since 2019, leftist parties and presidents have won office practically everywhere, generating buzz about a regional pink tide. But centrist and right-wing candidates are polling ahead in the run up to Ecuador’s and Argentina’s October elections.

""""""" ( Natural News ) When conventional farmers want to carpet bomb a crop field with insecticides to kill the insects , they spray the field with toxic chemicals . The chemicals are absorbed by the insects and go to work destroying their nervous systems or circulatory systems . Before long , millions of insects experience a “ died suddenly ” event . When globalists want to kill off masses of humans living in high population density cities , they can similarly carpet bomb the city with aerosolized “ vaccines ” that are designed to be inhaled . These can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way malathion was sprayed on populations , presumably to control mosquitoes and the over-hyped Zika virus . A recent article from Eugyppius : A Plague Chronicle reveals that Bill Gates-associated researchers are now pushing for covid nasal vaccines that could theoretically be sprayed on populations and inhaled without individual knowledge or consent . take our poll - story continues below “ Virus moron Eric Topol and snakeoil saleswoman Akiko Iwasaki plug mRNA nasal spray hocus pocus , demand a second Operation Warp Speed to further tinker with billions of human immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oligarchic support for nasal spray vaccines proceeds primarily from the beleaguered mind of Bill Gates , who is quietly disappointed in the performance of the mRNA elixirs and now places the better part of his hope in masking… Topol is just a mentally vacant Corona brigadier , but Iwasaki is co-founder of the pharmaceutical startup RIGImmune , which has received two million dollars from the Gates Foundation “ to develop novel innate immune activators to protect against infectious diseases that disproportionately impact the developing world. ” She ’ s also co-founded Xanadu Bio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nanoparticles that won ’ t kill you when you inhale them… If this effort succeeds , it would give globalists a way to air drop mRNA instructions on entire populations in exactly the same way farmers spray fields with insecticides . The mRNA instructions hijack the body ’ s cells , programming them to construct non-human protein structures which can also function as biological weapons that cause infertility or clots . As Natural News has exclusively documented with laboratory tests , these clots are self-assembling biostructures that grow in size until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim . People are dropping dead just like weevils , and the “ human herd ” is being culled like never before . Human populations are seen as “ plagues ” by the globalists Human populations are seen by globalists as plagues upon the planet , worthy of extermination in the same way an infestation of cockroaches might be handled . According to globalists , human beings are not only using too many precious resources — such as water , energy and land — they ’ re also polluting the oceans with plastics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the future of human civilization . Therefore , they must be exterminated , the thinking goes . The real trick is figuring out how to convince the masses they aren ’ t being exterminated as they line up for extermination injections . To achieve this , “ vaccines ” were pushed by doctors , journalists , government authorities , Big Tech , employers and schools , in contradiction to any real supporting science . These death shots were called “ safe and effective ” when they were really dangerous and deadly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ authority ” influencers will likely pay for that bad decision with their lives , it turns out . Because all along , the covid-19 pandemic was a ploy to get people to line up and agree to be injected with slow-acting euthanasia shots . Now , the post-vaccine clots are continuing to grow in size , clogging arteries and blood vessels , causing an increasing number of people to drop dead without any ready explanation that the medical establishment will accept . The common cause among all these “ died suddenly ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clots that are clogging up arteries and blood vessels . Importantly , these clots are continuing to grow in size every day , inside the bodies of the people who took the vaccines . Millions more will die in the months and years to come .

Governments , medical establishments , universities and the media have violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of the code ’ s 10 points . They have coerced people into being human guinea pigs . Those who have intentionally , knowingly and maliciously violated the principles of the Nuremberg Code must be punished .

According to Doctor Leland Stillman , the reason is more political than scientific , because otherwise there would be no basis for lockdowns or vaccine mandates . “ If ivermectin were recognized by the public health and academic establishment as the drug that it is , that treats acute viral illnesses , one of which is COVID-19 , the entire justification for lockdowns , mandates , let alone vaccine research and development would evaporate overnight , ” Stillman told The Epoch Times in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act ( pdf ) , the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) can only issue emergency use authorization if certain criteria are met , including “ there is no adequate , approved , and available alternative to the product. ” So if there ’ s an approved alternative , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) —an agency in HHS—can ’ t issue emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccines . Stillman said it ’ s not a conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivermectin works for treating COVID-19 , because tens of thousands of physicians all over the world have recognized its effectiveness . The Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance ( FLCCC ) , a nonprofit organization working on protocols to treat patients with COVID-19 , regards ivermectin as a core medication used in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 . Its website cites 142 studies , among which 93 are peer-reviewed , and 75 with results comparing treatment and control groups showing ivermectin works . However , the FDA has repeatedly said that “ currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective against COVID-19. ” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) directed The Epoch Times to contact the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) for COVID-19 treatments . NIH referred to their online guidelines about ivermectin : “ There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 . Results from adequately powered , well-designed , and well-conducted clinical trials are needed to provide more specific , evidence-based guidance on the role of ivermectin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained why many doctors are silent on recognizing ivermectin as an effective drug for COVID-19 , a disease caused by the CCP ( Chinese Communist Party ) virus . “ And the reality that ’ s really important for people to understand is that doctors can lose their licenses or lose their board certification , which is very important for their income based on insurance guidelines , for speaking out as I have chosen to , ” Stillman said . Stillman said he is able to speak up because he ’ s one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who takes cash and doesn ’ t work with insurance companies . Graduated from University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville , Virginia , Stillman is now practicing medicine in Kissimmee , Florida . His focus is to help people achieve health with integrative medicine , which combines a number of different modalities , such as traditional Chinese medicine , herbs , nutrition , diet , exercise , and lifestyle changes . Two prominent scientists , Martin Kulldorff , previously a professor at Harvard Medical School , and Jay Bhattacharya , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also explained why many scientists are silent on this issue as well . In an article published in The Epoch Times last month , the two professors said NIH and its National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , which is headed by Anthony Fauci , control a scientific research budget of billions of dollars every year , and “ channel research dollars to nearly every infectious disease epidemiologist , immunologist , and virologist of note in the United States and UK. ” So it would be unwise for scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There ’ s a lot of politics on this , ” Stillman said , referring to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate . “ And the way it ’ s been politicized is really disgraceful and unfortunate . At the end of the day , it ’ s all about how these corporations who are profiting immensely off of the pandemic. ” Stillman said freedom is the way out of the current problem . “ Freedom is absolutely the solution , ” Stillman said . “ Because if you really allow doctors to treat patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , without all this , it can be very affordable , and it can be very effective . “ Because the reality is that a lot of the care being provisioned right now , it ’ s just being provisioned based on some bureaucrat ’ s idea of what ’ s good medicine , not based on what the patients actually want and think is worth it to them . ” """""""

What is now happening in Ukraine has serious geopolitical implications . It could lead us into a World War III scenario . It is important that a peace process be initiated with a view to preventing escalation . “ No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must know that Russia will respond immediately , and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history… . I hope that my words will be heard. ” Vladimir Putin issues warning to any country that tries to stop Russia ’ s “ Special Operation ” in Ukraine​ In a move that can only be regarded as a major escalation , NATO officials announced on Friday that they would deploy troops from its Combat-Ready Response Force to support the Ukrainian regime in its war with Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will be used to blunt the Russian offensive that has already seized large parts of the country and obliterated most of Ukraine ’ s defensive capability . It is impossible to overstate the gravity of NATO ’ s action which assigns such importance to preserving its ‘ junta regime ’ in Kiev that they would willingly pit NATO against a nuclear-armed Russia in what could become a much broader regional war . Clearly , the strategic objectives of this murky conflict go far beyond the mere control of an ethnically-divided , failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine is no longer just a geopolitical trophy for western elites , but a last-gasp effort for Washington to prove it still controls the levers of global power . Here ’ s the story from Reuters : “ NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday the alliance was deploying parts of its combat-ready response force and would continue to send weapons to Ukraine , including air defences , while saying that Russia was trying to topple the Ukrainian government . “ We see rhetoric , the messages , which is strongly indicating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected government in Kyiv , ” he told a news conference following a virtual meeting of NATO leaders . ( “ NATO allies to provide more weapons to Ukraine , Stoltenberg says ” , Reuters ) Stoltenberg ’ s decision gives Russian president Vladimir Putin no choice but to locate and destroy whatever weapons or troops enter the country that could be used to kill or injure Russian servicemen . Naturally , the killing of NATO personnel could be used to further escalate the conflict plunging the region into a much wider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more from Stoltenberg ’ s press conference on Friday : “ Yesterday , NATO Allies activated our defense plans… on land , at sea , and in the air… . The United States , Canada and European Allies have deployed thousands more troops to the eastern part of the Alliance… We now have over 100 jets at high alert operating in over 30 different locations… and over 120 ships from the High North to the Mediterranean… including three strike carrier groups… . We have many planes operating in the eastern part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly already assigned troops and forces to the NATO Response Force. ” Weapon support also includes “ air defence systems… ” ( which could be used to enforce a no-fly zone . ) This is the most serious security crisis we have faced in Europe for decades… ... . It is about how Russia is actually challenging core values for security , and demanding that NATO should withdraw all forces and infrastructure from almost half of our members . And they have stated that if we don ’ t meet their demands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , we have to take this seriously . And that ’ s exactly why we are now deploying the NATO Response Force , for the first time in a collective defence context. ” ( NATO ’ s Virtual Summit , Feb 25 , 2022 ) Stoltenberg is right , Russia is challenging NATO ’ s core values on security , and demanding that Alliance roll back its forces and infrastructure from Russia ’ s doorstep . What Stoltenberg fails to mention is that NATO expansion poses an existential threat to Russia by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat troops on its border . He also fails to mention that NATO expansion violates agreements ( to which all of the NATO members are signatores ) stipulating that all parties to the agreement will refrain from any action that could affect the security interests of the other members . In Istanbul ( 1999 ) and in Astana ( 2010 ) , the US and the other 56 countries in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) signed documents “ that contained interrelated principles to ensure the indivisibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , is that nations can not put military bases and missile sites in locations that pose a threat to other members . It means that parties must refrain from using their respective territories to carry out or assist armed aggression against other members . It means that parties are prohibited from acting in a manner that runs counter to the principles laid out in the treaty . It means that Ukraine can not become a member of NATO if its membership poses a threat to Russian security . So , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to security , mainly because NATO ’ s approach is built on the rubble of treaties that the member states already signed and approved but now refuse to honor because it doesn ’ t advance their geopolitical objectives . Stoltenberg would like us all to believe that joining NATO should simply be a matter of personal choice ( “ Every nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements ” ) like choosing which flavor of ice cream one wants to eat . But that is not how leaders protect their countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be mitigated when other nations agree that they “ will NOT strengthen their own security at the expense of the security of others. ” That ’ s the bottom line and that is never going to change . National security is every leader ’ s highest priority and it always will be . Stoltenberg rejects this fundamental tenet of global security , and his rejection has paved the way to war . If you want to know who ’ s responsible for the war in Ukraine : Blame NATO . Here ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Over the past 30 years we have been patiently trying to come to an agreement with the leading NATO countries regarding the principles of equal and indivisible security in Europe . In response to our proposals , we invariably faced either cynical deception and lies or attempts at pressure and blackmail , while the North Atlantic alliance continued to expand despite our protests and concerns . Its military machine is moving and , as I said , is approaching our very border . Why is this happening ? Where did this insolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their exceptionalism , infallibility and all-permissiveness come from ? What is the explanation for this contemptuous and disdainful attitude to our interests and absolutely legitimate demands ? ” “ For the United States and its allies , it is a policy of containing Russia , with obvious geopolitical dividends . For our country , it is a matter of life and death , a matter of our historical future as a nation . This is not an exaggeration ; this is a fact . It is not only a very real threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of our state and to its sovereignty . It is the red line which we have spoken about on numerous occasions . They have crossed it. ” ( “ Address by the President of the Russian Federation “ , Kremlin , RU ) It ’ s worth noting , that Stoltenberg has been chosen to become Norway ’ s next Central Bank chief which illustrates the cozy relationship between the Big Money and the geopolitical machinations that invariably end in war . We can only wonder whether this risky gambit in Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western financial system that is so thoroughly-marinated in corruption that its markets require monthly infusions of billions of dollars in digital cash to prevent a system-wide meltdown followed by a precipitous decline in the value of the dollar . By keeping Russia down , Stoltenberg ’ s backers might be hoping they can breathe new life into the rotting corpse of the imperial system . But whatever the reason may be , the deploying of NATO Combat-Ready Response Force greatly increases the chances of a miscalculation that could lead to disaster . Check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Ulrich Kühn who points out the risks of current strategy : “ President Biden and other Western leaders have made it clear repeatedly that they would not send forces to Ukraine . ….That does not mean , however , that unintended actions by Russia… or by individual NATO member states could not spark a larger conflict that no one planned . During the next hours , days , and weeks , the risk of what strategists call “ inadvertent escalation ” will increase… . Another possible scenario for inadvertent escalation is linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A day before the Russian assault , British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced , “ the UK will shortly be providing a further package of military support to Ukraine . This will include lethal aid in the form of defensive weapons and non-lethal aid. ” As morally justified such calls might sound in the current environment , the question remains : How will weapons be transferred to Ukraine , now that Russia has established air dominance over the country ? They would almost certainly not be flown in but would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would thus be in the interest of the Russian military to gain quick control over Ukraine ’ s western borders with NATO allies . Possible efforts by individual NATO member states to send additional military equipment via the Ukrainian land borders could be met with fierce Russian resistance and may lead to skirmishes between Russian and NATO personnel. ” ( The pathways of inadvertent escalation : Is a NATO-Russia war ( now ) possible ? ” Bulletin of Atomic Scientists ) So , what does this excerpt tell us ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already “ gamed-out ” the developments we now see unfolding . NATO would like to lure Putin into attacking their supply-lines , so the action could be used to justify greater involvement in the conflict . In other words , what we ’ re seeing is a calculated effort to ( incrementally ) increase the probability of a war between Russia and NATO . There ’ s nothing that would please Uncle Sam more than to see Russia bogged down in bloody quagmire that further isolates Moscow from Europe and prevents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continents together into the world ’ s largest free trade zone . Washington wants to avoid that scenario at all cost . Check out this quote from Russian economist Sergie Glaziev : “ To maintain their world dominance , the ( US ) is provoking another war in Europe . A war is always good for America.They even call the Second World War which killed 50 million people in Europe and Russia , a good war . It was good for America because the US emerged from this war as the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War which ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union was also good for them . Now the US again wants to maintain its leadership at the expense of Europe . US leadership is being threatened by a rapidly rising China . The world today is shifting to yet another cycle , this time political . This cycle lasts centuries and is associated with the global institutions of regulatory economics . We are now moving from the American cycle of capital accumulation to an Asian cycle . This is another crisis that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading position in the face of competition with a rising China and other Asian countries Americans are starting a war in Europe . They want to weaken Europe , break up Russia , and subjugate the entire Eurasian continent . That is , instead of a development zone from Lisbon to Vladivostok , which is proposed by President Putin , the US wants to start a chaotic war on this territory , embroil all Europe in a war , devalue to European capital , write off its public debt , under the burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart , write off what they owe to Europe and Russia , subjugate our economic space and establish control over resources of the giant Eurasian continent . They believe that this is the only way they can maintain their hegemony and beat China… . Russia and Ukraine are the victims of this war which is being fomented by the Americans . But Europe is also a victim because the war aims to target European welfare and to destabilize Europe . Americans expect the European capital and brain drain to America will continue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of Europe on fire . It ’ s very strange that European leaders are going along with them. ” ( Watch this extraordinary 2014 Interview with Russian intellectual Sergei Glaziev that was posted at The Saker website nearly 10 years ago ) The deployment of NATO ’ s Combat-Ready Response Force provides more evidence that the Alliance is an aggressive and war-mongering​ organization which undermines European security and puts the entire world at risk . As America ’ s cat ’ s-paw on the continent , NATO invariably acts in Washington ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we should expect to see a steady intensification of hostilities directed at Russia , all of which are designed to further divide the continents while tightening Washington ’ s grip on power . NATO troops will not operate within Ukraine but exclusively in NATO member states . This was not clear from NATO ’ s original communique . The question remains , however , is the providing of heavy weapons an act of war ? In my opinion , it would be quite easy for NATO to end the fighting by simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementing the Minsk​ Protocol , and abandoning all plans to deploy nuclear missiles to Poland and Romania . Putin ’ s only demand is that NATO seriously address Russia ’ s legitimate security concerns . Note to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .

""""""" His decision to get involved was emblematic of a Republican Party that ’ s divided over how much to edge away from hardline positions on social issues as it tries to rebuild credibility with swing voters after a disappointing midterm performance . As much as some Republicans hope to counterbalance the chaos of the Trump years and a conservative Supreme Court majority ’ s reversal of Roe v. Wade , same-sex marriage still plainly splits the GOP : Tillis , Collins , and Portman joined just nine other Republican senators to ultimately support the bill . Tillis said that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him so out front on same-sex marriage way back in July : “ That ’ s probably the libertarian side of me. ” Tweaking the bill to allow more religious freedom exemptions , he added , helped Republicans deliver a stronger message to voters “ that this is not about an extreme liberal , progressive end that would destroy religious freedom in this country. ” “ This was about settling something that is on the minds of millions of people and their families , ” Tillis said . “ And I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolutions develop over decades , then accelerate in an instant . That ’ s how it happened for Democrats , who were divided over same-sex marriage during former President Barack Obama ’ s first term until then-Vice President Joe Biden announced his support 10 years ago . Obama followed , and the rest of the party was not far behind . It ’ s been a slower trickle for Republicans . Portman , Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R-Alaska ) were on a fairly lonely island in favor of same-sex marriage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2016 , former Rep. Richard Hanna ( R-N.Y. ) — another early supporter — castigated his party for being too intolerant on the issue . This summer , 47 House Republicans ’ surprising support for the same-sex marriage bill spurred a sustained push from Tillis , Portman and Collins to take action — a veritable GOP tidal shift . As former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R-Miss . ) put it on Tuesday : “ Times change . And senators change. ” “ I do feel that the young populations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to same-sex marriage . And I think this is something that in years to come is not going to be an issue . It shouldn ’ t be , ” said Sen. Joni Ernst ( R-Iowa ) , whose state was one of the first in the country to legalize same-sex marriage . Ernst and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito ( R-W.Va. ) are the highest-ranking Senate Republicans to support the legislation as they prepare to ascend to Nos . 4 and 5 in GOP leadership next year . Two House Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tom Emmer of Minnesota , supported a previous version of the legislation . The Senate ’ s amended bill now goes back to the House , where it ’ s assured of final passage but the ultimate number of GOP supporters is in flux . The bill ’ s Senate GOP backers are a motley group , including moderates like Collins and Murkowski but also Sen. Cynthia Lummis ( R-Wyo . ) , who objected to President Joe Biden ’ s election certification and routinely votes against bipartisan bills . Retiring Sens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy Blunt ( R-Mo . ) backed the effort , but fellow retiring Sens . Pat Toomey ( R-Pa. ) and Richard Shelby ( R-Ala. ) rejected it . Dealmaking Sen. Mitt Romney ( R-Utah ) joined Tillis , as did Dan Sullivan ( R-Alaska ) .

By mid-November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R-Ind . ) was on board , too . The square-jawed Marine veteran said he had to do his homework before he came around to the legislation : “ I ’ m a skeptical person. ” But he also saw an opportunity to both protect same-sex marriage rights if the Supreme Court ever revisited its 2015 Obergefell decision and simultaneously ensure that every state “ would not be required to sanctify same-sex marriages in the future. ” “ We ’ re all doing the best we can to get it right . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve gotten it right , ” Young said . LGBTQ advocates chafe at the fact that the bill does not truly codify a national right to same-sex marriage , instead repealing the Defense of Marriage Act and requiring all states to recognize marriages performed in other states should the high court reverse its earlier ruling . Supportive Republicans may not have gone further than they did , and the bill only squeaked by Tuesday , 61-36 . Ernst said that she ’ s evolved on the issue and believes “ in traditional marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of our population feels very differently on the issue. ” Other Republicans indicated the ultimate legislation achieved a balance in what they could support . “ I think marriage is between one man and one woman . Other people have a different point of view and people have relied upon Obergefell to make their life decisions . I don ’ t think you go back and unwind marriages that have been performed legally by various states , ” Romney said . Though Republicans privately estimate perhaps 30 or so of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative backlash limited the whip count . Sinema has cut deals on infrastructure and gun safety but said that “ the attempts to derail this piece of legislation were probably more focused and robust than any other bills I ’ ve worked on in the last two years. ” “ Real credit needs to be given to the 12 Republicans who are standing with conviction on this piece of legislation to protect religious liberties and to give peace of mind to families all across this country . Because the opposition was very , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When explaining her vote on the floor on Tuesday , Lummis alluded to a mountain of criticism back home , saying the days since she first signaled support for the bill “ have been fairly brutal self soul-searching . Entirely avoidable , I might add , had I simply chosen to vote no. ” Taking flak for stepping into the bipartisan breach was nothing new for Tillis , even before his summertime work with Sinema and others on gun safety . He ’ d felt it when he sought to protect then-Special Counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former President Donald Trump . After initially opposing Trump ’ s border wall national emergency , Tillis reversed himself on it as he sought reelection . So as this Congress ends with another surprising Senate deal on the books , Tillis offered some advice : “ Any time you do any bipartisan effort , you ’ re gon na get a little heat in either direction .

"Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz France and Germany have hatched up a plan that they hope will tempt the UK to rejoin the European Union - at least as an “associate member”. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz want to see an “inner-circle” of countries bound together by ever-closer rules covering areas like EU budgets, tax and even defence, security and foreign policy. An “outer-circle” would be based on the single market. It would not be bound by the Brussels bureaucrats’ dream of ever-closer union, but it would be based on free movement and open-doors immigration policies. They hope this will provide a home for existing EU members such as Hungary or Poland which are losing patience with Brussels, and nations like Norway and Switzerland that never wanted to join in the first place. The French and Germans have also floated the idea of Britain signing up. I suppose there might have been a chance, if the EU had offered David Cameron the “associate membership” they started talking about this week before the referendum, that the UK might have voted to remain back in 2016.

"Since his retirement from front-line politics, Tony Blair has become in the eyes of the status quo, the sensible voice in the deafening noise of populism. Like few ex-prime ministers before him, he still wields a high degree of soft power through his charity ‘The Tony Blair Institute’. After a recent interview with Andrew Marr (New Statesmen, 26th July), where he revealed to play down the importance of tackling climate change and his worrying view that there should be greater alignment between AI and personal data; it raises the question, just how sensible a voice is Tony Blairs? And is it his voice or someone else’s? Tony Blair has become the self-anointed king of the centre of politics. His words are still held in esteem with mainstream media and politicians. Any leader or party who veers from this perceived centre is labelled as ‘populist’ or ‘extreme’, and his policies are described as ‘progressive’ and ‘modernising’. They are words that have a subtle but powerful effect to the listeners’ interpretation of the left and centre. The Left is seen as in the past and the centre is the future, but why should this be the case? There is no obvious reason why free market capitalism should be seen as progressive, especially when the disastrous effects of inequality are being felt as a consequence. It seems to be another tool to keep the status quo as it is, for those it is working for, the richest in society. Blair’s idea of the centre is that of a politics that is objective, unchanging and always the ideal. He cares little for changing landscapes (apart from AI which he champions even though it is likely to worsen inequality), and still sees the centre of politics as the same as it was in the 1990’s. Owen Jones in his book ‘The Establishment’, shows how through history, the centre of politics has always shifted, evolving with the times. The conservative governments of the 1940s and 1950s, would now be described as Marxist, with nationalisation of industries commonplace, and unquestioned from both parties. The centre should change with the times, if it doesn’t evolve the country will stagnate. Blair still ignores the detrimental effects of globalisation on parts of society and seems to care more for grand global ideas, than the real needs that are being urged for in society."

""""""" There is a chance , albeit very slim , that tonight could be the beginning of the Canadian “ La Resistance ” in the Canadian Parliament to end the authoritarian itch that Justin Trudeau has been scratching really hard the past week . You may think that this analogy is a bit gross but when compared to how Trudeau has unleashed the power of the Canadian government on its citizens , it ’ s quite fitting . Here at RedState , we have been covering this story since the very beginning with a mix of admiration and zeal . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are different in many ways . One of those ways is just how gosh darn peaceful these protestors have been for over three weeks — no Target has been looted even once . The other major difference is how the Canadians have turned the other cheek as the Trudeau forces have smacked them for peacefully holding up signs asking to remove the mandates . Americans are not fond of getting hit and smiling about it . Now , I ’ m not throwing shade at our cousins to the north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada was founded around the time that we were telling the King of England to stick it in his ear and those who left the colonies were cool with King George . They have always had a higher boiling point than we Yankees have . We tend to boil pretty fast about political stuff here in the states . My colleague Nick Arama has covered this story quite extensively and yesterday wrote this — Crackdown Sparks Even More Massive Protests Across Canada , Crisis for Trudeau — about the protestors ’ spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blockades which Trudeau claimed as an excuse , ended peacefully without the use of the Act . Meanwhile , the government has moved on to seizing all kinds of power including conscription of tow truck drivers and seizing bank accounts of people for the “ crime ” of political opinion . As we noted earlier , the police chief even said they would continue to hunt the protesters — and their finances- down , even after the protests . Trudeau made it clear that part of this — from the very beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views ” and that he was cool with kneeling with BLM protesters — just not these guys about whom he has lied so much . Trudeau has made it clear he feels totally justified in granting himself these powers and tonight , the House of Commons in Canada will vote to either rubber stamp this action or deny him the opportunity to continue to use them . One of Canada ’ s liberty watchdogs groups just came out this morning asking that the members of Parliament reject giving Trudeau the yes votes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that statement released by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association , they make it clear they are not fans of this ill-advised maneuver by Hair Gel Trudeau . From that press release… The Canadian Civil Liberties Association ( CCLA ) is calling on the federal government to revoke the declaration of emergency . If the government fails to do so , a vote is scheduled to take place on Monday evening at 8 PM , and CCLA calls on all parties to vote against the motion , or at a minimum permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own personal conscience . “ The government ’ s own proclamation of emergency was clear : they claimed that they needed to invoke the extraordinary Emergencies Act to deal with the blockades . Those blockades are now dismantled . The sweeping national emergency powers they enacted should be dismantled as well , ” said Noa Mendelsohn Aviv , Executive Director and General Counsel of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association . “ Whether the Emergencies Act should have been invoked in the first place is a fundamentally important question that will continued to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the courts . The question that is relevant to parliamentarians today , however , is not whether the government was justified in issuing a proclamation of emergency a week ago . It is whether that proclamation continues to be justified today . The clear answer , in our view , is no. ” “ At this time , the proper course of action for the government is to revoke the declaration of emergency . If they fail to do so , members of parliament will be required to attend a vote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergency proclamation should stand . We would urge them to vote against the proclamation and are asking all parties to allow a free vote so that every elected representative is able to vote their conscience. ” Here is a little bit of background here about what is in the press release that is a bit clever . Trudeau does NOT have a majority of seats in the House right now . According to Wiki , the Liberal Party has 160 seats but needs 170 to have an outright majority . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties to get to the 170 seats to remain Prime Minister in the last election that just occurred last September . While it is fully expected that the motion to approve what Trudeau has done will pass , the parties he formed the coalition with are farther to the left than his party . The C.C.L.A . made a unique plea here . Asking that the party leaderships allow members to vote their personal conscience on this could open a door for this current government to start to collapse . This is commonplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s vote could be the beginning of the end of Son of Pierre ’ s disastrous reign in Canada . As I said earlier , the parties that did join to give Trudeau the Prime Ministers ’ chair last year are farther to the left than the Liberal Party and who knows how they could vote tonight ? Do they come to their senses and project forward and consider that if a Conservative P.M. were to do this , it could be them that have their assets seized for protesting against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being they are scared Trudeau could come after them anyway ?

""""""" Look out , educators . You ’ re about to confront a pernicious new challenge that is spreading , kudzu-like , into your student writing assignments : papers augmented with artificial intelligence . The first online article generator debuted in 2005 . Now , A.I.-generated text can now be found in novels , fake news articles and real news articles , marketing campaigns , and dozens of other written products . The tech is either free or cheap to use , which places it in the hands of anyone . And it ’ s probably already burrowing into America ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.I . program is not “ plagiarism ” in the traditional sense—there ’ s no previous work for the student to copy , and thus no original for teachers ’ plagiarism detectors to catch . Instead , a student first feeds text from either a single or multiple sources into the program to begin the process . The program then generates content by using a set of parameters on a topic , which then can be personalized to the writer ’ s specifications . With a little bit of practice , a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her paper in a fraction of the time that it would normally take to write an essay . I wanted to see what would happen if I fed an A.I . text generator like Sudowrite some sample texts for assignments . ( Sudowrite is just one such program ; I could name more , but I ’ d rather not make it even easier for students to cheat . ) The results showed that teachers must be made aware of what is coming to their classrooms . Say a student wanted to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use an A.I . program to speed along the process . I fed it the first few lines from a recent Pentagon report : “ The PRC is increasingly clear in its ambitions and intentions . Beijing seeks to reshape the international order to better align with its authoritarian system and national interests , as a vital component of its strategy to achieve the ‘ great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. ’ ” The A.I . text generator provided these following sentences : If a high school student turned that in verbatim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something amiss . But if this were turned in at the undergraduate or graduate level , and especially if the student were to edit the text , it would be much harder to detect . Or let ’ s say they need to write a paper about climate change . Here ’ s what came up when I fed Sudowrite the first few lines from an article on climate change impacts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website : It ’ s not particularly insightful , but it provides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The artificial intelligence continued along this slightly edited line of reasoning : The program had likely already been trained to know the term “ climate change ” was connected to the IPCC ; by making certain inferences it could generate text which seemed like a reasonable extension of the idea . What about ninth-grade English ? Channeling my 14-year-old self , I wrote these lines : The computer spat back this take ( which I ’ ve edited slightly ) : Again , the A.I . program had been previously trained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters , themes , and plot elements . But what stood out to me was that the text was crafted at an appropriate writing level for a high schooler , who would be reading about these star-crossed lovers for the first time . The awkward phrasing and the syntax errors baked into the program make it seem convincing . I ’ ve struggled to find the right analogy to describe this phenomenon . Is using A.I . to write graded papers like athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs ? As a society and as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain drugs are forbidden , as they provide the user unfair advantages . Further , the cocktail of drugs flowing through these competitors and malicious sports programs could cause real physical and psychological harm to the athletes themselves . Would individuals using AI in writing be likewise considered in the same boat—a cheat to the system providing undue advantages , which also creates harm in the long run by impeding writing skills ? Or might using A.I . be more like using performance-enhancing gear in sports , which is both acceptable and encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even beginner tennis players today use high-performance carbon composite rackets instead of 1960s-era wooden racket technology . Swimmers wear nylon and elastane suits and caps to reduce drag . Bikers have stronger , lighter bicycles than their counterparts used a generation ago . Baseball bats evolved from wood to aluminum and developed better grips ; baseball mitts have become more specialized over the decades . Numerous educators assert that A.I . is more like the former . They consider using these programs violate academic integrity . Georgetown University professor Lise Howard told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s unethical and an academic violation to use AI to write paragraphs , because academic work is all about original writing. ” Written assignments have two purposes , argues Ani Ross Grubb , part-time faculty member in the Carroll School of Management at Boston College : “ First is to test the learning , understanding , and critical thinking skills of students . Second is to provide scaffolding to develop those skills . Having AI write your assignments would go against those goals. ” Certainly , one can argue that this topic has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes . Using A.I . might open students to serious charges . For instance , American University indicates , “ All papers and materials submitted for a course must be the student ’ s original work unless the sources are cited ” while the University of Maryland similarly notes that it is prohibited to use dishonesty to “ gain an unfair advantage , and/or using or attempting to use unauthorized materials , information , or study aids in any academic course or exercise. ” But some study aids are generally considered acceptable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine to use grammar- and syntax-checking products standard on Microsoft Word and other document creating programs . Other A.I . programs like Grammarly help write better sentences and fix errors . Google Docs finishes sentences in drafts and emails . So the border between using those kinds of assistive computer programs and full-on cheating remains fuzzy . Indeed , as Jade Wexler , associate professor of special education at the University of Maryland , noted , A.I . could be a valuable tool to help level the playing field for some students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectives and students ’ needs , ” she said . “ There ’ s a fine balance making sure both of those are met. ” Thus there are two intertwined questions at work . First : Should institutions permit A.I.-enhanced writing ? If the answer is no , then the second question is : How can professors detect it ? After all , it ’ s unclear whether there ’ s a technical solution to keeping A.I . from worming into student papers . An educator ’ s up-to-date knowledge on relevant sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbiage has not been swiped from pre-existing texts . Still , there may be ways to minimize these artificial enhancements . One is to codify at the institutional level what is acceptable and what is not ; in July the Council of Europe took a few small steps , publishing new guidelines which begin to grapple with these new technologies creating fraud in education . Another would be to keep classes small and give individual attention to students . As Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman , associate professor of English at Northern Kentucky University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a classroom situation where they are unable to provide individualized attention , the chance for students to phone it in—whether this is plagiarism , A.I. , or just writing in a boring , uninvested way—goes up. ” More in-class writing assignments—no screens allowed—could also help . Virginia Lee Strain , associate professor of English and director of the honors program at Loyola University Chicago , further argued , “ AI is not a problem in the classroom when a student sits down with paper and pencil. ” But in many settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t a realistic solution , especially at high schools or colleges with large classes . Educators juggle multiple classes and courses , and for them to get to know every student every semester isn ’ t going to happen . A more aggressive stance would be for high schools and universities to explicitly declare using A.I . will be considered an academic violation—or at least update their honor codes to reflect what they believe is the right side of the line concerning academic integrity . That said , absent a mechanism to police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a new way to generate papers faster . Educators realize some large percentage of students will cheat or try to game the system to their advantage . But perhaps , as Hindman says , “ if a professor is concerned that students are using plagiarism or AI to complete assignments , the assignments themselves are the problem , not the students or the AI. ” If an educator is convinced that students are using these forbidden tools , he or she might consider using alternate means to generate grades such as assigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class presentations . Of course , as Hindman notes , “ these types of high-impact learning practices are only feasible if you have a manageable number of students. ” AI is here to stay whether we like it or not . Provide unscrupulous students the ability to use these shortcuts without much capacity for the educator to detect them , combined with other crutches like outright plagiarism , and companies that sell papers , homework , and test answers , and it ’ s a recipe for—well , not disaster , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been around for centuries .

In 2003 , they used the first overall pick on Marc-André Fleury , the goalie who backstopped the Penguins to another Cup in 2009 and helped out in two more , in 2016 and ’ 17 . In 2004 , when the Washington Capitals took one of the best goal scorers ever , Alex Ovechkin , first overall , the Penguins were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ megastar in his own right , was still there at No . 2 . And then they got even luckier , as the lockout-canceled season gave them great lottery odds for the 2005 draft . The ping-pong balls bounced right , Crosby became a Penguin and exceeded absurd expectations , and the team parlayed its momentum into getting Pennsylvania to buy them a new arena under threat of relocation . Everything ends , though . The Penguins have had a long list of coaches and general managers during the Crosby , Letang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a bit of organizational stability at the top , and that has crashed down rapidly in the past year . Lemieux and co-owner Ron Burkle sold out to Boston Red Sox and Liverpool F.C . owners Fenway Sports Group in 2021 . Team president David Morehouse , who ’ d been in his job since 2007 , stepped down last week , a few months after a sellout streak that dated to 2007 ( an entire arena ago ) ended . The club ’ s new administration has no reason to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Penguins as we know them come apart in a few weeks or another two or three years almost feels immaterial . The Penguins without any of these three players will be unrecognizable from the team that has topped the post-lockout NHL . Crosby and Malkin aren ’ t the best forward duo in the NHL anymore—that ’ s the Edmonton Oilers ’ Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl—but they are still engines that make a playoff team go . Letang is still a workhorse and set a career high with 68 points this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly . It will at least be a sobering reminder that sports aren ’ t as easy as the Penguins have made it look for a while . The horror story the Penguins will try to avoid is that of the Red Wings , whom they lost to in 2008 and beat in 2009 to win this trio ’ s first Cup . The Red Wings had two premier forwards , Henrik Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk , and one of the two best defensemen ever , Nicklas Lidstrom . They got old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in reduced capacities for a few seasons . Datsyuk eventually went home to play in Russia . The Red Wings didn ’ t have a stable of young talent waiting , and they ’ d spent a lot of salary cap space on their aging stars . Next spring will mark 10 years since their last playoff series win . They haven ’ t even played in the tournament for the past six . Anything before 2005 is an apples-to-oranges comparison because of the salary cap ’ s establishment , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the wilderness on the way down . The Edmonton Oilers and New York Islanders did , too , after long stretches of brilliance in the ’ 80s . For years , the Penguins have been near or directly at the bottom of analysts ’ rankings of NHL farm systems . They have frequently traded away prospects for players who could help them win more immediately—a smart strategy , based around the Penguins ’ knowledge that when you have Crosby , Malkin , and Letang , there is nothing to do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings . But the strategy is going to come home to roost , because everything does . They have only made nine first-round draft picks since they landed Crosby , having traded away the rest . When they have made their picks , they have been low ones , because the Penguins are too good to draft early . The cupboard of young talent is as close to bare as it could be for an NHL team . Crosby , Malkin , and Letang are the only thing separating this team from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might all go , but all of them include the Penguins ceasing to be the most consistent team in the league . The franchise got its money ’ s worth , though , as did those of us who care about it . The Penguins ’ success with these three players is now old enough to get a driver ’ s license . It has facilitated a youth hockey enrollment boom in Pittsburgh and given a city with a chip on its shoulder something to holler about forever . The 2022 playoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iteration of the Penguins . That makes these next games worth appreciating if you ’ re a fan—and worth tolerating if you ’ re not , given that your time to shine is coming soon . Crosby , Malkin , and Letang may or may not have one last rabbit in their hats . The exact shape of the end of their time together remains to be seen , and their performances on Tuesday were not indicative of players ready to go quietly . The only reason to know the end is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once it has , the Penguins can do what they always do : Prepare for the universe to gift them another all-time franchise savior , likely not later than 2028 .

""""""" Last month ’ s decision by the members of OPEC+ to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day sparked outrage in Washington . Prominent Democrats were furious , arguing that Saudi Arabia sought higher oil prices in order to weaken US-led sanctions on Russian fossil fuels , and also to benefit Republicans by inflating the cost of gasoline before the midterms . The Saudis insisted that the production cut merely reflected an effort to prevent a future dip in oil prices and denied any intent to fill Vladimir Putin ’ s war chest or doom the Democrats ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Democrats did better than expected in the November 8 voting . Nonetheless , Saudi Arabia ’ s conduct should still spur Congress to take action to reevaluate the US-Saudi partnership . Of particular importance : pressure to end Saudi Arabia ’ s involvement in the brutal war in Yemen , which has continued for over seven years at the cost of nearly 400,000 lives . Following the recent expiration of the UN-brokered truce , Saudi Arabia could decide to restart air strikes , which it conducts with US assistance . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saudi Arabia—whether by withdrawing US troops from the kingdom , pausing weapons sales , or passing the “ No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2021 ” —it is unlikely that congressional ire will result in legislation being passed via the traditional route . By contrast , a War Powers Resolution focused on ending unauthorized US military support for Saudi Arabia ’ s intervention in Yemen would both have privileged status and require prompt congressional action . It is the best way forward if the goal is to call Saudi Arabia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to be brought to the floor , with the support of well over 100 members of Congress from both houses and parties . However , these cosponsorships will disappear once the 118th Congress convenes : The time for congressional action is now . For its part , the Biden administration initially promised “ consequences ” for Saudi Arabia ’ s recent actions , but has since reasserted the importance of US-Saudi ties . It is quite possible that the kingdom and its de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman will get away—yet again—with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because neither the Biden administration nor a substantial portion of Congress wishes to antagonize a long-standing partner , especially one with such power over the global oil market . Similar to the short-lived fury that followed the murder of Jamal Khashoggi , the current umbrage may dissipate , leaving the fundamentals of US-Saudi policy unchanged . The status quo serves the interests of the defense industry , which spent over $ 27 million in donations to Congress in this election cycle alone : Saudi Arabia remains its most important customer . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections vulnerable to the whims of the House of Saud . When the United States represented the most powerful state in the global order , partner countries had no choice but to play by America ’ s rules . But now the Saudis , along with much of the rest of the world , have adjusted their behavior to a new , multipolar reality . Under this new order , useful military hardware can be purchased from a growing list of manufacturers , including China , Turkey , or Iran ; Asia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the world ’ s largest consumer markets ; China and Russia increasingly challenge America ’ s all-powerful self-image . Partners like Saudi Arabia will hedge their bets , maintaining ties with the US , Russia , and China , while also increasingly asserting their own independence and influence on the world stage . For now , however , Saudi Arabia ’ s military remains dependent on US weapons and spare parts . It would take years , if not decades , to switch to an alternate supplier , giving Washington considerable potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yemen , for example . It was arguably the threat of a War Powers Resolution that helped pressure the Saudis to accept the UN brokered truce that held from April to October , as the Saudis wished to avoid the embarrassment of losing the ability to fly their own planes without the assistance of US military contractors . The United States should adapt to the new diffusion of power in the world by pursuing a more realistic foreign policy . Part of this reassessment must involve decoupling the interest of the US arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repressive regimes from US decision-making about what best serves the interests of peace and stability in key regions like the Middle East . Instead however , the Beltway ’ s knee-jerk reaction to the end of American global dominance has generally reflected a desire to recreate the conditions under which other countries acceded to US preferences : the ballooning Pentagon budget reflects this impulse , an urge to spend our way back to supremacy . The US military budget is already larger than the next nine countries combined , and far higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet countries like Saudi Arabia increasingly act contrary to US preferences . As part of a new , more realistic approach to foreign policy , the Biden administration would be wise to impose real consequences for Saudi actions on oil prices and the war in Yemen by cutting off all military support and arms exports until Riyadh curbs its destructive behavior , most importantly by ending US complicity in Saudi military intervention in Yemen .

"Lives are necessarily sacrificed in the national defense, but no imaginable justification exists to risk lives for political ambition, like Gov. Ron DeSantis in his floundering quest for the presidency. He’s advocating not only an ultra-extreme, vaccine-shunning libertarianism in the face of COVID-19, but also policies that would leave the nation defenseless against the next inevitable pandemic. It’s all about getting to the right of former President Donald Trump on a subject that appeals to the know-nothing wing of their party. DeSantis and his quack Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo descended into the depths of irresponsibility when they called on Floridians under 65 to refuse the new mRNA COVID-19 vaccine."
"In 1990s Germany, the deep social fault lines over historical memory were visible in the racks of every newspaper kiosk, where liberal newspapers were sold alongside copies of “Landser” and other magazines that churned out crude tales of German military heroism during World War II. The existence of such publications was initially a shock for me when I arrived in the country as a pre-teen. But upon encountering them during a visit, my Ukrainian grandfather—who had witnessed Nazi brutality firsthand—simply growled, “The idiots who buy this wouldn’t have lasted five minutes.” Though my grandfather’s reaction was shared by many Germans of his generation, there were enough others willing to claim that the “Fuhrer didn’t really know” or that “it wasn’t as bad as they say” to sustain a counternarrative that was also embraced by some younger people. Over the past three weeks, the vicious debate around claims that Hubert Aiwanger—the leader of the Freie Wahler, or FW, party and deputy head of the Bavarian government—circulated antisemitic pamphlets as a high schooler almost 35 years ago illustrates how shallowly these tensions are buried in Germany and how quickly they can resurface. The firestorm unleashed by the revelations on Aug. 25 initially seemed enough to end Aiwanger’s political career. With campaigning underway for Bavaria’s regional elections on Oct. 8, the incident caused serious concerns among the FW’s senior coalition partners in the Christian Social Union, or CSU, about the effect it would have on its own campaign. Yet despite demands from the center-left Social Democratic Party and Greens as well as from within the CSU for Aiwanger’s removal, Bavaria’s regional president and head of the CSU, Markus Soder, opted to keep him and the alliance with the FW in place. By the beginning of September, Aiwanger’s dual strategy of deflecting blame for the incident on his own brother while furiously accusing the daily that published the reports—the Suddeutsche Zeitung—of pursuing an unjust vendetta had paid off. By contrast, Soder’s desperation to avoid a coalition with the Greens has given the staunchly right-wing FW leverage over the CSU in ways that will have profound effects on Bavarian politics after the elections."

""""""" My boys and I had a little exercise when they were young . After every academic , personal , or athletic setback , we changed that negative focus by asking : What one thing could they do differently the next time ? What was the key lesson ? After losing a youth-football championship game , which was a big deal at the time , my 10-year-old nailed an important larger lesson for his life : “ Don ’ t get up for the game at 4:00 when the kickoff isn ’ t ‘ til 7:00. ” Looking forward , Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question after last week ’ s disappointing red ripple that was supposed to be a scarlet wave , or even a ruby tsunami . As I ’ ve written here previously , media thrives on horserace coverage . It ’ s easier than real analysis , seems dramatic , and can be altered at will . Last winter , the 2022 midterms were said to guarantee blowouts for Republicans , given the countless self-inflicted wounds by Joe Biden and his jolly band of spendthrifts – runaway inflation , gas price surges , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply-chain shortages , wanton jacking of the national debt for political gain , sucking our strategic oil reserves dry . Serial lying and Biden ’ s wobbly mental state . The beauty of horserace narratives for media is that audiences on both sides will eagerly consume them — Democrats because they ’ re worried , Republicans because they relish impending victory . And vice versa . But wait ! Along comes the Supreme Court ’ s discard of Roe and the headlines gained question marks : How much will the return of abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn back the red tide ? Media declared it would have a huge effect . Liberals rejoiced . Conservatives fretted . They went back and forth for months . Finally , a red tide became inevitable again because of inflation and recession , probably maybe even a huge red tide . All this , of course , fed GOP over-confidence and motivated liberals to show up for certain . In truth , nothing ever changed except the news narratives . They went poof , like a stock price tumbling simply because a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what some expert said they might . Fodder for media make-believe . Many conservatives believed that midterm hype . Now , we ’ re in a bizarrely perverse cycle . Republicans are badly disappointed despite likely gaining slim House control , which would paralyze Joe Biden ’ s liberal agenda for the second half of his last term . And Biden is claiming victory because his party did not lose by as much as the fictitious narrative said they might . Anyway , nothing stops this man from saying whatever comes into what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veracity be damned . Remember how Bill Clinton sharply changed political course after his crushing 1994 midterm defeats and thus , easily won reelection two years later ? Biden was asked since 75 percent of Americans now say the country is headed in the wrong direction , what is he going to do differently ? “ Nothing , ” said Joe Biden , who turns 80 next weekend , “ because they ’ re just finding out what we ’ re doing. ” What happened in 2020 was American voters gave Democrats effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , and Senate . As they did in 2008 . And then , as they did in 2010 , voters collectively pulled back and gave the other party House control . No one ever accused our nation ’ s voters of paying close attention to their collective actions . Otherwise , they might not have voted so enthusiastically against Donald Trump without closely examining the shaky mental condition of the man they were actually electing . Now , we seem stuck with him for 799 more days . That ’ s 1,150,560 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows through on his threat to seek reelection . Last week , a reporter noted exit polls showing two-thirds of Americans do not want Biden to seek a second term . He asked Biden how that factored into his upcoming reelection decision . Good question actually . Biden , who rarely lets reality inhibit his remarks , answered arrogantly , “ It doesn ’ t. ” ’ What was his message then to the folks whose financial and ballot support he will need ? “ Watch me ! ” Now comes word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , presumably a 2024 campaign launch to get a jump on others and distract from looming legal probes . This isn ’ t the best time for that , however . It will legally crimp his fundraising two years out . It will restrict what he can do with the $ 100+ million he ’ s already raised . He ’ ll be a target for longer . And his loud presence will complicate the Dec. 6 Georgia Senate runoff of Herschel Walker , his own handpicked candidate . When Trump was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant executive and legislative actions — on tax cuts , economic deregulation , job growth , energy independence , crushing ISIS , rebuilding the military , assembling a conservative Supreme Court majority , protecting religious freedom , securing the southern border , and more . All of these significant actions outweighed Trump ’ s frequent forays into personal grievances and petty retributions , which could be dismissed as mere distractions . But as you may have noticed from the state of the country and economy , Trump is no longer chief executive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up attention are formulaic rallies and petty retributions , which the adopted Republican is now aiming not at Democrats but at fellow GOP leaders he perceives as personally disloyal . This includes Virginia Gov . Glenn Youngkin , who avoided Trump connections in his election last year , and Florida Gov . Ron DeSantis , whose reelection campaign just swamped his opponent in Trump ’ s home state . DeSantis has called Trump a political mentor and Trump ’ s praised the governor as an ally . Trump , however , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strangely , he ’ s even taken to mocking the governors ’ names . As time passed , Trump ’ s ongoing claim that he really won in 2020 is no longer gaining the same traction . Many Americans have moved on to more immediate and future concerns over inflation , jobs , decaying 401k values , and a president and vice president who too often sound like turkeys gobbling nonsense . To underline his political clout and , he hoped , prompt potential 2024 rivals to abstain , Trump encouraged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many just before the election when outcomes seemed clear . Loyalty to him was key , as measured by professed denials of 2020 election results . But our HotAir colleague David Strom noted an unexpected and ominous outcome of last week ’ s elections : Trump ’ s strategy and some sloppy vetting produced a number of novice candidates whose campaign organizations , staffs , and inexperience led to poor issue framing that failed to resonate with enough voters whose current pressing concerns do not include re-litigating moot vote counts . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election success did not materialize despite almost every top issue favoring Republicans . Until now , Trump has remained easily the most popular Republican by an impressively loyal base since the Fifth Avenue billionaire became the most unlikely herald among 17 GOP competitors in 2015 . He earned Heartland voters ’ enduring trust by recognizing and voicing their simmering anger and frustrations with both parties ’ deaf , self-important , and unresponsive DC establishments . Unlike those elites , Trump notably kept his campaign promises and broadened the GOP base . Understandably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , Trump ’ s support has waned some even without any GOP competition . Now , political attention is focused on 2024 . His current influence over voters seems less than impressive based on midterm results . And it ’ s likely to decay even further , as fresh , younger GOP personalities emerge to challenge . Trump typically responds with personal indignation and anger , which is likely to intensify as DeSantis , Youngkin , Mitch McConnell , and others decline to respond in kind or engage at that level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 , especially has surged in party popularity ( and national polls ) with staunchly conservative policies and actions free of the outbursts and distractions of fractious and petty sideline disputes . His strategy has turned the third-most populous state ’ s politics from swing to reliably red . Such open , not always pretty or polite competitions are how our two-party political system imperfectly winnows the fields , hopefully settling on the most-favored candidate to vie for commander in chief . Sometimes , that process produces the best candidate for the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least worst . ( See Joe Biden . ) This week , it seems , Trump will announce his 2024 candidacy and campaign to Again Make America Great Again ( AMAGA ) . After political novice Trump defeated 16 other veteran primary opponents in 2016 , no one should ever underestimate the man ’ s political abilities or determination . Presidential campaign launches have been creeping earlier and earlier . John Kennedy announced 10 months before the 1960 election . Bill Clinton 13 months out . George W. Bush 16 months . Barack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elizabeth Warren 22 months . Trump ’ s would be almost 24 months before .

"This is not to say that Kennedy was obligated to work as a high school football coach forever after the Supreme Court’s ruling. Indeed, it is to his credit that he even went back to coach a single game at all. It would have been much simpler to take the victory and move on. But refusing to coach another game would have deprived this entire charade of the fig leaf it so desperately needed. Almost everyone in this story got what they wanted in the end. Kennedy, who clearly wanted a greater degree of public prominence than he had before, now has a much more lucrative life ahead on the conservative media circuit. Kennedy’s lawyers, who championed his cause all the way to a Supreme Court victory, were awarded $1.7 million in legal fees paid to them by the school district. The conservative justices, who had long sought to overturn Lemon and refashion the establishment clause in their own image, got the opportunity to do so. Even the district won in a roundabout way: Kennedy clearly won’t be holding any more disruptive prayers at midfield after football games. The loser in this case is everyone else. One of the most important limits on the Supreme Court’s power is that, under the Constitution, it can only hear actual “cases and controversies.” The justices can’t just wake up one morning and say X is constitutional and Y is not. They can’t issue advisory opinions based on what they think might happen or should happen. Someone has to bring them a real case with real stakes and real adversaries. Kennedy’s case shows how easily that check on their power can be obliterated if the justices want it to disappear, and how much they can reshape American law once it’s gone. All it takes is a story that is, both literally and figuratively, too good to be true."

"A recent survey on Canadian public opinion conducted by EKOS Research Associates and sponsored by CJPME has found that Canadians use the term “apartheid” the most to describe the state of Israel. Only a minority of Canadians see Israel as a “vibrant democracy”. The survey aimed to understand the general Canadian perception regarding the democratic nature of Israel, given the contrasting descriptions of Israel as a democracy and the belief that it is practicing apartheid. Excluding the respondents who selected “I don’t know”, the EKOS survey discovered that the majority of Canadians perceive Israel as “a state practicing segregation akin to apartheid” (38 per cent). This is over three times the number of Canadians who described Israel as a vibrant democracy (11 per cent)."

"New Jersey's senior senator, Bob Menendez, was indicted Friday morning on sweeping and lurid bribery charges that sound like the plot of a paperback spy novel, with gold bars, wads of cash, a fancy car and other inducements to pay off a powerful lawmaker accused of using his position to provide sensitive information to a foreign government. It was the second time Menendez has faced serious legal trouble. He avoided conviction on different federal bribery charges when a jury deadlocked in 2017, and he successfully ran for reelection in 2018. But this time, Democrats – who are demanding accountability for former President Donald Trump and who are battling GOP claims that the Department of Justice has been ""weaponized"" against Republicans under President Joe Biden's administration – are not rallying around Menendez."

The main contenders to succeed current Governor Omar Perotti are Senator Marcelo Lewandowski from the ruling Peronist party and Maximiliano Pullaro from the opposing coalition Juntos por el Cambio (JxC). Santa Fe voters will also elect new legislators — 19 departmental senators and 50 deputy seats are in play —, 46 mayors, including Santa Fe city and Rosario, 217 councilmen and more than 1,600 municipality positions. Unidos para Cambiar Santa Fe, JxC’s ally coalition in Santa Fe, won 63% of the vote in the provincial primaries held on July 16. The PASO results left four tickets that will compete in Sunday’s elections: Lewandowski and Silvina Frana for Juntos Avancemos; Pullaro and Gisela Scaglia for Unidos para Cambiar Santa Fe; Edelvino Bodoira and Nora Sánchez for Viva la Libertad; and Carla Deiana and Mauricio Acosta for the Frente de Izquierda y los Trabajadores."

""""""" The British Museum has pledged not to dismantle its collection , following a report that the institution ’ s chairman has held secret talks with Greece ’ s prime minister over the return of the Parthenon Sculptures , also known as the Elgin Marbles . The report by the Greek newspaper Ta Nea is the latest twist in the long-running dispute over ownership of the ancient sculptures , which originally stood on the Acropolis in Athens and have been a centerpiece of the British Museum ’ s collection since 1816 . Ta Nea reported Saturday that negotiations between museum Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitsotakis have been taking place since November 2021 and are at an advanced stage . While the museum didn ’ t deny that talks have taken place , a spokesman refused to discuss the specifics of the Ta Nea story .

( Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images ) The Biden administration on Monday announced that it is looking to restore an Obama-era health care non-discrimination rule that interpreted “ sex ” to mean sexual identity or gender . The proposed U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) rule would implement Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act , which “ prohibits discrimination on the basis of race , color , national origin , sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs and activities. ” The Biden administration is proposing to restore an abstract Obama-era definition of sex as “ one ’ s internal sense of gender , which may be male , female , neither , or a combination of male and female. ” For this reason , the move is seen as a win by the LGBT community and its advocates . This was previously struck down in October 2019 during the Trump administration , after a federal court found the ruling was probably contrary to applicable civil rights law , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administrative Procedure Act . The move forms part of U.S. President Joe Biden ’ s agenda to “ advance gender and health equity and civil rights ” and championing of LGBT issues , and comes as a number of states move to ban or place restrictions on trans-related surgeries for minors . HHS stated in a press release that the proposed rule will “ affirm protections against discrimination on the basis of sex , including sexual orientation and gender identity. ” Officials from HHS said the proposed rule was about providing access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from discrimination. ” “ Health care should be a right not dependent on looks , location , love , language , or the type of care someone needs , ” said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra . HHS said the proposed changes to Section 1557 of the ACA will “ address gaps in regulations. ” It cites the Supreme Court decision in Bostock vs. Clayton County in its rule-making proposal .

""""""" Ukrainian-Democratic coordination traces back to 2014 , when then-Obama Vice President Joe Biden helped install Petro Poroshenko in Kiev . Then came collusion against Trump . Six years ago , before Russia ’ s full-scale invasion of their country , the Ukrainians bet that a Hillary Clinton presidency would offer better protection from Russian President Vladimir Putin , even though he had invaded Crimea during the Obama-Biden administration , whose Russian policies Clinton vowed to continue . Working with both the Obama administration and the Clinton campaign , Ukrainian government officials intervened in the 2016 race to help Clinton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematic foreign influence operation that 's been largely ignored by the press . The improper , if not illegal , operation was run chiefly out of the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington , where officials worked hand-in-glove with a Ukrainian-American activist and Clinton campaign operative to attack the Trump campaign . The Obama White House was also deeply involved in an effort to groom their own favored leader in Ukraine and then work with his government to dig up dirt on – and even investigate -- their political rival . Ukrainian and Democratic operatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaging information on Trump and his advisers – including allegations of illicit Russian-tied payments that , though later proved false , forced the resignation of his campaign manager Paul Manafort . The embassy actually weighed a plan to get Congress to investigate Manafort and Trump and stage hearings in the run-up to the election . As it worked behind the scenes to undermine Trump , Ukraine also tried to kneecap him publicly . Ukraine 's ambassador took the extraordinary step of attacking Trump in an Op-Ed article published in The Hill , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top Ukrainian officials slammed the GOP candidate on social media . At first glance , it was a bad bet as Trump upset Clinton . But by the end of his first year in office , Trump had supplied Ukrainians what the Obama administration refused to give them : tank-busting Javelin missiles and other lethal weapons to defend themselves against Russian incursions . Putin never invaded on Trump 's watch . Instead , he launched an all-out invasion during another Democratic administration – one now led by President Biden , Barack Obama 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State last year alarmed Putin by testifying , “ We support Ukraine 's membership in NATO. ” Biden boasted he ’ d go “ toe to toe ” with Putin , but that did n't happen as the autocrat amassed tanks along Ukraine ’ s border in response to the NATO overtures . The Ukrainian mischief is part of Special Counsel John Durham ’ s broader inquiry – now a full-blown criminal investigation with grand jury indictments – into efforts to falsely target Trump as a Kremlin conspirator in 2016 and beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handling of Chalupa and the DNC Sources say Durham has interviewed several Ukrainians , but it ’ s not likely the public will find out exactly what he 's learned about the extent of Ukraine ’ s meddling in the election until he releases his final report , which sources say could be several months away . In the meantime , a comprehensive account of documented Ukrainian collusion – including efforts to assist the FBI in its 2016 probe of Manafort – is pieced together here for the first time . It draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated from a secret Federal Election Commission investigation of the Democratic National Committee that includes never-before-reviewed sworn affidavits , depositions , contracts , emails , text messages , legal findings and other documents from the case . RealClearInvestigations also examined diplomatic call transcripts , White House visitor logs , lobbying disclosure forms , congressional reports and closed-door congressional testimony , as well as information revealed by Ukrainian and Democratic officials in social media postings , podcasts and books . The coordination between Ukrainian and Democratic officials can be traced back at least to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top Obama diplomats – many of whom now hold top posts in the Biden administration – began engineering regime change in Kiev , eventually installing a Ukrainian leader they could control . On Jan. 27 , U.S . Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt phoned Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland at her home in Washington to discuss picking opposition leaders to check the power of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych , whom they believed was too cozy with Putin . “ We ’ ve got to do something to make it stick together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , adding that they needed “ somebody with an international personality to come out here and help to midwife this thing. ” Nuland responded that Biden ’ s security adviser Jake Sullivan had just told her that the vice president – who was acting as Obama ’ s point man in Ukraine – would give his blessing to the deal . “ Biden ’ s willing , ” she said . But they agreed they had to “ move fast ” and bypass the European Union . “ Fuck the EU , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a leaked transcript of their call . Nuland ’ s role in the political maneuvering was not limited to phone calls . She traveled to Kiev and helped organize street demonstrations against Yanukovych , even handing out sandwiches to protesters . In effect , Obama officials greased a revolution . Within months , Yanukovych was exiled and replaced by Petro Poroshenko , who would later do Biden ’ s bidding – including firing a prosecutor investigating his son Hunter . Poroshenko would also later support Clinton 's White House bid after Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of his older son Beau . The U.S. meddling resulted in the installation of an anti-Putin government next door to Russia . A furious Putin viewed the interference as an attempted coup and soon marched into Crimea . Nuland is now Biden ’ s undersecretary of state and Sullivan serves as his national security adviser . Whispering in their ear at the time was a fiery pro-Ukraine activist and old Clinton hand , Alexandra “ Ali ” Chalupa . A daughter of Ukrainian immigrants , Chalupa informally advised the State Department and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized multiple meetings between Ukraine experts and the National Security Council to push for Yanukovych ’ s ouster and economic sanctions against Putin . In the NSC briefings , Chalupa also agitated against longtime attorney-lobbyist Manafort , who at the time was an American consultant for Yanukovych 's Party of Regions , which she viewed as a cat ’ s paw of Putin . She warned that Manafort worked for Putin ’ s interests and posed a national security threat . At the same time , Chalupa worked closely with then-Vice President Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls with his staff and Ukrainians . Another influential adviser at the time was former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele , who provided Nuland with written reports on the Ukrainian crisis and Russia that echoed Chalupa ’ s warnings . Nuland treated them as classified intelligence , and between the spring of 2014 and early 2016 , she received some 120 reports on Ukraine and Russia from Steele . In April 2015 , the DNC hired Chalupa as a $ 5,000-a-month consultant , according to a copy of her contract , which ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years earlier , Chalupa had worked full-time for the DNC as part of the senior leadership team advising Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . ) After Trump threw his hat in the ring in June 2015 , Chalupa grew concerned that Manafort was or would be involved with his campaign since Manafort had known Trump for decades and lived in Trump Tower . She expressed her concerns to top DNC officials and “ the DNC asked me to do a hit on Trump , ” according to a transcript of a 2019 interview on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrea Chalupa , who describes herself as a journalist , boasted in a November 2016 tweet : “ My sister led Trump/Russia research at DNC. ” ) Chalupa began encouraging journalists both in America and Ukraine to dig into Manafort ’ s dealings in Ukraine and expose his alleged Russian connections . She fed unsubstantiated rumors , tips and leads to the Washington Post and New York Times , as well as CNN , speaking to reporters on background so a DNC operative wouldn ’ t be sourced . “ I spent many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background , directing them to contacts and sources , and giving them information , ” Chalupa said . But no reporter worked closer with her than Yahoo News correspondent Michael Isikoff . He even accompanied her to the Ukrainian Embassy , where they brainstormed attacks on Manafort and Trump , according to FEC case files . Chalupa was also sounding alarm bells in the White House . In November 2015 , for example , she set up a White House meeting between a Ukrainian delegation including Ukraine Ambassador Valeriy Chaly and NSC advisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young CIA analyst on loan to the White House who later would play a significant role as anonymous `` whistleblower '' in Trump ’ s first impeachment . In addition to Putin ’ s aggression , the group discussed the alleged security threat from Manafort . Chalupa was back in the White House in December . All told , she would visit the Obama White House at least 27 times , Secret Service logs show , including attending at least one event with the president in 2016 . On Jan. 12 , 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP primary – Chalupa told top DNC official Lindsey Reynolds she was seeing strong indications that Putin was trying to steal the 2016 election for Trump . Emails also show that she promised to lead an effort to expose Manafort – whom Trump would not officially hire as his campaign chairman until May – and link him and Trump to the Russian government . That same day , Chalupa visited the White House . A week later , Obama officials gathered with Ukrainian officials traveling from Kiev in the White House for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things , discuss reviving a long-closed investigation into payments to American consultants working for the Party of Regions , according to Senate documents . The FBI had investigated Manafort in 2014 but no charges resulted . One of the attendees , Ukrainian Embassy political officer Andrii Telizhenko , recalled Justice Department officials asking investigators with Ukraine ’ s National Anti-Corruption Bureau , or NABU , if they could help find fresh evidence of party payments to such U.S. figures . ( Three years later , Democrats would impeach Trump for allegedly asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political rival , Joe Biden . ) The Obama administration ’ s enforcement agencies leaned on their Ukrainian counterparts to investigate Manafort , shifting resources from an investigation of a corrupt Ukrainian energy oligarch who paid Biden ’ s son hundreds of thousands of dollars through his gas company , Burisma . “ Obama ’ s NSC hosted Ukrainian officials and told them to stop investigating Hunter Biden and start investigating Paul Manafort , ” said a former senior NSC official who has seen notes and emails generated from the meetings and spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the FBI reopened its Manafort investigation . “ In January 2016 , the FBI initiated a money laundering and tax evasion investigation of Manafort predicated on his activities as a political consultant to members of the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian politicians , ” according to a report by the Justice Department ’ s watchdog . The White House summit with Ukrainian officials ran for three days , ending on Jan. 21 , according to a copy of the agenda stamped with the Justice Department logo . It was organized and hosted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NSC . Other U.S. officials included Justice prosecutors and FBI agents , as well as State Department diplomats . The Ukrainian delegation included Artem Sytnyk , the head of NABU , and other Ukrainian prosecutors . Ciaramella was a CIA detailee to the White House occupying the NSC ’ s Ukraine desk in 2015 and 2016 . In that role , Ciaramella met face-to-face with top Ukrainian officials and provided policy advice to Biden through the then-vice president 's security adviser Michael Carpenter . He also worked with Nuland and Chalupa.Ciaramella was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As RealClearInvestigations first reported , he would later anonymously blow the whistle on Trump asking Ukraine ’ s new president , Volodymyr Zelensky , to help “ get to the bottom of ” Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election , a phone call that triggered Trump ’ s first impeachment by a Democrat-controlled House . Ciaramella ’ s former NSC colleague Alexander Vindman leaked the call to him . Vindman , a Ukrainian-American , is also aligned with Chalupa . ( Vindman is now back in the news for his demands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support to Ukraine and his insistence that Trump shares great blame for the war . ) On Feb. 2 , two weeks after the White House meetings , Secret Service logs reveal that Ciaramella met in the White House with officials from the U.S. Treasury Department ’ s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network , known as FinCEN , which would later provide the FBI highly sensitive bank records on Manafort . ( In addition , a senior FinCEN adviser illegally leaked thousands of the confidential Manafort records to the media . ) On Feb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House summit , Telizhenko , who worked for the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , met with Zentos of the NSC at a Cosi sandwich shop in Washington , according to emails obtained by the Senate . It 's not known what they discussed . In addition , on Feb. 23 , the two emailed about setting up another meeting the following day . “ OK if I bring my colleague Eric , who works on Ukraine with me ? ” Zentos asked Telizhenko , apparently referring to Ciaramella . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary elections , among other things . Telizhenko would later testify that Ambassador Chaly had ordered him then to “ start an investigation [ into the Trump campaign ] within the embassy just on my own to find out with my contacts if there ’ s any Russian connection that we can report back. ” He suspects the Ambassador delivered that report to Chalupa and the DNC . Chalupa visited the White House on Feb. 22 , entrance records show , just days before the second meeting Telizhenko had planned with Zentos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to meet again , this time at a Washington bar called The Exchange . According to their email , Zentos wrote , “ I ’ ll see if my colleague Eric is up for joining. ” The pair also met the next day at Swing ’ s coffee house in Washington . After the meeting , Telizhenko emailed Zentos seeking a meeting with senior Obama NSC official Charlie Kupchan , an old Clinton hand who was Ciaramella ’ s boss on the Russia/Ukraine desk . Kupchan is an outspoken critic of Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ can do to stop him ” and “ protect the international institutions we ’ ve built . ” Zentos and Telizhenko also met on March 10 , patronizing the Cosi coffee shop again . On March 24 , 2016 , four days before the Trump campaign announced that it had hired Manafort , Chalupa met at the Ukrainian Embassy with Ambassador Chaly and his political counselor Oksana Shulyar , where they shared their concerns about Manafort , according to Politico . When news broke on March 28 that Manafort was joining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . “ This is huge , ” she texted senior DNC officials . “ This is everything to take out Trump. ” She immediately began circulating anti-Manafort memos , warning the DNC of the “ threat ” he posed of Russian influence . The next day , March 29 , she briefed the DNC communications team about Manafort . They , in turn , hatched a plan to reach out to the Ukrainian Embassy to get President Porochenko to make an on-camera denouncement of Manafort and feed the footage to ABC News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works as a top anchor . On March 30 , Chalupa fired off an email to Shulyar , her contact at the Ukrainian Embassy : '' There is a very good chance that President Poroshenko may receive a question from the press during his visit about the recent New York Times article saying that Donald Trump hired Paul Manafort as an adviser to his campaign and whether President Poroshenko is concerned about this considering Trump is the likely Republican nominee and given Paul Manafort ’ s meddling in Ukraine over the past couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` It is important President Poroshenko is prepared to address this question should it come up . In a manner that exposes Paul Manafort for the problems he continues to cause Ukraine . '' Within minutes of sending the email , Chalupa wrote the DNC ’ s communications director Luis Miranda , “ The ambassador has the messaging. ” Then she reached out to a friend in Congress , Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio , about holding hearings to paint Manafort as a pro-Kremlin villain . April 2016 : Chalupa Solicits Ukrainian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Manafort American presidential campaigns are n't supposed to work with foreign governments to dig up dirt on their political opponents . Geneva Convention rules bar diplomats from becoming entangled in their host country ’ s political affairs , particularly elections . There are also federal laws banning foreign nationals from engaging in operations to influence or interfere with U.S. political and electoral processes . In 2018 , Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals on charges of conspiring to defraud the U.S. government for that purpose . But just weeks after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Ukrainian Embassy appeared to be working with the Clinton campaign to torpedo him and the campaign . Emails reveal that Chalupa and Shulyar , a top aide to Ambassador Chaly , agreed to meet for coffee on April 7 , 2016 , at Kafe Leopold , a restaurant near the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington . ( Chalupa had paid a visit to the White House just three days earlier . ) One of the purposes of the meeting , according to FEC case files , was to discuss Manafort and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined at the café by Telizhenko , who said he was working on a “ big story ” on Manafort and Trump with the Wall Street Journal . In a sworn 2019 deposition taken by the FEC , Telizhenko alleged that Chalupa solicited “ dirt ” on Trump , Manafort , and the Trump campaign during the meeting . Telizhenko also testified that Chalupa told him that her goal was “ basically [ to ] use this information and have a committee hearing under Marcy Kaptur , congresswoman from Ohio , in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections . '' Telizhenko later approached Ambassador Chaly about the DNC representative 's overtures and he responded : “ Yes . And I know that this is happening . You should work with her . '' After speaking with Chaly , Telizhenko claims that he went back to Shulyar who instructed him to help Chalupa . “ I went to Oksana and said , ‘ Like what are we doing ? ’ ” he testified. `` And she told me , ‘ You have to work with Chalupa . And any information you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ’ ll give it to her , then we ’ ll pass it on later to anybody else we are coordinating with. ’ ” Less than a week later , on April 13 , Telizhenko met again with White House official Zentos , email records reveal . Telizhenko said he resigned the next month because of concerns regarding his embassy ’ s work with Chalupa and the Clinton team . In her sworn account of the meeting , Chalupa acknowledged discussing Manafort and the “ national security problem ” he allegedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for help researching him . She allowed that she “ could have mentioned the congressional investigation … that I had talked to Marcy Kaptur , ” but maintained she could n't recall trying to enlist the embassy in the effort . Shulyar , however , clearly recalls that Chalupa sought the embassy ’ s help warning the public about Manafort – including pitching stories to the press and lobbying Congress , according to a 2020 written statement to the FEC . An “ idea floated by Alexandra Chalupa was that we approach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiate a congressional hearing on Paul Manafort , ” Shulyar said , though she denied the embassy acted on the idea . Around the same time , two Ukrainian lawmakers – Olga Bielkova and Pavlo Rizanenko – visited the U.S. and met with journalists , as well as a former State Department official with close ties to Sen. John McCain – David Kramer of the McCain Institute . Kramer would later leak the entire Steele dossier to the media . The meeting was arranged by major Clinton Foundation donor Victor Pinchuk , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Obama ’ s secretary of state . Bielkova was also connected to the Clinton Foundation , having once managed a Clinton Global Initiative program for Ukrainian college students . While Clinton was at Foggy Bottom from 2009 to 2013 , Ukrainians gave more money – at least $ 10 million , including more than $ 8 million from Pinchuk – to the Clinton Foundation than any other nationality including Saudi Arabians . Pinchuk 's donation was a down payment on an astounding $ 29 million pledge . On April 12 , 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ciaramella and his NSC colleague Zentos , head of the Eastern Europe desk , according to lobbying disclosure records . In late April , Chalupa helped organize a Ukrainian-American protest against Manafort in his Connecticut hometown . Activists shouted for Trump to fire Manafort , whom they called “ Putin ’ s Trojan Horse , ” while holding signs that read : “ Shame on Putin , Shame on Manafort , Shame on Trump ” and “ Putin , Hands Off the U.S. Election. ” Chalupa also organized social media campaigns against Manafort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists to share the Twitter hashtags : “ # TrumpPutin ” and `` # Treasonous Trump . '' Also that month , Chalupa reached out to Yahoo News reporter Isikoff to pitch a hit piece on Manafort . She connected him with a delegation of Ukrainian journalists visiting D.C. Isikoff would later be used by Steele to spread falsehoods from his dossier . In a May 3 email , Chalupa alerted DNC communications director Luis Miranda and DNC opposition research director Lauren Dillion that there was “ a lot more [ dirt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sic ] . ” Chalupa told them the dirt has “ a big Trump component ” and would “ hit in the next few weeks. ” It ’ s not clear if she was referring to the notorious `` black ledger ” smear against Manafort , who was promoted to campaign chairman on May 19 , but a story about it was brewing at the time . On May 30 , Nellie Ohr , an opposition researcher for the Clinton-retained firm Fusion GPS , emailed her husband , Bruce Ohr , a top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a prime disseminator of the Steele dossier within the government , and two federal prosecutors to alert them to an article indicating NABU had suddenly discovered documents allegedly showing Manafort receiving illicit payments . Amid the flurry of anti-Manafort activity , Zentos met again with Telizhenko on May 4 , records show . And Chalupa visited the White House for a meeting on May 13 . Chalupa paid another visit to the White House on June 14 , Secret Service logs show . On June 17 , Ciaramella held a White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department to discuss undisclosed Ukrainian matters . In late June , the FBI signed an evidence-sharing agreement with NABU , less than two months before the Ukrainian anti-corruption agency released what it claimed was explosive new evidence on Manafort . Chalupa continued to pow-wow with the Ukrainian Embassy and got so cozy with officials there that they offered her a position , which she declined , as an “ embedded consultant ” in the country ’ s Ministry of Foreign Affairs . That same month , high-ranking Ukrainian officials openly insulted Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from normal diplomacy . For instance , Ukraine Minister of Internal Affairs Arsen Avakov tweeted that Trump was a “ clown ” who was “ an even bigger danger to the U.S. than terrorism. ” In another July post , he called Trump “ dangerous for Ukraine. ” And on Facebook , Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk warned that Trump had “ challenged the very values of the free world . '' “ It was clear that they were supporting Hillary Clinton ’ s candidacy , ” Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Artemenko told Politico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings with the Clinton team to publicly supporting her to criticizing Trump . '' While attending the Democratic convention in Philadelphia , Chalupa spread the scurrilous rumor that Manafort was the mastermind behind the alleged Russian hacking of the DNC and that he “ stole '' her and other Democrats ’ emails . She later told her sister ’ s podcast that she had reported her conspiracy theory to the FBI , eventually sitting down and meeting with agents in September to spin her tale of supposed espionage ( the Senate has asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summaries , known as FD-302s ) . Chalupa also prepared a report for the FBI , as well as members of Congress , detailing her Russiagate conspiracy theories , which Mueller later found no evidence to support . In addition , Chalupa helped spread a false narrative that Trump removed a reference to providing arms to Kiev from the Republican platform at the party 's convention earlier that month . Internal platform committee documents show the Ukraine plank could not have been weakened as claimed , because the “ lethal ” weapons language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform . The final language actually strengthened the platform by pledging direct assistance not just to the country of Ukraine , but to its military in its struggle against Russian-backed forces . In another attempt to influence the 2016 election , Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko leaked to the U.S. media what he claimed was evidence of a secret handwritten ledger showing Manafort had received millions in cash from Yanukovych ’ s party under the table . He claimed that 22 pages of the alleged ledger , which contained line items written by hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailbox earlier that year . Leshchenko would not identify the sender . A fuller copy of the same document showed up later on the doorstep of a Ukrainian intelligence official who passed it to NABU , which shared it with FBI agents stationed in Kiev . Leshchenko and NABU officials held press conferences declaring the document was “ proof '' of Manafort corruption and demanding he be “ interrogated. ” The Clinton campaign seized on the story . In an Aug. 14 statement , campaign manager Robby Mook stated : “ We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump 's team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine. ” He demanded Trump `` disclose campaign chair Paul Manafort 's and all other campaign employees ' and advisers ' ties to Russian or pro-Kremlin entities . '' But there was a big hole in the story . Though Manafort was a consultant to Yanukovych 's party , he was paid by wire , not in cash , casting serious doubt on the ledger ’ s authenticity . Another problem : the ledger was alleged to have been kept at party headquarters , but rioters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . Leshchenko admitted that he had a political agenda . He told The Financial Times at the time that he went public with the ledger because “ a Trump presidency would change the pro-Ukrainian agenda in American foreign policy. ” He added that most of Ukraine ’ s politicians are “ on Hillary Clinton ’ s side . '' Leshchenko also happened to be `` a source for Fusion GPS , ” as Nellie Ohr confirmed under questioning during a 2019 closed-door House hearing , according to a declassified transcript . Fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign , which gave the private opposition-research firm more than $ 1 million to gin up connections between Trump and Russia . Fusion hired Steele to compile a series of “ intelligence ” memos known as the dossier . As a former MI6 operative , Steele gave the allegations a sheen of credibility . FBI counterintelligence veteran Mark Wauck said the dossier and the black ledger both appear to have originated with Fusion GPS , which laundered it through foreigners who hated Trump – Steele and Leshchenko . `` The ledger and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Wauck said . “ The two items shared a common origin : the Hillary campaign ’ s oppo research shop . '' In an August 2016 memo written for Fusion GPS , “ The Demise of Trump ’ s Campaign Manager Paul Manafort , ” Steele claimed he had corroborated Leshchenko ’ s charges through his anonymous Kremlin sources , who turned out to be nothing more than beer buddies of his primary source collector , Igor Danchenko , a Russian immigrant with a string of arrests in the U.S. for public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danchenko had worked for the Brookings Institution , a Democratic think tank in Washington that Durham has subpoenaed in connection to its own role in Russiagate . Danchenko was indicted last year by Special Counsel Durham for lying about his sources , including one he completely made up , as RCI reported . “ YANUKOVYCH had confided in PUTIN that he did authorize and order substantial kick-back payments to MANAFORT as alleged , ” Steele claimed in the unsubstantiated report , citing “ a well-placed Russian figure ” with knowledge of a `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ held in secret ” on Aug. 15 . As a paid informant , Steele had long reported to the FBI about alleged corruption involving Yanukovych . The FBI used his Clinton-funded dossier as a basis to obtain warrants to spy on former Trump adviser Carter Page , including the false claim that Page acted as an intermediary between Russian leadership and Manafort in a “ well-developed conspiracy of cooperation ” that included sidelining Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue . Steele also falsely claimed that Page had helped draft the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Russia ’ s interests by eliminating language about providing weapons to Ukraine , according to a report by the Department of Justice 's watchdog . In fact , Page was not involved in the GOP platform . The misinformation came from Danchenko ’ s fictional source . Fusion co-founder Glenn Simpson worked closely with the New York Times on the Manafort ledger story . In his book , “ Crime in Progress , ” Simpson boasts of introducing Leshchenko to the Times as a source , who ended up providing the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Aug. 19 , Manafort stepped down from the Trump campaign the day after the Times reported what it had been fed by the anti-Trump operatives . In effect , Ukrainian government officials tried to help Clinton and undermine Trump by disseminating documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and telling the American media they were investigating the matter . In 2018 , a Ukrainian court ruled that Leshchenko and NABU ’ s Sytnyk illegally interfered in the 2016 U.S. election by publicizing the black ledger . Among the evidence was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ledger to help Clinton ’ s campaign – “ I helped her , ” Sytnyk is recorded boasting . But the damage was done . The Ukrainians , along with Chalupa and the Clinton camp , achieved their goal of undermining the Trump campaign by prompting Manafort ’ s ouster though they never proved he was colluding with the Russians . Neither did Special Counsel Mueller . In fact , Mueller did not use the ledger to prosecute Manafort after a key witness for the prosecution told him it was fabricated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot potato , ” Wauck said . Ukraine ’ s neutrality in the election was also called into further question that September , when Porochenko met with Clinton during a stop in New York . He never met with Trump , who appeared to get the cold shoulder from the Ukrainian leader . In statements following Trump ’ s surprise victory over Clinton in November , Ukraine ’ s embassy has denied interfering in the election and insisted that Chalupa was acting on her own . After Trump won the election in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chalupa predicted : “ Under President Trump , the Kremlin could likely invade U.S. allies in Europe without U.S. opposition. ” Not only did Russia not invade Europe “ under Trump , ” it didn ’ t even invade Ukraine . Rather , the invasion came under Biden , whose campaign Chalupa supported . Yet she continues to blame Trump . Recent tweets show a still-obsessed Chalupa has not dialed back her extremist views about Trump or Manafort , whom she believes should be prosecuted for “ treason . '' In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , Chalupa claimed that Putin installed “ a puppet regime in the U.S. with the help of Paul Manafort. ” The previous day , she tweeted , “ We had a Putin installed Trump presidency. ” A day before that , she wrote : “ Now would be a good time to release the Putin-Trump treason calls. ” And on Feb. 25 , Chalupa tweeted another wild conspiracy theory : `` It ’ s important to note that Putin ’ s imperial aspirations are of a global criminal empire , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president and tried to turn the U.S. into a Russian satellite state .

"In the past 24 hours, two reports out of Israel have pointed to a striking conclusion: that the failure to prevent Hamas’s murderous assault on southern Israel rests in significant part with the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. First, the Washington Post’s Noga Tarnopolsky and Shira Rubin wrote a lengthy dispatch on the many policy failures that allowed Hamas to break through. They find that, in addition to myriad unforgivable intelligence and military mistakes — especially shocking given Israel’s reputation in both fields — there were serious political problems. Distracted by both the fight to seize control over Israel’s judiciary and their effort to deepen Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Netanyahu and his cabinet allowed military readiness to degrade and left outposts on the Gaza border in the south unmanned. “There was a need for more soldiers, so where did they take them from? From the Gaza border, where they thought it was calm ... not surprising that Hamas and Islamic Jihad noticed the low staffing at the border,” Aharon Zeevi Farkash, the former head of the Israel Defense Forces’ military intelligence, said in comments reported by the Post."

' ” “ Under the terms of the contract , the data could be accessed to identify and analyze any security breaches or threats , ” Joffe ’ s spokesperson said . “ As a result of the hacks of EOP and DNC servers in 2015 and 2016 , respectively , there were serious and legitimate national security concerns about Russian attempts to infiltrate the 2016 election . Upon identifying DNS queries from Russian-made Yota phones in proximity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected cybersecurity researchers were deeply concerned about the anomalies they found in the data and prepared a report of their findings , which was subsequently shared with the CIA. ” Durham said his team has “ identified no support for ” the allegations that the data reflected suspicious DNS lookups by internet addresses affiliated with a Russian mobile phone provider , or Yota . Lawyers for Michael Sussman , the Clinton campaign lawyer who has been charged with lying to the FBI , also responded Monday to the Durham filing . They argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ostensibly about potential conflicts of interest , included “ prejudicial—and false—allegations that are irrelevant to his motion and to the charged offense , and are plainly intended to politicize this case , inflame media coverage , and taint the jury pool. ” The allegations pertaining to the DNS traffic , for instance , were not included in Sussman ’ s indictment and “ were not necessary to identify any of the potential conflicts of interest with which the motion is putatively concerned , ” they added . “ Why then include them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants the court to strike the portion of the motion that outlines the allegations against Joffe and to allow him to retain his counsel , Latham & Watkins , a law firm that has represented other parties that are being or have been investigated by Durham .

"We live in a time of untrammelled and footloose capitalism. Free market capitalism has hardened into a dogmatic and monolithic creed that brooks no opposition. The high priests of capitalism on the couch argue that it “works well for most of the people most of the time.” Despite her policy being despotic, antisocial and an economic cul-desac, Margaret Thatcher boasted “there is no alternative” to capitalism. That has prompted many to believe we now live in the age of what political and cultural theorist Mark Fisher calls ‘capitalist realism’. But has socialist realism died? That may not be the case. However, one thing is clear ~ that the left is yet to posit a coherent alternative political and economic model to capitalism. Given the proliferation of right-wing governments and the marginalisation of left forces in Europe and elsewhere, some analysts have begun to believe that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism."

""""""" The ongoing war in Syria was supposed to be a crucible for the modern Russian war machine , reforming its operational capabilities in preparation for future conflicts . Now that Russia is facing a test of those skills in Ukraine , it is turning into a disaster that they should have seen coming . Moscow officially lost only 112 servicemen in six and a half years in Syria , compared to what it admits are 1,351 in a single month in Ukraine—the true numbers are likely to be far higher . And they have been forced to humiliatingly pull out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chernihiv having failed to make any significant progress in those regions and falling back to their old targets in eastern Ukraine . This raises the question of exactly what the Kremlin learned in Syria and , more importantly , what it should have learned but obviously has not . Unlike Ukraine , Syria ’ s cities would never be part of the Russian federation and could therefore be flattened . Meanwhile , its non-white population was framed as foreign terrorists . Jabhat al-Nusra fighters , ISIS , and hundreds of children were portrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair targets . By contrast , Ukrainians are largely seen by the Russian public as Russians themselves or , at the very least , close cousins . These factors freed Russia up to use Syria as merely a means to an end , or more specifically , two ends . First , it used Syria as a proving ground to enhance command-and-control coordination . Like its Soviet predecessor , Russia 's military is an artillery force with armored battalions and the ground-based nature of its power is not as fast nor flexible as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordination critical . Not to mention , if such command coordination is achieved , then as the Institute for the Study of War ’ s lead Russia analyst , Mason Clark , wrote in a 2021 report , it “ will erode one of the United States and NATO ’ s key technological advantages. ” Second , Moscow declared a withdrawal from Syria in March 2016 , then again in January 2017 , and again in December of that year . This wasn ’ t just a feint to get its enemies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent Russia from being pulled too deeply into the war , thus minimizing losses . But just as importantly , it broke the war into a series of campaigns , allowing Moscow to rotate its forces through Syria , giving them ample combat experience . As Michael Kofman , director of the Russia studies program at the Center for Naval Analyses ( CNA ) , wrote in a 2020 report , “ The entire Russian military must now serve [ in Syria ] in order to progress in rank. ” According William Alberque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arms control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies ( IISS ) , some of the lessons that were not learned well enough include use of drones for artillery spotting , the danger of MANPADS on the contested battlefield , and the need for secure supply lines . Each of these factors have proven devastating for Russian forces in Ukraine . But the biggest lessons , he said , have been how to detect , disrupt , and destroy small groups of fighters , the importance of the destruction not just of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of secure comms , the value of precision-guided missiles , and the benefit of drawing the enemy out rather than engaging in urban warfare . Albuquerque added that Russia learned a few more things in Syria . Namely , “ how to destroy cities , terror tactics to make civilians flee , and the use of proxies as holding forces/cannon fodder. ” So what went wrong ? For one thing , Russia is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , and by far the most corrupt major power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ’ re the Godfather , but it ’ s hard to know who to trust . Moscow recently purged 150 Federal Security Service ( FSB ) agents and sent Sergei Beseda , the head of the FSB ’ s 5th Service , which handles intelligence in Ukraine , to Lefortovo Prison , which was used under Stalin to conduct torture-based interrogations and mass executions . One theory says Beseda gave information to the CIA , but the official reason , which may very well be true , is that he lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for espionage activities in Ukraine . If true , this means Putin ’ s own spy chiefs not only let him bring a knife to a gun fight—they sold off the combat blade and bought a cheap butter spreader . Another thing that led Putin astray was his own over-confidence . Since taking office in 2000 , he has been involved in six wars—Chechnya , Georgia , the North Caucasus , Syria , the Central African Republic ( CAR ) , and Ukraine.All but the last have been victorious . Syria and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bashar al-Assad ’ s regime and Faustin-Archange Touadera ’ s administration represent strategic wins . Putin thought he couldn ’ t lose . Corruption and over-confidence prepared a path , but the biggest problem was Putin ’ s lack of experience ina war of this scale . Syria was a limited deployment in a far-off desert nation with minimal ground forces , Georgia only lasted 12 days , and Russia supported Touadera in the CAR from a distance with weapons , military instructors and Wagner mercenaries . Besides , even if Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russia could simply copy/paste its lessons , it still wouldn ’ t help since Moscow has apparently forgotten those lessons . Russia did apply its Syria lessons in Ukraine—but it did so in 2014 , when it used Crimea to train a rapid-reaction professional force . Now , however , Moscow is running four combined arms headquarters independently with only partial management at the defense center in Moscow . Why ? Partly because it ’ s not just propaganda when Putin talks about a “ special military operation. ” He truly believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would offer little resistance and that the war would only last a matter of days . In Syria , says military historian Peter Caddick-Adams , “ They were not up against a peer adversary—in fact they have never been : Afghan , Chechnya , Georgia , Syria—unlike in Ukraine . Syria was predominantly an air war , with little threat , so Russian pilots treated it more as range practice , dumping munitions on preselected targets ” he told The Daily Beast . “ Thus , what Russia did not learn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms battle ( artillery , armor , anti-tank , air defense , infantry , engineers , etc ) at high tempo in complex terrain with aircraft of different types , helicopters , airborne and marine troops , with a well-balanced logistics and supply system—which is what they have needed for Ukraine. ” He added , “ Russian communications are very lowbrow , and they are using unencrypted mobile phones in Ukraine , a bad habit picked up in Syria , where few opponents could understand Russian or had the technical competence to intercept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PhD in desert warfare is making for a poor career in Ukraine . Indeed , few things have revolutionized the modern Russian military like the war in Syria , but nothing will affect it quite like Ukraine . One might even call this Russia 's Vietnam moment . But one thing ’ s for certain , Russia looked at Ukraine and mistook a tiger for a cat . Now even if it decides to cut its losses and completely withdraw , it may not be so easy . As the old Chinese saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiger , the hard part is getting off . """""""

""""""" ( Ocean Robbins ) Food Revolution Network CEO , Ocean Robbins , sits down with Drs . Rupa Marya and Raj Patel , authors of Inflamed : Deep Medicine and the Anatomy of Injustice , and co-founders of Deep Medicine Circle , for a heartening look at how deep medicine can help to heal our lives , society , and world . Related Healthy Starters and Appetizers for All Occasions Below is the edited transcript of the video above . Ocean Robbins : Welcome to this Food Revolution Conversation . I am Ocean Robbins , your host . We ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we ’ re going to talk about it a little more comprehensively than most people talk about it these days . Chronic inflammation could be , in net effect , the leading cause of death on our planet . It is underlying most of the major chronic illnesses of our times , from Alzheimers to type 2 diabetes from cancer to heart disease to autoimmune conditions . In the context of a pandemic , we ’ ve also seen that people who are suffering from chronic inflammation are far more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they contract COVID-19 . And according to our guests for today ’ s conversation , the chronic inflammation that is rampant in the human body is inextricably linked to a surge in inflammation in our world , showing up in the context of climate chaos , forest fires , and even war and violence . What ’ s more , these have common sources . According to their new book , Inflamed : Deep Medicine and the Anatomy of Injustice — an extraordinary book — there are hidden relationships between our biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political and economic systems . Ocean Robbins : Inflammation is connected to the food we eat , the air we breathe , and the microbes living inside us , which impact our brains , our immune system , and how we experience life . Inflammation is also connected to traumatic events we may have experienced as children and to traumas even endured by our ancestors . It ’ s connected not only to access to healthcare , but to the very models of health that physicians practice . So , we are here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book and who are here to shed some light on all of this . First is Dr. Rupa Marya , a physician , and activist , a mother , and a composer . She is an associate professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco where she practices and teaches internal medicine . She ’ s co-founder of the Do No Harm Coalition . It ’ s a collective of health workers committed to addressing disease through structural change . At the invitation of Lakota health leaders , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I may be mispronouncing that — my apologies if I am — at Standing Rock to help decolonize medicine and food . She is a co-founder of the Deep Medicine Circle , an organization committed to healing the wounds of colonialism through food , medicine , story , and learning . We ’ re also here with Dr. Raj Patel ( PhD ) , a research professor at the University of Texas at Austin ’ s Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs , a professor in the university ’ s department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Rhodes University in South Africa . He ’ s the author of Stuffed and Starved and The New York Times ‘ best-selling , The Value of Nothing , and the co-author of A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things . And he serves on the International Panel of Experts on sustainable food systems and has advised governments worldwide on the causes and solutions to the crises of sustainability . Rupa , Raj , thanks so much for being here with us today . Dr. Raj Patel : Thanks so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , let ’ s jump right in here . You ’ re looking at inflammation broadly , including the human body and the culture , the economy , the world around us . What is inflammation , and why should we care ? Dr. Raj Patel : Well , so inflammation is the way that your body ordinarily heals itself . So in the book , we ’ ve got this example of a paper cut . When you get a paper cut , you ’ ll bleed ; you ’ ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to meet and live with the invaders that may have entered your body through this cut . And this process of inflammation is a way of helping your body return back to normal . That ’ s a sort of short version of what happens in an acute case of inflammation . The problem with inflammation that we talk about in the book is that when your body mobilizes its resources when it ’ s feeling either threatened or is actually under threat or perceives that it may be under threat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , sends your body into a process , not of healing , but of destruction . One could say , “ All right , well , inflammation , we understand stress , and that ’ s all very bad and we should have less stress. ” But there ’ s a bigger story here about how the stress that ’ s around us is part of a story that implicates not just our bodies , but the planet itself . Rupa sees the consequences of this in her medical practice . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us a little bit more about the actual sort of biological and social intersections that you see at the hospital ? Dr. Rupa Marya : Yeah , so the inflammatory response is evolutionarily conserved in mammals and animals , also in other life forms . And it is a response to damage or the threat of damage . And it is the way the body or the organism restores its optimal working conditions . I want to say that as we talk about this… In medicine sometimes , we have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer some healing to offer a way of… You have to lance the wound to get the pus out in order so that a wound can heal and the inflammation can stop . This book is an opportunity to make people who might not be comfortable with understanding the roots of colonialism , how colonial expansion has destroyed the ecosystems around the world , and the mind view that came with it has set up our structures in our society so that food is not equitably resourced in our lives — that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy food and other people have no access to nutritional food . So , this discomfort of maybe having to really understand science and why we really laid out the science of inflammation in the book as best as we could in ways that we hope that an average person who ’ s not used to thinking about these ideas could actually read it , maybe a couple of times if needed , and really understand it and really grasp what ’ s happening in the body and on the planet — in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that discomfort , I just say , is the way through . It ’ s not for the purpose of just being uncomfortable or just polarizing or just inflaming the dialogue , but it ’ s to offer people a way of understanding what they ’ re seeing around them . The Need For Connection and Community Healing Dr. Rupa Marya : For me , this was most strikingly seen when I had a patient who was from Muscle Shoals , Alabama — a woman who grew up in a community where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a polluted watershed : the Tennessee River Valley Watershed . When she was — in UCSF , where I work as a hospital medicine doctor in the ICU — sick for months , and her son shows up with white supremacist tattoos around his eyes and sits there , and we have a conversation about where they lived , and what their lives are like , and what they ’ re exposed to , he comes out of the room just crying and motioning to hug me . And I hold him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , “ No one has ever asked what our lives are like ; no one has really seen what ’ s happening in our communities and how people are dying. ” That to me was like , okay , how do we write this story in a way which will connect all of us who ’ ve been orphaned from the Earth and all of us who ’ ve been divided from each other so that we might all have the opportunity to be healthy and pursue lives with dignity ? So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories and the learnings from the bedside of patients with the work that Raj and I both do in the communities we serve and work with . Ocean Robbins : Thank you . I ’ m moved by your metaphor because I ’ m thinking if I had cancer , I ’ d want to know about it ; I wouldn ’ t want to be told a nice story . Finding out about it might make my day a lot less pleasant – I might feel really sad — but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nice stories that make us feel good . We actually count on them to tell us the truth , right ? So in that sense , I think we want to go to people like yourselves to tell us the truth about the systems that we inhabit . Dr. Rupa Marya : Yeah , I just want to temper that a little bit because the word truth can sometimes scare me and come off as feeling a little religious in some way . So I would say we go to doctors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening . A synthesis and understanding of the data that ’ s in front of us . And what is your best understanding of what ’ s happening . And of course , as with anything , there will be different people who have different interpretations of the data , and that ’ s why it is useful to get peer review and multiple ideas and thoughts . That ’ s what ’ s been so beautiful about working on this book is how many peers we brought in with us and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , it is important that we ’ re going to understand the patterns that we ’ re seeing in front of us and understand it with a depth that can actually advance actions that can help shift the course that we ’ re on right now — because the course we ’ re on right now is not being shifted fast enough . Dr. Rupa Marya : Sorry to temper that . Ocean Robbins : No , I appreciate the nuance . There is no one truth with a capital T. There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also so many different perspectives . And we need a biodiversity of approaches , I think , to create true healing in this world . The sort of notion that there is one right way to live , one right way to think , and everything else should be shut down is part of the sickness , I think , that you ’ re helping to diagnose here so that we can hopefully create some healing systemically . We don ’ t just need one probiotic , we need a huge diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? Similarly , there ’ s no one solution to every problem , but there is a deeper understanding of wisdom that can help us heal , I think . Dr. Raj Patel : Yeah . I ’ m just going to run with that probiotic idea . Because it ’ s true that we live in a world — and particularly in cities in the global north here — we live in a place where our gut microbiome has been seriously diluted . We may not have a window into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , but , I remember when I was a kid , we used to cycle around and used to get flies on our teeth , and the windshield would be completely smothered with the life that we were driving through . These days , that doesn ’ t happen . And the sort of extermination of life that we can see visibly outside is also happening inside us . And the way to fix that is not through a pill . Because even if you try and rewild your microbiome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay alive is through a relationship with the world outside . And you can ’ t just re-populate your internal microbiome and think , I ’ m all right , Jack . That ’ s not how life within us and external to us works . If the world around us is sick , then there ’ s no amount of biodiversity within us that will heal that world outside us and will sustain the life within us . So , I do think , just again , to jump on that idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who are very interested in transforming the way that we eat , are very excited about feeding our microbiome , and that ’ s the right impulse . But , what we ’ re trying to do in this book is take that impulse outside . It ’ s like , oh yeah , I ’ ve got to look after this . My microbiome is not just me , it ’ s a million different things . But , if that world of chaos stops at the boundary of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking full care of the world as it ’ s needed in order to be able to rewild ourselves back into a teeming and diverse world . Dr. Rupa Marya : Yes . And that ’ s beautifully said , Raj , because then the microbiome in the gut becomes a living reflection of a whole system of care and a whole system of relationships with the world around you . And so , that ’ s how you know , and that ’ s one of the things we talk about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know we ’ re making progress when we start to see our bodies become less inflamed . Ocean Robbins : Yeah . So , you talked about your patient who came to you having drunk or actually eaten fish from a river that was polluted and now was suffering from serious inflammation that eventually , I think , took her life . And it strikes me that one of the dangers of the natural health movement is that there ’ s a half-truth in that we are responsible for our own health outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them — what we eat and how we live has a massive impact on our well-being . But the other half of it is that we ’ re impacted by our environment , by our ecosystem , by forces outside of us as well . And yes , personal habits and personal choices will profoundly influence how we respond to pathogens , how resourceful and resilient our organism is in the face of assaults or challenges that it may face , but it ’ s not the whole story . A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in early childhood . And now here we are ; we don ’ t get to rewrite history . So , we do the best we can , of course , with what we ’ ve got , right ? And that ’ s back to the serenity prayer . Give me the serenity to accept the things I can ’ t change , the courage to change the things I can , and the wisdom to know the difference , right ? At the same time , I , like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we create the conditions where less kids are inheriting wounded biology and pathogens that they then have to suffer through and figure out how to detoxify or not throughout their entire lives . And a lot of that comes back to the collective well-being and the environment on the health of the ecosystems we inhabit . Are we living in toxins ? Are we breathing polluted air ? Are we around diverse , healthy soil ? Do we get to bring some of those microbes into our bodies ? Or do we live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hyper polluted ecosystems ? And the answers to these questions have a profound race and class dynamic to them . So , statistically , your likelihood of living in a healthy environment , in a safe environment , is different depending on your financial context and your ethnic background , and your nationality , right ? And this is one of the things I think you guys are highlighting so powerfully in your work is that if we really want to heal ourselves , we need to start to heal the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that that doesn ’ t show up equally for everybody . Dr. Raj Patel : You talked about how this is a problem for everyone . It ’ s certainly the case . And that ’ s something that is true also across races , for example , when it comes to conversations about class . Because one of the things that really surprised me in working with a group on this book is just how the story of inflammation works into our body . So , for instance , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States is that you are disproportionately exposed to things like payday loans . For folks who are lucky enough not to know what that is , it ’ s when you need $ 200 to make it through the end of the month , but then you have to pay $ 500 back within a couple of months . Now , those kinds of loans are so bad in terms of stress of repayment and the kinds of despair that people get driven into afterward , that if we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we were to just proscribe them and say , look , you can ’ t do payday loans anymore — then the suicide rate in the United States would drop by 2 % . And the fatal drug overdose poisoning rate would drop by 8.9 % . Dr. Raj Patel : Here ’ s a treatment . Here ’ s a medicine to help people who are on the frontlines . Doesn ’ t matter what race you are . If you are struggling with making ends meet… Payday loans are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take them off the table . But , understanding that actually the boundaries of medicine go beyond what the FDA approves or disapproves of and goes all the way from things like toxic financial policy , all the way to the food system , and meets in the middle . I think that part of the story that we ’ re telling here in Inflamed is a story about how the world of medicine , the world of food , the world of society are all conjoined in ways that we ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions between them . The Divisions Between Medicine and Food Ocean Robbins : Yes . So , we ’ re Food Revolution Network . We focus on food a lot . And I ’ ve often reflected that most doctors today act like food didn ’ t matter . And quite frankly , the food industry today acts like health didn ’ t matter , in many cases . Yet , the truth is that food is the foundation of health . And it should be the first line of defense against disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation . Why are there these divisions between medicine and food ? And is it just purely that doctors are trained to not think that way and the food industry is just trained to look out for profits , or are there deeper sources here around this division ? Dr. Rupa Marya : Well , this is what we dive into in the book , which is really the Enlightenment-era errors that have persisted in colonial capitalist society and have structured everything from the food system to our education system . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fractured from each other . And part of this has to do with how this land was colonized — that Europeans , when they came here , separated white male property people from everybody else . And those folks were civilized and all the rest of us were uncivilized . So , once you ’ re uncivilized , you ’ re able to be dominated and extracted from . And so , that mentality of extraction , which is pervasive in the industrialized food system , and even the softer , greener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these things are extractive . At their core , they ’ re extractive . They ’ re not based in systems of relationships . And so , that ’ s why doctors don ’ t know how to think about food , or even think about that your mind and body are actually one entity , that the separation of self and other is another fiction that we have to overcome . This is something that we really dive into in the book , is what we call the colonial cosmology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of our institutions in this society ; and how that way of thinking is actually a part of what ’ s making us sick . Because it ’ s doing precisely what you ’ re saying , Ocean : it ’ s doctors not understanding why it ’ s important to have nutrition , nutritious food , and where that plays a role . Dr. Rupa Marya : What we ’ re seeing in COVID… I just took care of a young , 37-year-old unvaccinated woman with severe COVID just yesterday in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were terrible . This is a young woman who ’ s a mother of three children , who has very poor nutritional markers . Because what ’ s available to the average person , the average working-class person , is not whole food ; it ’ s not nutritious food . And , it ’ s food that ’ s been laced with pesticides . You ’ ll have traces of these pesticides and dietary chemicals , which we also know impact the gut microbiome . And so , even if you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take the right probiotics , it won ’ t work in the face of the constant onslaught . And so that is what we ’ re talking about . How do we restructure our society and world so that onslaught stops , so that everyone can have the opportunity to be healthy ? Ocean Robbins : Yeah . There was a recent study , six countries , thousands of healthcare workers , and they were analyzing their diet and their COVID context . And they found that people who ate a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less risk of hospitalization than their peers who ate a more standard industrialized diet . Seventy-three percent reduction in risk of hospitalization . These healthcare workers were all exposed to COVID-19 in similar amounts . And then , we have other data from the CDC showing that 95 % of COVID-19 deaths in the United States have been linked to underlying comorbidities , which are , all of them , profoundly diet- and lifestyle-impacted . And — Dr. Rupa Marya : Yes . I want to say though , I just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we ’ re talking about obesity , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and these are the things I think you ’ re referring to — those things are diet-related , and they ’ re also related to the history of genocide of Indigenous people . They ’ re also related to how much your neighborhood is policed , and how terrorized you are by police . It ’ s related to trauma . It ’ s related to having your language ripped away from you . So it ’ s way more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right things , and are you living the right way ? Dr. Rupa Marya : Because , I just want to say that because for some people , that opportunity , even if they ate the best diet that they could and were exercising , they ’ ll never have that opportunity to counter those things . Ocean Robbins : And just to add a data point to that… As we know , life expectancy in the United States dropped in the first year of the pandemic by a year for the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Black population in the United States . So we ’ re seeing here that death rates were much higher amongst Black people , and also Indigenous and Latino communities than the white population . And that links to what you ’ re saying , the chronic inflammation that ’ s caused by so many other factors . Of course , there ’ s diet and lifestyle , but there ’ s also trauma and the impact of that trauma . And so , I appreciate you ’ re raising that larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s like we do all that we can personally , none of us wants to be a victim . At the same time , let ’ s look at the systemic dynamics that do victimize some people , quite frankly , in serious ways . Raj , did you want to add to this too ? Dr. Raj Patel : Yes . The way that the food industry behaves is also worth flagging here . A report came out , a leaked report from within Nestle , pointing out the vast majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t meet a basic definition of being healthy . Again , there ’ s a rhythm to the patterns of exposure to unhealthy food when the food industry systematically targets low-income communities and communities of people of color with the least healthy food . So , it ’ s not an accident that the food industry is targeting certain kinds of neighborhoods , certain kinds of communities for advertising , for example . And , the lack of accident there has everything to do with , again , the damaging consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , again , premised as Rupa was saying , on a racist and exploitative and genocidal history . Just to give some numbers here . In 2019 , Americans spent $ 1.1 trillion on food . Just a very limited calculation of the damage caused by the food system through those purchases set the number at around $ 2.1 trillion . So $ 1.1 trillion spent , $ 2.1 trillion of damage , and the majority of that was precisely in the generation of these comorbidities , again , which are patterned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very targeted way that follows the contours of power in society . And so , now we ’ re all familiar with comorbidities , but we all ought to become a bit more familiar with the mechanisms through which they are projected into our bodies by these large corporations . And I don ’ t care how conscious they pretend to be . When you ’ ve got Nestle saying , “ We ’ re trying to take some sugar out of our food , ” that ’ s — as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the edges , when essentially their business model depends on the production of externalities that will generate , and as they know full well , the death , in particular , of communities of people of color and low-income communities . Ocean Robbins : Yeah . Okay . So , some of our viewers right now might be saying , “ This is really heavy stuff. ” When you ’ re saying the dominant systems that we depend on to feed families are morally bankrupt and are causing this harm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even greener versions are warmer and fuzzier , but they ’ re still fundamentally connected to the same extractive systems that are fueling a lot of the crises , what can we do about it ? Personally and collectively , what ’ s the prescription here ? The Need for Deep Medicine Dr. Rupa Marya : Well , the prescription is deep medicine , Ocean . And I ’ m happy to tell you about a project we ’ re doing as a model that could be replicated all over this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we started an organization called The Deep Medicine Circle . We are a collective of non-Indigenous and Indigenous people working together to advance systems of farming that prioritize Indigenous principles of earth care and people care . We are working on re-matriating , returning 38 acres of land to the Ramaytush Ohlone here , the original people of the San Francisco Peninsula . And we ’ re working under their leadership to create food to give away to people oppressed by hunger in the city . So we ’ re in the peri-urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes south of San Francisco . All the food that we ’ ll be growing will be , I call it morganic because it ’ s not just organic . But we ’ re working on improving soil biodiversity . We are working on area median income wages for our farmers so that they ’ re employed and healthy . And they ’ re also being valued for the work of stewardship that they ’ re doing for the soil and for the food . And then that food is just liberated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to people whose gut microbiome needs it the most . And then we see how that shifts our narratives of health and wellness . So , we can flip the food system on its head and prioritize care , or we could keep it as it is and try to eke out a profit as we try to do these things . The profit motive of the food industry , as with the healthcare industry — as we ’ re watching in the United States — is always going to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what we need right now is care . We need care and repair of the damage that ’ s been done to our soils , to our water , and to our Indigenous people . The IPCC report on climate change did say that Indigenous people and their systems of knowledge are critical to addressing climate change throughout the world . So it ’ s a great time to give land back , give all the land back , and start working under Indigenous people ’ s understandings of how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I know that might sound like , “ Whoa , how do you do that ? ” Well , you do it in little bits , and you do it in big bits , and it ’ s happening right now . There are many projects all over Turtle Island , all over this land , and all over the world , frankly , where people are starting and have been building these movements of peasant farmers and small to medium farmers , who ’ ve always fed , always created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planet Earth . So that ’ s reassuring , and it ’ s exciting . What do you think , Raj ? Dr. Raj Patel : I think people should give to the Deep Medicine Circle of which I am a treasurer and , therefore , I need to declare an interest . But I do think that there are… Part of the debilitating moment here is , the reason this feels so big and unwieldy is because we ’ ve been so conditioned into our powerlessness , thinking that the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by shopping and really spending quite a lot of money on the right probiotic . And if that ’ s what we think , really the only way that we can save the world is through our shopping habits , we let go of perhaps the most important levers of change that we have , which is our relationships with one another and the rest of the web of life . And , to reconnect to that is , it can feel like some sort of woke duty . And for those folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , “ Look , I get it that there are things wrong with the world , but there ’ s so much to do. ” The one way to frame it is to feel it as a duty of just suffering and of abnegation . But the other way , and I think possibly the better , in fact , definitely , the better and the more correct way of understanding this is a duty of liberation . And the reason it feels so difficult is that ’ s the sort of voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerless and overwhelmed by everything as opposed to ready for transformation and change . And the more we ’ re in the readiness for transformation and change space , the happier we ’ re going to be because ultimately changes are coming . We ’ ve seen what climate change is doing , and it ’ s only getting worse as well we know . So why not lean into the need for change and understand it as a liberation rather than as a kind of retreat into a smaller , shallow life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . Dr. Rupa Marya : And that ’ s really the space of the imagination . I think what we ’ re talking about here is it ’ s so sad that arts funding has been cut so much in school because so much of this work is the act of imagining new ways of being together that we ’ ve never actually had an opportunity to ever experience on a large social scale . What does that look like ? What does it feel like to escape from the social structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ’ ve internalized ? And we ’ ve been unwitting recreators of that violence . It ’ s an opportunity to open up that consciousness and step through another door . And through that , the richness of relationships is so exciting and actually invigorates new possibilities , new economies , new ways of carrying out our daily living , which is exciting . Ocean Robbins : Yeah . Thank you for that . I think that many of us feel , deep in our bones , that the world we ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us anymore . So many people feel this longing for another way of living , feel a sense of isolation and loneliness , feel a sense of disconnection , and feel as if we ’ re stuck in a rat race , so to speak — trying to survive and win a race that even if we win it , are we really going to be happy ? Even people who succeed at the top of the heap often feel deeply lonely and bereft inside like , “ I ’ ve got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ” And then so many other people feel like if they could just get a little higher on the ladder , then they ’ d be okay . Meanwhile , they ’ re struggling just to survive . And so many of us are wondering , “ Is there something more ? Is there something deeper ? ” And the notion that the breakdown of established systems and institutions and even ecosystems might open the opportunity for some kind of a breakthrough to another way of living in harmony with our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a community , rather than just as a way to try to get to the top , is liberating I think . To something… It ’ s humanizing in the deepest sense . And so , now I really want to thank both of you for shining such a brilliant light on what ’ s possible , for sharing , in very sobering terms , what we ’ re up against and the costs of the status quo . Because we ’ ve got to face that , I think , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As long as it ’ s sort of okay , we ’ d rather take what ’ s tolerable to the unknown sometimes . But when we realize how broken things are , and , in fact , maybe they ’ re not broken , maybe they ’ re designed for something that isn ’ t what we want to be designed for , then we start to realize , wow , what else is possible ? And you ’ re helping shine that light and the notion that we could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we could contribute to a healthier and happier world is a beautiful one . So , I thank you both . Any closing words you ’ d like to share from our time today ? Dr. Rupa Marya : One of the scholars we talked to , Sam Grey , who is just so amazing , she brought up this concept of being orphaned — that we ’ ve all been orphaned from our mother . I remember she said that , and it just really hit my heart . Like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I born here in Ohlone territory ? Why is Raj ? Where have we been dragged about from our families , these diasporas , these refugees of colonial terror ? ” We ’ ve all been separated from our homelands . The people who ’ ve been colonized here . We ’ ve all been cut off . So what we must do is heal and repair those connections wherever we are . And that really is contending with these systems of domination that put us in places of really illegitimate privilege , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overturn . And what wealth of relationship comes on the other end of that . It ’ s tremendously exciting . I can tell you , I ’ m a songwriter . And this work I ’ m doing right now with Deep Medicine Circle is the opera of my life — the most beautiful symphony I ’ ve ever heard . And so , I invite everyone to find that work in their own orphanhood . It ’ s time for us all to come home . And so , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing work . It ’ s deep work . It ’ s confronting trauma . It ’ s hard work . And if we all do it together , it can be a beautiful journey . Dr. Raj Patel : I couldn ’ t say it better than that . So I… Yeah . I think this work of care for one another and recognizing how big the community is that ’ s caring for us and for whom we can care is just a revelation . And it ’ s so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think ensuring that we all care so that we can all consume fairly , I think , is definitely the message we ’ ve got in Inflamed . And I ’ m just very grateful to have written it with Rupa . And Ocean , that you ’ ve invited us here and that you ’ ve spent so much time with the book and with its messages . It ’ s a privilege .

In recent decades , one of the political West ’ s favorite strategies have been the so-called “ decapitation strikes ” against various countries or non-state actors . One of the first examples of this happened in the 1990s in Europe , during the US aggression against Yugoslavia . At the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slobodan Milosevic . In complete disregard for the safety of his family , NATO destroyed Milosevic ’ s mansions and residencies , causing casualties among civilians in the process . Although the attacks failed , the Serb/Yugoslav leader was still deposed and later imprisoned in the aftermath of a successful NATO-orchestrated coup . A similar approach was used against Saddam Hussein in Iraq . These attacks failed , but after the US-led invasion forces occupied most of the country , he was taken prisoner by American troops and after a show trial by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed in 2006 . A very similar fate awaited the leader of Libya , Muammar Gaddafi , who was also directly targeted during the 2011 NATO aggression on Libya . Unlike Saddam Hussein , Gaddafi never got a show trial , but was instead brutally killed by a mob . Again , in both cases , NATO strikes on the residencies of both leaders resulted in the deaths of their immediate family members and any civilians in their vicinity . It should be noted that these decapitation strikes brought mixed results . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure of the targeted country or organization , the ensuing chaos and power vacuum were usually filled by someone with little regard for meaningful dialogue and brought even more suffering to the people of the affected country , causing decades of instability and factionalism . Such strikes were always conducted with impunity , as the targeted countries had no means to respond . It seems this has become such a favorite strategy in the Pentagon , that the US simply forgot that certain countries can “ return the favor ” , so now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global powers such as Russia . For months , in complete disregard of reality , some US officials have been calling for the elimination of Russian leadership . Threatening a country incapable of retaliating is one thing , despite how morally and legally reprehensible that is , but threatening a country whose response could quite literally end the world is a clear indicator of just how detached the US establishment has become . And yet , this doesn ’ t stop the said officials from continued calls for decapitation strikes against Russia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petraeus , or direct calls for Putin ’ s assassination by both former US National Security Advisor John Bolton and a sitting US senator Lindsey Graham . The comments by these US officials inevitably caught Russia ’ s attention , including its Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov . In an interview with Russia ’ s TASS news agency published on Tuesday , he condemned that Washington DC obviously doesn ’ t rule out the assassination of President Vladimir Putin . The foreign minister noted that “ some unnamed officials from the Pentagon actually threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Kremlin… What we are talking about is the threat of the physical elimination of the head of the Russian state. ” Moscow ’ s top diplomat cautioned against such a line of thinking . “ If such ideas are actually being nourished by someone , this someone should think very carefully about the possible consequences of such plans , ” Lavrov warned . His comments were most likely directed at a late September article by Newsweek , when several Pentagon officials suggested a “ decapitation strike to kill Putin in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Putin stated that Moscow would “ use all means necessary to defend Russia and its people ” . As per usual , the Western mainstream propaganda machine immediately ( and deliberately ) took the Russian president ’ s words out of context and suggested that the remarks are “ a clear sign ” of Moscow ’ s planned usage of thermonuclear weapons . However , Russia has repeatedly stated that it doesn ’ t plan to deploy any of the weapons of mass destruction from its massive arsenal . Lavrov also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and satellite states are openly embracing this confrontational approach . “ They seem to have gone completely beyond the bounds of decency , ” he said , referring to a statement by former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss , who “ without a shadow of a doubt declared during the election debates that she was quite ready to order a nuclear strike. ” Russia ’ s top diplomat once again cautioned against such statements , but also recalled that they ’ re even worse in the case of the Neo-Nazi junta . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime ’ s provocations that go off the chart . Volodymyr Zelensky went as far as to demand preventive nuclear strikes by NATO countries on Russia . This is also beyond the bounds of what is acceptable , ” he warned . Indeed , such rhetoric is quite disturbing , to say the least . Given how heavily armed the global powers are , calls for decapitation strikes or assassinations of any of their leaders are extremely dangerous . However , such statements aren ’ t coming from Moscow or Beijing , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such actions . Unfortunately , this doesn ’ t seem to be the case in Washington DC , where a complete lack of etiquette ( diplomatic or otherwise ) seems to have become the norm . How exactly this could affect the world remains to be seen , as Russia is exercising restraint for the time being . This approach is the only sensible one , but the issue is that the political West often sees it as a sign of “ weakness ” .

"Manchester, England CNN — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak got up to speak from a podium bearing the words “Long-Term Decisions for a Brighter Future” – the slogan for this year’s Conservative Party conference. But over the past three days on the fringes of the governing party’s annual meeting, members have been planning their own long-term future – and in some cases for one that doesn’t involve him. This year’s gathering, in Manchester, a historic city that was formerly the industrial powerhouse of northern England, held extra significance as it is likely the last to take place before the next general election. It was a golden opportunity for Sunak to unite his party after the battering his party’s credibility took from his two immediate predecessors – the scandal-hit era of Boris Johnson and the economic tumult of Liz Truss."
""""""" The Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) and the Veterans Benefits Administration ( VBA ) will be adding staff to keep up with Veterans 's claims made through the recently-passed bill to expand benefits for veterans exposed to toxins during their military service . The VA is set to start processing Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics ( PACT ) Act claims on January 1 , 2023 . The PACT Act was created with the goal of expanding access to care and benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) to the 3.5 million veterans who served after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack and were exposed to toxic burn pits . Since it was passed in August , there have been many concerns about how the VA will make a smooth transition to implement the law without disrupting the department 's other services . Joshua Jacobs , senior advisor performing the delegable duties of the Under Secretary for Benefits of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs , said that hiring was a key part of the VA 's plan to accommodate the expected increase in benefits claimed through the PACT Act , during a hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Affairs . `` We are focused on hiring efforts up and down the organization , '' said Jacobs . `` VBA has been preparing for PACT Act implementation since last year , hiring approximately 2,000 additional employees . '' Jacobs also said that the VBA plans to hire more people soon , thanks to the toxic exposure fund created in the PACT Act . `` In the next few months thanks to the toxic exposure fund we anticipate adding almost nineteen hundred more employees to our roles , '' said Jacobs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to ramp up for when PACT Act benefits start being processed , claims processors are currently required to work mandatory overtime . During the hearing , some lawmakers expressed concerns that the VA 's increased staff and mandatory overtime would n't be enough to accommodate the expected rise in claims . `` Unfortunately , you know many of these new hires wo n't be able to put a dent in backlog until they are fully trained , '' said ranking member of the committee Rep. Mike Bost ( R-Ill. ) . `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead to employee burnout . '' Jacobs said that the VA started training new employees on Monday . The VA is working on creating a `` train the trainer '' model , where experts in their compensation service office train a handful of staff in 56 regional offices , and those staff then assist in training new staff . When asked how long mandatory overtime would be required for claims processors , Jacobs said the move would last until at least the end of this fiscal year . `` Right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] through the fiscal year , '' said Jacobs . `` We realize it is not a sustainable model . '' In addition to hiring new staff , the VA also plans to use money from the toxic exposure fund created by the PACT Act to automate certain parts of the claims processing process to help claims processors make more timely decisions . However , automation is still in the pilot phase . Despite still being in the early stages of development , Jacobs said the technology is promising . `` These tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to several days for the small number of claims that have leveraged this technology at one of our eight pilot sites , '' said Jacobs . Currently , automation efforts are dependent on 4 vendors , and Deputy Under Secretary for Disability Assistance at the Veterans Benefits Administration Robert T. Reynolds said the department plans to expand automation soon . We 've leveraging probably 4 vendors or so that are all working in concert together based on their specialty of what they bring , '' Reynolds said . `` This fiscal year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the street for more IT capabilities . '' Jacobs said that the average time it takes the VA to process a benefits claim is 125 days . The VA currently categorizes any claim that takes more than 125 days to process as part of their backlog . `` Right now , we have average days pending is 106 days and average days to complete is 125 , '' said Jacobs . `` What the department has defined historically as the back log is 125 days to complete a claim , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is defined as being in the backlog . '' Rep. Jack Bergman ( R-Mich. ) expressed frustration with the VA not being able to process benefits claims faster . `` The men and women who we are seeking to serve through the money we allocated , appropriated to you all to get the job done , they had a sense of urgency in their lives , '' said Bergman . `` Is there a sense of urgency , can you move the ball faster here , because the clock ticks .

"Strong result for socialists in University of Sydney student elections Socialists won the highest vote of any political faction contesting the University of Sydney Students’ Representative Council elections in September. Left Action, the ticket organised by Socialist Alternative club members, received 23.88 percent of the formal votes cast, and nine of its candidates have been elected as representatives in a 37-seat council. This comes off the back of last year’s result, when Left Action also won close to a quarter of the vote. For years, the socialists came up against large campus election machines organised by student politicians in major parties, as well as apolitical or right-wing bloc votes from the colleges or clubs and societies. We could eke out only a small minority on the council. Now, socialist activists are a leading force in the SRC."
""""""" If you are looking for a six-figure job that focuses on beating down alternative voices when it comes to election integrity , Democratic Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut might have a job for you . The Daily Mail gives us the details on this new lucrative opportunity courtesy of the Connecticut taxpayers .

The official job title will be security analyst , and the individual will be expected to combat misinformation ‘ on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times first reported . Their job will be to identify and flag information that they think may significantly disrupt election activities , and to boost the public ’ s confidence in the fairness and accuracy of results .

Funny how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s say , 2020 . It ’ s strange how gullible the Left thinks Americans are these days . The belief seems to be that we lack any kind of discernment to know what kind of schemes they think up . This scheme that Lamont and the Secretary of State are cooking up is a prime example . It is all part of a massive campaign against alleged misinformation funded by Democrat Governor Ned Lamont , and overseen by Secretary of the State Denise Merrill . Merril , who has joined other state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education effort , called misinformation ‘ the issue of our lifetime. ’ The state ’ s misinformation officer will target certain platforms , such as websites Gettr , Rumble and 4Chan , and more commonly used platforms such as Facebook and Twitter , the New York Times reported .

The purpose of which is to convince voters that the only trusted source for election information are coming from the very people trying to stay in office for one more term . Sounds an awful lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house doesn ’ t it ? Things get even worse . Turns out that the governor is dumping millions of taxpayer dollars to accomplish his agenda . The governor and his Secretary of State are saying all of the right things to try and convince voters that this is in their best interests . After all , election integrity is important . It ’ s interesting though that while they admit the existence of foreign actors manipulating elections and are using it to justify all this spending , they are adamant that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Funny how that works for democrats . That leads many people to ask the question , why are Democrats in CT so intent on suppressing outside voices when it comes to their elections ? Well , it may have to do with a troubling trend that analysts are noticing .

With the exception of 2020 ( which who can really be sure the numbers are accurate ) , Republicans have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite what mainstream media would have us believe , it wasn ’ t too long ago that Connecticut consistently voted for Republican candidates .

With investigations regarding election tampering heating up all across the nation , it seems logical that Democrats would be in a rush to cover their tracks while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While small , this state is crucial moving forward . Having a state like CT go red , in races as tight as they have been , could prove catastrophic for the Left ’ s agenda .

Her tombstone was inscribed in Syriac , an Aramaic dialect . She was one of 114 people buried there during those two years—who accounted for one quarter of all the cemetery ’ s burials while it was in operation from 1245 to 1345 . Bačaq ’ s tombstone does not mention a cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : mawtānā , or pestilence . Today it is called plague . Bačaq ’ s teeth , as well as those of another woman buried nearby , have now yielded genomic evidence of what researchers suggest is the ancestral strain of the Yersinia pestis bacterium responsible for the 14th-century Black Death pandemic , according to a study published on Wednesday in Nature . The paper also points to this region as the source of that notorious plague , which killed at least an estimated 30 to 60 percent of Europe ’ s population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions in Asia have been proposed as the origin of this second plague pandemic—the first being the sixth-century Justinian plague , which historian Procopius claimed killed 10,000 people a day in Constantinople and weakened the Eastern Roman Empire . But virtually all of the genetic and historical data on the second plague has so far come from Europe , says paleontologist and study co-author Maria Spyrou of Germany ’ s University of Tübingen . “ It gave us a very sort of Eurocentric focus on what really happened , ” she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are “ the only archaeological evidence that we know of that is present outside of western Eurasia or outside of Europe. ” The study analyzed the teeth of five women and two men whom archaeologist Nikolay Pantusov exhumed in the late 19th century from the cemetery in Kara-Djigach and another in the village of Burana , about 35 miles east . Their skulls had been stored in the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography ( Kunstkamera ) in Saint Petersburg , Russia . The researchers extracted Y. pestis DNA from tissues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth and sequenced the genomes of those pathogens , which were found to be identical . The teeth of a woman who died in her 50s also revealed Y. pestis DNA , but it was too degraded for a high-quality genomic reconstruction , and no plague DNA was recovered from the teeth of the other individuals . Next , the scientists compared the recovered Y. pestis strain with 203 modern and 47 historical genomes of the species . The strain they found appears to be the ancestor of Y. pestis strains that evolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event , which has long been thought to be linked to the beginning of the second pandemic . These strains have been recorded from the remains of plague victims in Europe , and they are found across the world even today in generally less virulent forms . Because the newly recovered strain resembles modern ones found in animals in the region , Spyrou and her colleagues suggest it originated in the nearby Tian Shan mountain region on the border of Kyrgyzstan and China , when the bacterium jumped from rodent hosts—likely marmots—to humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the strain they reconstruct and analyze is convincingly ancestral ” to Western European strains that date from later during the Black Death , says Hendrik Poinar , a biologist who studies ancient DNA at McMaster University in Ontario .

If it was widespread before and up to 1338 , he says , it might not be the only basal strain of the second pandemic circulating—and thus could obscure the pandemic ’ s true origins . The study ’ s team also sequenced the genomes of the seven people and found they were most similar to present-day Eurasian populations . But that does not mean they were homogenous . The variety of coins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shells , precious stones and metals of often distant origin found in some graves speak to the people ’ s ethnic and geographical diversity—and sometimes their wealth . So do the inscriptions on their tombstones , which give their origins as China , Mongolia and Armenia , among other places .

"On Saturday, state representative Carl Sherman announced the long-awaited start of his U.S. Senate campaign against Ted Cruz, the conservative firebrand whom liberals love to hate. Sherman, a 57-year-old Church of Christ pastor from the Dallas County city of DeSoto, is the third prominent Democrat to throw his hat in the ring, following Dallas-area congressman Colin Allred and state senator Roland Gutierrez, of San Antonio. All of the Democrats in the race are hoping that one of them can finish what former U.S. congressman Beto O’Rourke started in 2018, when he electrified the Democratic grass roots and came within 3 percentage points of ousting Cruz. But that’s no easy feat: at its core, Texas is still a Republican-leaning state that will require a strong Democratic candidate to win. Of course, since entering the Legislature, Sherman has won all of his elections pretty handily, but it’s still not clear whether he’s the person Democrats need to unseat Cruz. Without uttering Cruz’s name, Sherman, in his campaign announcement, said he was running to defend all Texans whose rights are “under assault,” including women, members of underrepresented ethnic groups, and the LGBTQ community. “We have a nation of leaders who have forgotten the least of these,” the pastor said, referencing Jesus’s exhortation in Matthew 25 to serve those in need. “What good are you if you will not concern yourself with those who God is concerned about?” Sherman served two terms as mayor of DeSoto in the 2010s, the first Black mayor of the town. And, in 2018, he ran for the state House. Sherman, a well-known figure in South Dallas, rode the endorsements of then–Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings; state senator Royce West, who represents the city; and a handful of DeSoto’s then–city council members. Still, he didn’t win outright, finishing second in a four-way Democratic primary and ultimately prevailing in the subsequent runoff election. Now Sherman represents one of safest Democratic seats in the Texas Legislature. Helen Giddings, Sherman’s predecessor, won decisively in every election for which she ran since 1992."

Playbook: How to make sense of those new Biden-Trump polls Presented by With help from Eli Okun and Garrett Ross
"The Cozen Lens What role the United States should play in today’s unstable world is a legitimate debate to have, but to be able to provide any form of leadership abroad, the US needs to be able to demonstrate a certain level of governance and stability at home. Since House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was ousted from his post two weeks ago, House Republicans have been chasing their tails in search of a new speaker that can sufficiently unite the caucus. But with the Senate returning from recess today and looking to pass at least ostensibly time-sensitive “must pass” legislation, the various House GOP factions’ pain thresholds will be tested in a way that they haven’t been yet."
"The permanent bureaucracy and its backers are having conniptions over Project 2025, an endeavor to ensure the next conservative president is ready to govern from day one. Truth to tell, the denizens of the permanent state are not wrong to fret. Those of us working on this project intend to make sure that the deep state can no longer throttle conservative governance through administrative sabotage. This is also true for the institution that reflects the views, biases, and mores of the permanent state rather than the public itself: public broadcasting. Project 2025 aims to make sure that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) ceases to receive public funding, so conservative taxpayers are no longer forced to pay for NPR and PBS, which CPB funds. As Thomas Jefferson put it, “To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagations of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.”"

"Debates inescapably animate the American election circus, watched more for gaffes and missteps than genuine insight into presidential aspirants. In August, however, the Republican presidential candidates’ debate detoured from the usual litany of empty soundbites into something darker: a collective dismissal of reality. When the eight hopefuls for the presidential nomination were asked to raise their hands if they believed in the reality of human-mediated global warming, every one declined to do so. One candidate, biotech entrepreneur and fossil-fuel stock peddler Vivek Ramaswamy, went even further, slamming the “climate change agenda” as a hoax. Despite the bluster of the Republican candidates, the incontrovertible fact remains that anthropogenic climate change is real. As swathes of the world swelter and burn and flood, the folly displayed at the debate makes it critical we understand why so many persist in denying reality."
"After three very public failures in balloting before the full House, his end came quietly, by secret ballot, in a basement meeting with his fellow House Republicans. It is a fate that will make him a martyr for the party's right wing, which will view his defeat as further evidence of a party establishment that is insufficiently dedicated to conservative values."

"By Matija Šeri? Often, individual natural resources have a great influence on the development of humanity. Everyone will immediately remember oil and gas, the use of which fundamentally changed the world, however, there are other commodities that have had a decisive impact on global political, economic and social development. One of those goods is coffee. Over the past centuries, coffee has become the favorite drink of millions of people. The influence of coffee is not limited to the food industry and catering, but is much broader. Drinking coffee has become an indispensable part of the daily life of millions, but also a key factor in the historical development of societies. From its humble beginnings in the Ethiopian highlands to a global ultra-popular product, coffee’s impact is immense. In its centuries-long journey to become a global beverage, coffee was a tool to build and dismantle empires and fuel the industrial revolution. And sometimes it was the driving force behind exploiting people, encouraging slavery, and fueling civil wars."

In studies of autoimmune diseases male microchimerism is most often attributed to the previous birth of a son . OBJECTIVE : To determine the frequency of male microchimerism in healthy women or women with systemic sclerosis who had never given birth to a son .

Although two women with male DNA had an induced abortion , most had no history of spontaneous or induced abortion ( either systemic sclerosis or healthy ) . CONCLUSIONS : Microchimerism with male DNA can be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth to a son . Thus sources other than a male birth must be considered when male DNA is used to measure microchimerism .

As a phalanx of security guards surrounded the man—who shouted “democracy first”—dragging him from the stage, Starmer turned to the assembled delegates and the world’s media, declaring, “Protest or power: that’s why we changed our party”. His was a declaration of authoritarianism, referencing the party’s mass frame-up and ruthless purge of left-wing members, a statement that would be welcomed by dictators everywhere.

"As a key supporter of Ukraine, the largest post-communist country in the European Union, and a staunch U.S. ally, Poland’s October 15 parliamentary elections will have far-reaching consequences. Poles will choose between four more years of a populist government accused of several violations of the rule of law, undermining the EU, and xenophobic policies since it first came to office in 2015, or its long-standing opposition, and the chance for Poland to restore its democratic institutions and its international reputation. Regardless of the outcome, Polish politics will remain polarized. The incumbent Law and Justice party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwo??, PiS) gained power in 2015 on promises of “good change” and appeals to moderation. Its controversial chair, Jaros?aw Kaczy?ski, the country’s prime minister from 2006 to 2007, did not run for a leadership position, relying instead on more palatable proxies. It was only after PiS gained power that the party suborned the judiciary, used government media as a propaganda mouthpiece while limiting the free media, and eroded independent institutions of monitoring, oversight, and accountability. It has also built a loyal constituency of older, more rural, more conservative voters that brought the party to power in 2015 and reelected it in 2019. The campaign"

"Biden Admin. Climate Plan: Turning Activists Into Bureaucrats On Taxpayer Dime ‘While the Administration works overtime to freeze sensible development like energy pipelines, its latest initiative would essentially set up a taxpayer-funded pipeline for turning climate activists into climate bureaucrats’ WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) delivered the following remarks today on the Senate floor regarding left-wing climate policy:"
"In 1969 a young aide in the Nixon White House, 28-year-old Kevin Phillips, published “The Emerging Republican Majority.” Phillips had worked as a strategist on Richard Nixon’s 1968 campaign, the experience of which supplied much of the material for his book. His argument was straightforward: Nixon’s victory wasn’t just a momentary triumph but the beginning of an epochal shift in American politics, fueled by a latent conservatism among many members of the white middle class. These voters were repulsed, Phillips wrote, by the Democratic Party’s “ambitious social programming and inability to handle the urban and Negro revolutions.” The latter point was key. “The principal force which broke up the Democratic (New Deal) coalition is the Negro socioeconomic revolution and liberal Democratic ideological inability to cope with it,” Phillips declared. “The Democratic Party fell victim to the ideological impetus of a liberalism which had carried it beyond programs taxing the few for the benefit of the many (the New Deal) to programs taxing the many on behalf of the few (the Great Society).”"

He has probed how social media and other factors exploit the weak spots of our human need to belong—and exclude—leading to the spread of false information that has been so prevalent before November ’ s tipping-point elections . An associate professor of psychology and neural science at New York University , Van Bavel spoke with Scientific American about who is most vulnerable to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do to avoid becoming victims of those who benefit from the ecosystem of misinformation . [ An edited transcript of the interview follows . ] How does misinformation spread and why ? And how is it having an impact in the current political environment ? Social media users are scrolling through about 300 feet of news feed a day . That is a lot . Misinformation tends to be designed to be attention-grabbing , more emotionally loaded or embedded with morality or identity , so it captures our attention in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share is that it is interesting or relevant or signals our affiliation with our political leader or party . A lot of it is salacious allegations of affairs or corruption . These types of messages can be really damaging to a candidate as they spread widely . A surprising data point in the 2016 election data was that older people spread misinformation [ more than ] young people [ do ] . Older people are more polarized and more committed to identities , and often they arguably are not as savvy on social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been using it a lot . Older people vote at about twice the rate of young people in midterms . What are some factors in the success of viral misinformation ? It ’ s a combination of things . In structural terms , the U.S. is more polarized than it ’ s been in 20 years , more driven by out-group hate than by in-group love . Then you have political leaders . During the pandemic , it was [ Donald ] Trump who downplayed the risks of the pandemic during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a risk , so he clearly knew , but he was running for reelection and didn ’ t want to damage the economy and have people blame him for it . And then [ you have ] the set of people around them , political elites . There is a big role of political elites—they give cues to people about what to believe and whom to trust . And it ’ s kind of a trickle down , [ starting with ] senators who are politically active on social media or Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scrolling and sharing or rewteeting it or mentioning it to a friend or e-mailing it . People tend to get news from family and friends they trust more because if you see it from a family member , it seems more trustworthy . It 's not all the leaders who are sources of the misinformation . Trump was retweeting conspiracy theories and misinformation from his followers , and he would amplify it if it was favorable to him . Conspiracy theorists are often creative in generating stories , and that trickles up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is definitely an ecosystem and vicious cycles , where the more [ misinformation is ] shared , the more incentive for people to share and get monetized , get invited onto Fox News . There are all kinds of incentive structures embedded in this . What platforms are the likeliest contenders for the best incubators of misinformation ? TikTok is a big one , although [ the company ] is trying to update its policies to manage misinformation . Facebook probably has more people online than Twitter . There is a big study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID information from Facebook had the greatest levels of vaccine hesitancy even versus getting it from Fox News . Those data suggest that Facebook is , if anything , a big risk factor where most people are getting news . How do the parties responsible for generating misinformation decide on what to disseminate ? The misinformation that catches on and spreads is stuff that connects to themes that people have already heard or believe . One from the last election was “ stop the steal , ” the [ false ] notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic , there were various conspiracy theories or misinformation about every stage of the pandemic , everything from vaccines and how they affect kids to masks . And a lot was spread in the effort of discrediting the health risks the pandemic posed . What surprises might be on the horizon for the midterms ? It ’ s a little harder to predict than a presidential election . Most information is targeted to specific candidates , probably in the most contested senate races , such as Georgia and Pennsylvania . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races or maybe some swing districts in Congress . That is where the architects of misinformation want to shake things up . A small number of people tend to be very politically extreme . Most are people on the right , so Republican political actors . And you can imagine that there would be some misinformation from the left as well . It tends not to be spread as widely . The people spreading [ misinformation ] are the usual suspects—Alex Jones , Roger Stone . It tends to generate from a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are politically aligned . What can people do to be less vulnerable to influences from these misinformation campaigns ? We need to become more skeptical about information that comes from our own groups , our political leaders . I ’ ve shared maybe two or three pieces of misinformation . One was a parody , and I didn ’ t realize it because it kind of aligned with something in the zeitgeist , with my beliefs and identity . Friends on social media corrected me , and I immediately felt humiliated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I were to start sharing a lot of information like that from Alex Jones , I ’ d stop getting invited to conferences . We need norms around correcting one another and not have to do it all ourselves . That is the whole thing with science—peer review : scholars come along after and point out our errors . We [ scientists ] live in a community that helps us get smarter over time . You want to embed yourself in communities and make that normative , not to get defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another [ tactic ] is “ prebunking , ” getting the facts out before misinformation spreads too widely . That acts like a vaccine . Get an inoculation , and the brain has antibodies to this misinformation so that when you encounter it in the wild , your brain can understand that you ’ re being manipulated and counterargue it . That seems to make more people more skeptical overall . Online there is a really cool game , the Bad News Game , that teaches how [ misinformation spreads ] and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ the game ] helps people . Journalists have a role to identify misinformation that ’ s likely to spread in this cycle , something that will piggyback on “ stop the steal ” or “ fake ballot ” allegations . I ’ d encourage journalists to get out accurate information about how people are likely to be manipulated based on the last election and give people resources or places they can go to get higher-quality information on these issues . How does someone with an entrenched belief react to fact-checks ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the impact they have in studies was really small , compared with that of partisan identity . [ Some of ] the time , [ fact-checking ] actually seemed to backfire . People got more entrenched mostly if something got fact-checked by the other side , and people who had this backfire effect really identified with a particular group . People who drive around in a pickup with five Trump flags or a car with stickers all over it with every single liberal cause they support are more susceptible to this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t make it an essential part of their identity seem to be less susceptible to getting entrenched . I think that this is going to be a big issue . It ’ s not going away ; it ’ s only getting bigger . And it ’ s not just the issue of individuals needing to be more savvy . It ’ s that we are embedded in systems that are rewarding misinformation spreaders with economic things . Alex Jones is a good test case . He is making so much every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People don ’ t like being manipulated and need a greater understanding of the fact that they are being manipulated by people profiting off of these lies .

"In 2023, a number of serious challenges have come to the fore in Canada. There are the extreme wildfires that have received global attention. The country might be sitting on the biggest housing bubble in history. Inflation remains persistent while interest rates threaten a recession. Household debt has continued to grow and has surpassed 100 percent of GDP, the highest in the G7. And to top it all off, relations with the world’s two most populous countries (and its two largest sources of immigrants) have cratered over allegations of foreign interference including an assassination. So, what do some in the political class think Canadians now need? You guessed it, yet another political party. Of course, this is not an endeavor aimed at establishing a viable socialist party to represent the interests of working people. Instead, it’s the brainchild of members of the power elite who feel that the centrist Liberal Party isn’t centrist enough and the Conservative Party is too crude. It is not an effort to give color to the political spectrum; it is an attempt to replace anemic gray with anemic gray and hope that the newness of the packaging will appeal to voters. On September 20, the Canadian Future Party (CFP) was unveiled. In recent years, there has been growing talk of a new centrist party, with momentum building notably since Pierre Poilievre assumed leadership of the Conservative Party. A group called Centre Ice Canadians (formerly Centre Ice Conservatives) has led the charge. The group was founded by Rick Peterson, an investment banker based in Edmonton who ran in the 2017 Conservative Party leadership election and finished twelfth out of fourteen. Underwhelming Party Brass One might assume that Peterson’s dismal track record and meager level of support would be enough to undermine the prospects of the CFP, but he is not alone. Remarkably, the aspirant party’s interim leader, Dominic Cardy, manages to rival Peterson’s lackluster credentials. It is hard to think of a Canadian politician with such ambition who has accomplished so little. Cardy began his political journey in the New Democratic Party (NDP). In the early 2000s — at a time when the NDP was in an identity crisis — Cardy, a Tony Blair admirer, advocated the party adopt the approach of third way social democracy in Europe. Upon assuming leadership of the of the New Brunswick NDP in 2011, he shifted policies toward the center, alienating traditional supporters, many of whom then defected to the provinces’ Green Party. Although Cardy never secured a seat for the NDP in the provincial legislature, the Green Party managed to do so while the New Brunswick NDP was under his leadership, providing a much-needed progressive option for the province. In early 2017, he left the party blaming his departure on conflicts with the province’s largest public sector union, party insiders, and his disagreement with the federal NDP’s opposition to militarily intervening in the Syrian civil war. He saw these factors as “destructive forces.” To be fair, Cardy was never a good fit for even the tepidly social democratic NDP. The embryonic CFP seems like a much better fit. To give an idea of what kind of so-called social democrat Cardy was, he denounced the NDP upon his departure by stating: “Those same destructive forces continue their sterile battle, ignoring the will of the party they claim to champion, using language from the 1930s and policies from the 1970s. There is nothing progressive about this behaviour.” Cardy promptly thereafter jumped to the New Brunswick Progressive Conservatives (PC). While initially suggesting he would work behind the scenes, he eventually ran for and won a seat in the 2018 provincial election. He was appointed minister of education and early childhood development, but resigned from the position in October 2022, citing Premier Blaine Higgs’s leadership style and conduct as unacceptable. Now he has remerged in his quixotic quest to create a new centrist party in Canada. A Dead Ideology Ideologically, the kind of party that CFP strives to be is firmly rooted in Canadian history. In many ways, it mirrors the ideology of the (Progressive) Conservative Party from Canada’s confederation in 1867 to the 1990s. During that era, the Conservatives typically aligned with Red Toryism, also known as One Nation Conservatism in Britain. That form of conservatism emphasized communitarianism, paternalism, noblesse oblige, and nationalism. In its Canadian variant, it promoted national industrial development through tariffs and infrastructure building, as well as favoring the British Empire over closer relations with the United States. Additionally, it enjoyed large Protestant support. Conversely, the Liberals advocated for free trade with the United States, Quebec interests, and garnered support from Catholics across the country. After World War II, these traditions began to wane and a realignment in Canadian conservatism occurred. By the 1980s, the PCs were leading proponents of free trade with the United States, and conservatism in Canada has since become closely associated with neoliberalism and neoconservatism. Despite some attempts by Red Tories in the 1990s and early 2000s to avoid being overshadowed on the Right by the ideological heirs of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, the shift toward a more market-oriented conservatism has persisted. The foundations of Red Toryism have been eroded by the decline of the British Empire and the rise of neoliberalism. The CFP also faces certain challenges within the Canadian political system. One of the most significant is the first-past-the-post electoral system, which tends to not be friendly to new parties. The Reform Party, a predecessor to today’s Conservative Party, is a notable exception to this rule. However, even the Reform Party failed to make inroads in Eastern Canada and achieve the status of a viable party of government until it merged with the PCs in 2003. Another factor to consider is the adaptability of the Liberal Party. It is the one of the most successful political parties in any democratic country, having held power for nearly seventy years during the twentieth century. The Liberal Party has demonstrated its ability to secure the support of successive waves of immigrants and has successfully adapted to both Keynesianism and neoliberalism. This is where the CFP will likely falter. The party’s vision doesn’t offer much that the Liberals, Conservatives or even the NDP cannot provide. The CFP wants to reduce the deficit and government debt. The Liberals may have put deficit reduction on hold for now, but that certainly doesn’t mean they will going forward. With Justin Trudeau’s popularity declining, there are prospective future Liberal leaders, like Treasury Board president Anita Anand, who are already carrying out attempts to cut departmental budgets. History shows us that the Liberals can be deficit hawks too, like in the 1990s. And, of course, the Conservatives want to cut the debt. On such a playing field, there does not appear to be much room for the CFP to distinguish themselves. Or, indeed, make clear what purpose they would serve."

The Republican front-runner has retained this overwhelming advantage in the face of a civil court finding him liable for sexual abuse, various grand juries indicting him for state and federal crimes, and his own decision to skip a nationally televised primary debate. At this point, Trump is less likely to lose renomination to Ron DeSantis than to a heart attack. This is a dispiriting state of affairs for conservatives who disdain uncouth insurrectionists but despise liberalism all the more. These anti-anti-Trumpers spent much of the 2016 primary cataloguing the GOP front-runner’s myriad demerits as both a conservative and human being. Then it became clear that a critical mass of Republican voters did not care (or else believe) that Trump was an abusive con man, vicious misogynist, or worse, a supporter of the auto bailouts.

We 're doing things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we 're leaving a splash , we 've made a series of mistakes . '' • CIA does n't assess that Iran is making nuclear weapons : Weissgold says , `` We do not assess right now that Iran is in the process of making a nuclear weapon . But what we do assess is that Iran is doing more and more to be ready to make a nuclear weapon .

We 're following individuals and groups and trends beyond our borders that affect our national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really important to highlight , as an analyst at CIA , you inform , you do not make policy . So that was part of why President Truman set up the CIA in 1947 . We try to go beyond what 's happening to examine why it 's happening and then to talk about the implications of that . We try to give our leaders a decision advantage by pointing out leverage that they may have . And when it 's done right , I guess what I would say is we give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , new ways to think about dangers and opportunities around the world . Whether that topic is an enduring one , an emerging one or one that 's way over the horizon . DAVE MARLOWE : Thanks also for the opportunity to be here . Thanks , Michael , for hosting us . The fundamental job of an operations officer , as I see it , is that we go overseas in somebody else 's country and we understand them in their circumstances and in their world as they see themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to say that the difference between policy and intelligence is that policy is about how you want the world to be . Intelligence is about how it is . And our job is to go to other people 's countries , see them in their environment , see how they understand their problems , see how they see us , and understand what it is that 's in their minds and bring some piece of that back that 's useful for Linda 's folks to digest . MICHAEL MORELL : One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career discussion . Movies , TV , series , paint CIA in certain ways what is it really like on a day to day basis to work at CIA ? Dave , want to go first on this one ? DAVE MARLOWE : There 's fewer cocktails and tuxedos for sure . I ca n't think of a spy movie I 've seen that I thought was an honest depiction . We 're methodical , meticulous . We take our responsibility seriously . We 're deliberate and disciplined . There 's no flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're playing a long , careful game . We 're not running something that can be accomplished in 90 minutes of a movie . We 're doing things that are over the long term . And if we 're leaving a splash , we 've made a series of mistakes . Our job is to do what we 're doing in the director of operations and not leave a trace that we 've been there . LINDA WEISSGOLD : I 'm not a big fan of spy movies because I find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I find that they 're very distorted . I once , when I was a briefer , after I 'd been briefed , I once was overseas and a liaison partner of ours very seriously asked me if my job as the president 's briefer had been like- there was a series that had been done called The Briefer with Katherine Heigl , in which she would brief the president in the morning , jump on a plane , jump out of the plane , go kill someone . And he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ? And I told him , absolutely . But when you really do ask , what is our job like ? For me working at CIA , it is a form of public service . And I think that 's a really important thing for people to remember . The place is filled with some of the most intelligent , most interesting , most determined people you are ever going to meet . And not once in my career . And as was mentioned , it 's been a long one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what my politics are . And I do n't ask other people because that 's not what we 're there for . We are all there united , I think , in one mission , which is the protection of the United States . And that makes it really special . People cry when they leave the CIA . And so I think that 's something really important to think about . But if you get back to the movies , someday I still do want a computer where I can manipulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice that no one ever has to fill out like a travel voucher . There is a bureaucratic side to it . We are a government agency . I do think there 's a little bit of that . it 's a special place , but it 's one that takes you wanting to be there and everyone else around you wants to be there as well . MICHAEL MORELL : So your careers . How did you each find your way to CIA ? Linda wants to go first . LINDA WEISSGOLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something international . I graduated from Georgetown School Foreign Service . I had lived overseas , but the CIA was n't actually on my radar . So I often joke that my coming to CIA was really about serendipity and a lack of a social life because I had a roommate at the time who worked for a congresswoman on the Hill , and this was the mid-eighties . And my roommate was very much into women in leadership . She worked for Congresswoman Pat Schroeder , and she had bought tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about women in leadership . And something came up and she could n't make it . And so she asked me , did I want to go , and I was free . I did n't have much of a social life . So I said , sure . So I go to this session and it was a two day session . And over the night there was a hijacking in Athens . And all kinds of people were talking about giving up their tickets . They were on the news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets to go to Athens . And I remember I came in and I said , are you kidding me ? And she said , really ? And I said , It 's not going to happen in the same place twice , right ? Sure I would get on the next plane . This was the mid eighties , she was already teaching women in leadership courses for the agency . And she said , I have some people you should talk to . And she directed me there . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called thinking that I was going to be having an informational interview more with the idea that back then we did n't have the luxury of the website , which we 're going to mention several times tonight , as you know , CIA.gov . So I thought I was calling up to get an informational interview and the guy said , Oh , Jinx said you should call . He said , We 're having a test next weekend . I , again , was n't busy , so I showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled out any paperwork . This would never happen today and apparently did really well on the test because they then started calling me , asking me to please fill out the paperwork . And here we have job offers for you . So it was total serendipity . I will just add when I tell the story in our organization , one of the things I say is that be open to opportunities when they come . If you end up at CIA or whatever your careers might be , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when someone 's going to come to you and say , hey , would you do this ? And it may not have been . For those of you who are planners , it may not have been on your five year plan . It may not have been what you were thinking . And what I say is that you are going to learn the most from those jobs that you probably were n't thinking about . And you will get all kinds of experiences and it may set you on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to opportunities when they come . DAVE MARLOWE : So I graduated from William and Mary in 1984 , and my objective in college had been basically to get out alive . And so the summer after I graduated , I started thinking about what I wanted to do with my life . I talked to the parents of some friends who worked in various national security roles . I traveled through Europe and I came back with kind of a job description of what I wanted to do . I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the embassy , maybe something in national security , something that was results oriented and something that was n't in the spotlight , which kind of brought me into the director of operations . So I talked to some adults that I respected and laid out a path for myself , which was to go into the army , to go to the military . And I chose the army and got some kind of background experience that would make me more marketable than where I was at the time . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my particular path . They taught me Arabic for about a year and a half in California . And then I went to school and I spent the next couple of years in the Army and ended up coming here in 1991 , right after the Gulf War . MICHAEL MORELL : So outside your current jobs , what 's the best assignment you ever had at CIA , Dave ? DAVE MARLOWE : I 'm not going to say where , but I had a number of assignments in the Middle East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody spoke English at all . And if you can go live in a country that is sort of unadulterated by the Western experience , it 's something absolutely different from going to Europe , which is like America , but they do n't speak English . And it was just fantastic . I lived on local food . I lived in Arabic every day . I knew the names of all the different kinds of fish in the fish market and the fruits and vegetables and all that kind of stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , part adventurer , part anthropologist , part sociologist . And just having an absolute blast . LINDA WEISSGOLD : I said , I 've had a ton of amazing opportunities . I 've actually followed you in several jobs . First I want to say why I 've been at CIA so long , because it does get to what my favorite job has been . The CIA is about your capability , not your rank . And so one of my very first jobs was my account in the Middle East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had only been on the account for a very short period of time , a couple of months when the Sunni prime minister was assassinated . And my part of the account was I was following , among other things , the Sunnis who were considered the less important account . What amazed me at the time was that I was not asked to hand over my research to a more senior officer . It was me . I was front and center and I was hooked . I was hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about your capability . So I guess I would say you ca n't be more front and center at CIA than being the president 's briefer . And I would say that was probably my favorite job , because it really was a tremendous honor to be the one to go in every morning to represent the work of the agency , whether that be the analytic work , the operational work , to be the one to kind of see history happening , how intelligence was really being used every day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to make the timing window right . All of those kinds of things . It made me a better analyst . And so I guess what I really saw was how intelligence informs policy debate , and that would probably be my favorite job . MICHAEL MORELL : Probably the two most important career related questions that we 're going to talk about tonight . Number one , what advice would you give to any student here who might be interested in a career as an analyst or an operations officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are going to see the difference , one of the differences between the DO and the DA . I brought notes because I wanted to make sure that I gave you guys really good advice and did n't forget anything . So first off- DAVE MARLOWE : I 'm just going to copy hers . LINDA WEISSGOLD : So he stole the information and gave it to me . It was fine . So I 'm really thrilled you 're asking about a career as an analyst , but I really would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the other directorates as well . And to really highlight the idea that at CIA , we are looking for people who do all kinds of things . We hire for almost every imaginable skill , graphic artists , accountants , engineers , logisticians , data scientists . So it 's about more than just our directorates . And again , if you do n't hear something from us , go to the website because there 's all kinds of opportunities . So first , if you 're currently a student and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I highly encourage you to participate in our student programs . It is the perfect opportunity for you to get a chance to look at us and for us to get a chance to look at you . Like I said , it was a black box when I joined . It was kind of a leap of faith . But this is something that gives you that opportunity to really understand what it would be like . In the director of analysis , if you are a student intern or a graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact work of an analyst . You 're writing for the president . You 're just getting more help in doing it . So we 're not going to ask you to make coffee or go make copies or anything like that . You are an analyst , so if you want to do that , you should try and get your resumes in by the end of this year for next summer . It does take some time . I also want to point out that we 're in the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in how you apply . And so rather than being an application , it will be a resume based system . So I want to tell you it 's okay to have a beefy resume . Like two pages are good . And I know that may be counterintuitive for some jobs , but it really is a way for us to get to know you a little bit more . And particularly as a student , when you may not have as many job experiences . We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have . So it 'll help us understand the depth and the breadth and your skills . Just a couple more things . Do n't be afraid to show passion and enthusiasm for this choice . The people who will be interviewing you at CIA , they 're not professional recruiters . They are officers . And so for us , they are analysts who are on rotation trying to make sure that we are bringing in for the next generation the best and the brightest . So if you talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you want to come , it 's not going to sound corny to them . It 's the same reasons that they came . So like I said , do n't be afraid to show that passion and enthusiasm . And then last thing I 'll just say is stop doing marijuana at least 90 days before you come . We do still follow the federal law guidelines . So while it may be legal in Maryland and other places , we follow federal law . DAVE MARLOWE : The one piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the director of operations , and I 'm sure this is true for for all the directors is if coming to the CIA is your plan B or your sort of fallback thing that you 're going to do if something else does n't work out , that is the wrong approach . For every 100 applicants that we receive , it 's a very small percentage that actually make it through to be hired , probably less than 5 % . And the people who get through get through because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply now or this summer and you do n't get through the process , you 're sent a very nice no thank you letter . That does n't mean you should quit it . What it means is you should think about , is this what I really want to do ? And if it is what you really want to do , then go out and build your resume and add some life experience . So what life experience do you put on your resume ? Well , I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the kinds of people that you would predict somebody who 's had military experience or business experience , or we would hire people who are out of law school . All those things are true . But we 've also had I 'm not sure if he 's still with us , a world famous rock and roll guitarist , professional athletes , ballet dancers , college professors , people that you would not imagine would end up working in the Directorate of Operations . And what they 've all brought is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their resume , but a determination , a determination to win and resilience . And that 's what we 're looking for in the director of operations . If you 're an officer , you have to be comfortable when you 've kind of fallen back to Plan G because you 're already forming the elements of Plan L and Plan M because you 're going to have to adapt . And so really that 's the most important thing for us is determination and resilience . And then , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , integrity . We 're entrusted with a great deal of responsibility that 's unique to us . And whether it 's me having tens of thousands of dollars in cash to hand to somebody in an alley for a very sort of minimal receipt or Linda sitting in front of the president and saying , this is the thing I know and this is a thing I do n't know . Integrity is absolutely paramount . MICHAEL MORELL : So I 'll speak from experience . It 's great to have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intramural basketball team . Very , very helpful to winning . Dave , you answered the second question already , which is what do you look for in terms of a skill set ? What about an analyst ? What do you look for ? LINDA WEISSGOLD : A lot of them are things you 'd expect : strong writing , strong briefing , intellectual curiosity , thoughtfulness and definitely integrity . What we do is high stakes , as Dave said , and it involves really sensitive information and telling policymakers things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that takes some courage . That integrity , it 's something we ca n't teach . And so it 's something you need to show us when you before you get hired . Expertise is absolutely important . It 's the coin of the realm for the director of analysis . Either show that you have some in a discipline , like you 're a kick ass economist or you are a military analyst or that you have some substantive expertise . Whether you are a quantum physicist or you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're looking for something that you can use to develop the insight that we provide . Language skills , of course , are a plus for the entire agency , as are overseas experiences . I would say diversity of thought is really important , diversity as a whole . We ca n't afford to have groupthink . So I look for people who actually may have some outside of the box thinking or come from left field ideas . And then the last one , I 'll just say is humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do is hard . We are not going to get it right all the time . We have to admit when we 're wrong , we have to think about when it 's time to actually reevaluate and adjust our analysis . And you 're not always the smartest person in the room , right ? So you have to be open to the ideas . What we do is a lot of teamwork . So I often like to say that thinking may be a solitary skill , but analysis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team players and have the humility to be open to ideas from others . DAVE MARLOWE : Great . Can I just follow up and pick up on something that Linda said . I remember very well being in my late teens and early twenties and trying to figure out who I was . And I think it 's important that when you 're looking at a potential career at CIA , you know what motivates you and you 're not going to get paid as well as you can if you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to be demands placed on you that normal people do n't have to deal with . Some of it has to do with your freedom of movement . You have to tell people when you 're going places , you ca n't bring your phone into the office . There 's a lot that you surrender , including the potential for a fat paycheck when you come to work for CIA . And the folks who do it and do it well are genuinely motivated by patriotism and not the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4th of July , the patriotism that drives you when things are difficult or mundane or scary or professionally challenging . And if that 's what drives you , then you probably have a place here . If you 're thinking , well , I can do this for a little bit and then make some money . This is not the place . MICHAEL MORELL : Let 's turn to global hotspots in the world today , which we could talk about for hours . I want to do this a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . What I 'd like to do is just throw out an issue and just get each of you to respond fairly quickly , fairly briefly , on what you think is the most important thing that all of us should keep in mind with regard to that issue . Dave , I 'm going to go to the operator . Russia 's invasion of Ukraine . DAVE MARLOWE : I 'll tell you what this looks like to the Directorate of Operations . I 'm not an analyst , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putin was at his best moment the day before he invaded because he had all the course of power that he 's ever going to have . And his objectives were to squeeze things out of Ukraine , to threaten NATO and affect NATO unification and to show off to the world that Russia is powerful militarily , economically , diplomatically . He squandered every single bit of that . And so for the director of operations , we 're looking around the world for Russians who were are disgusted with that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . LINDA WEISSGOLD : I would say that it 's important to note Putin has not given up on the expansive goals that he had for Ukraine . And actually , let me backup and just say I totally understand why you made the link , because actually everything we 're going to talk about , I think on hot spots , it 's all interconnected because the world is actually watching what we are doing and how we are reacting in Ukraine . China is watching that . And so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Putin has n't given up . This is n't going to end anytime soon . I think this could certainly drag on . It 's important . I think a lesson we all need to take . It 's really important to know what you 're fighting for . The Ukrainian soldiers know that , the Russian soldiers not so much . That interconnectedness , allowing a country to take territory just because they can , is likely to embolden others to do the same at a really high human cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about China-Taiwan , I guess the things to think about , as I was saying , Xi is certainly watching what 's going on . And he has not been shy about the idea that he wants to have control of Taiwan , even if that requires military movements to do so . I think one of the things it 's really important for us to think about , as China has graduated , if you will , from being a rising power to really being the largest , most important geopolitical issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think really what we 're seeing is China in so many domains , more than the Cold War and Russia , is now a competitor . So whether we 're talking about militarily , economically , through technology , space , in just about every domain you can think of , China is a competitor with us now . And I think that that is something for us to think about when we think about China . DAVE MARLOWE : I would just add that five , ten years ago everybody was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now it 's plain and it 's in the open . It 's the challenge of the next generation of intelligence officers . LINDA WEISSGOLD : Can I just add one other thing , which is that we talked about languages . It sure would n't hurt if you want to go learn Mandarin . The agency , and we 're not alone in this in the government , we are putting a lot more resources to working on China . And so we 've created a new China mission center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China is now trying to be a global power . And so we 're looking at China and Africa , China and Latin America . Regardless of maybe your area of expertise , if you 're thinking regionally , if it is Latin America or Africa , it does n't hurt for you to also learn about China , because that 's something for us that we are all thinking about them globally . MICHAEL MORELL : Iran 's behavior , whether it 's toward its own people , whether it 's toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about nuclear weapons . LINDA WEISSGOLD : I think the thing I would say about Iran at this point , a couple of things . One , we do not believe we do not assess right now that Iran is in the process of making a nuclear weapon . But what we do assess is that Iran is doing more and more to be ready to make a nuclear weapon . So whether it be improving their enrichment capabilities , you know , they are exceeding all of the limits that were part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that that 's an important thing for us to think about with Iran . I think it 's important when we talk about Iran , to remember that Iran is a threat not just to U.S. interests , but to the interest of our allies in the region . And that is also something that we care about . We do n't just talk about U.S. national security interests . We talk about the interests of our allies as well . And then in the context of the current protests that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important when you think about Iran to think through the fact that we talk about moderates and reformers and conservatives , but it 's all in the context of a conservative theocracy . So when you talk about a moderate in Iran , it 's not necessarily someone who is looking to have a democratic freedom of speech , all of those kinds of things . I remember President Bush used to ask me and when we would talk about Iran , he would say , it 's not a free and fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of a town square and say whatever they want to say as part of that ? And he said , until they can do that , it 's not a free and fair election . And it still is n't today . MICHAEL MORELL : Dave , you had a lot of time in the Middle East . Your thoughts on this ? DAVE MARLOWE : Iran is fascinating . Back to what I said earlier about going to other people 's countries and understanding them as they understand themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apocalyptic vision . Is there a modern government . You 've got echoes of their Persian past and then you 've got the conflict between Shia and Sunni that sort of defines their relationship with their neighbors , whether their Sunni neighbors or mixed neighbors like they are in Iraq . It 's absolutely a fascinating human intelligence challenge to understand what 's happening there . And where are the levers and where are the opportunities for the US government ? MICHAEL MORELL : North Korea in its flurry of missile tests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think their petulant child having a tantrum . I 'm sorry . 'Look at me . We 're still here . ' t 's the most closed society on the planet . And even more so with the COVID lockdown , the image of the Russian diplomats working their way out on that old fashioned train railcar . It 's an extremely hard intelligence problem , not insurmountable . LINDA WEISSGOLD : I would just add , I totally agree . North Korea does n't like to be ignored and they will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying attention . But back to that kind of interconnectedness , I think it 's really important to think about the idea that for North Korea , what China thinks and does is actually more important than what we do in some ways . They are very dependent upon China for a lot . And so sometimes when you work on an issue , it 's not just about knowing that issue . You need to know what 's going on in the region . You need to know what others and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea . MICHAEL MORELL : International terrorism in the aftermath of Afghanistan . LINDA WEISSGOLD : So I 'll keep it short on that and just say the threat is not gone . And we have made tremendous strides in diminishing that threat . But it 's not over . And we ca n't afford to take our eye off the ball , and we 're not going to . DAVE MARLOWE : And as Zawahiri would tell you , you ca n't hide . LINDA WEISSGOLD : We can find you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and talk about the future of the organization . And it struck me when earlier on the first question I asked you , what 's the job of an analyst ? What 's the job of an operations officer ? Your answer was true 75 years ago . And it 's true today . So I want to start by actually asking you , what are the keys to successful analysis ? What are the keys to successful operations ? And how do you make sure in the future that those factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How we do our jobs as CIA analysts I think is what sets us apart from whether it be the media or think tanks . They 're important . I do n't see them as competitors . It 's just we do our jobs very differently . And I think what makes successful analysis , we rely on three privileged accesses . The first is access to the time , the thinking and the goals of our country 's leaders . That is what allows us to understand what they need and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to a vast range of information . We are all source analysts , so that includes unclassified and classified information . And that information really gives us this huge sandbox to develop insights , hopefully unique insights . And then it 's the access to CIA 's reputation . CIA 's reputation gets us a seat at the table . It gets us a chance to be heard . But all of those are grants of trust . They are not grants of power . They are things that we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . And we have to be living up to that . LINDA WEISSGOLD : So the reputation I 'm talking about really comes from , I think , our tradecraft . And that 's that when we are going to , as I said earlier , we 're going to call it like we see it . We 're going to be objective . We 're going to be honest about telling people what we know , what we do n't know . But often when I talk about tradecraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , it 's about being able to tell our customers why we think what we think . And that 's really hard . If you guys try to unpack that as students and you 're thinking about this from a paper you 're writing , to actually go back in and be able to explain to a professor why you think that . And then I 'll add an extra twist to this . Several years later , when you 're sitting in front of Congress and you 're being grilled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some inevitable investigation . To be able to do that , too . And that 's the kind of reputation I 'm talking about . I think , you know , we have to be able to do that . DAVE MARLOWE : I think for operations officers , it 's the same kinds of traits . But in a different scenario . We really need to be humble and be dispassionate and objective . And if you think about what we do , so we say that we spy . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people who spy , and we give them some kind of compensation in exchange for that . And so if we 're going to invite somebody into a relationship where they 're risking prison or death , when they 're betraying their tribe or their institution or their country because they believe in what they 're doing with us , we have to be very judicious about that . And we have to know what we 're doing and why we 're doing it . We have to be sure that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , that we 're after something that can only be obtained through our unique function . So ultimately , it comes down to being honest with yourself and being honest about the situation you 're in . Am I doing this the right way ? Should I be doing this ? What part of this relationship is about me and what part of it is about the agent ? It really requires a cold blooded , dispassionate objectivity . And it 's really not any different than when Linda 's folks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to the president ? MICHAEL MORELL : When we go into a relationship with one of those individuals , their security is paramount . DAVE MARLOWE : It 's our top priority . Absolutely . And if we fail on that , we 're failing fundamentally . MICHAEL MORELL : Last question . The challenge is going forward . For each of your professions , each of your directorates , how do you think about what the big challenges are that you have to deal with successfully in order for the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARLOWE : I would say two things . The first is that the world is a much more intrusive space . It used to be when I was a young officer , I could fly to a country , take a train across the border to another country , check into some hostel , scribble my name on the register or pay in cash , meet my guy and leave . And I was never there . And now , if you travel any place , you do n't have a reservation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't have your smartphone with you . You have n't been scanned in every imaginable way along your trip . That 's anomalous . So we have to actually raise our prioritization . So that we 're really expanding that risk on things that truly , truly matter . The other thing that I am concerned about and that we talk about regularly is all the relationships that we 've built up over the past 20 years that allowed us to be effective in the counterterrorism effort . We absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a unified way against our principal adversary now . And that 's China . LINDA WEISSGOLD : I would say we are swimming in data and information and technology is a great thing . It should help us . It also is going to increase the difficulty of us figuring out misinformation . And so part of our job is really going to be this idea of leveraging technology to our advantage and at the same time making sure that we are kind of sorting through what should we be believing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through things . MICHAEL MORELL : So the changes the director made , I do n't know , 18 months ago now , the media focused on the creation of the China Mission Center . But it kind of missed the creation of a chief technology officer , the creation of a new directorate focused on technology . So huge , huge emphasis seems to be on technology at the agency to help you do your job , to protect you and doing your job right . Could you just talk about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Absolutely . Dave and I actually spent some time together in a meeting today on this very topic . And the idea being looking at things on , as you said , how can we- when I think about technology from the analyst 's point of view it is a topic that we study , right ?

"Britain’s ruling Conservative (Tory) party is holding its annual conference. Commentators have characterized this simply as a forum for future leadership candidates to set out their positions and campaign for support. It is widely expected that the Tories will be severely defeated in the next parliamentary elections due before January 2025 and that current leader and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will then stand down provoking a leadership election. [IVP] A a sizable portion of the Conservative Party’s ever more right wing base will support Home Secretary Suella Braverman’s bid for the party’s leadership after the next election. In 1968, right-wing Tory MP Enoch Powell made his famous “rivers of blood” speech, predicting a race war if non-white immigrants came to Britain in large numbers. Home Secretary Suella Braverman’s speech at a right-wing US think tank predicted “truly colossal” numbers trying to break into Britain. Powell’s 1968 speech led to his ostracism from the political mainstream, including in the parliamentary Conservative Party. By the time Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979, Powell’s racist views had won the day in the Conservative Party. Now Suella Braverman wants to go much further and put in question Britain’s position in the 1951 convention on refugees."

For example , he has spoken about his belief that abortion is never necessary to save a mother ’ s life . He is most widely known among Catholics , for whom he is a polarizing figure at a time when the U.S. church seems divided between pro- and anti-Trump believers , between people who can ’ t believe a Catholic president who supports abortion rights can be given Communion and those who think an alliance with Trump is heretical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Creighton University School of Medicine who writes often about abortion , noted that Pavone has been controversial for many years , and that he became more so in 2016 , when two days before the presidential election he posted a live video on Facebook of an aborted fetus laid out on a table that he was using like an altar .

The letter sent by Archbishop Christophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States , to bishops included a statement they could use to discuss the laicization with their members , but the statement wasn ’ t signed . He has been associated with several dioceses over the years and it isn ’ t clear who his superior is at this time .

Cancel culture is alive and well in the Catholic Church. ” Zurek suspended him from activities outside that diocese in 2011 , citing “ deep concerns ” about the stewardship and alleged lack of transparency around the money being raised by Priests for Life .

"The morning of March 25, 2022, had started out like any other workday for Terrisa Bukovinac, as she and fellow anti-abortion rights activist Lauren Handy headed over to protest the Washington Surgi-Clinic in Washington, D.C. — until they asked the driver of a medical waste truck for a box that would change their lives. Inside that box, the activists say, were more than 100 small embryos and five large fetuses, which they handled with gloved hands in Handy’s apartment, crying and gasping in a video they uploaded to their website. In the year since, the group Bukovinac founded, Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, has — without success — called for autopsies of the fetuses and for Washington Surgi-Clinic to be investigated for infanticide. The group has also been using these images to foment outrage against abortion."

"When Donald Trump announced his presidential candidacy in 2015, many predicted he would herald a new era of Republican politics centered on populist messaging and protectionist economic policy. But across the last seven years, the emergence of Trump has revealed the dangers of how the Republican Party holds primary elections. It has become commonplace to hear people fed up with the polarization of the system, the constant personal attacks, and the lack of substantive debate and action by both political parties. The simple fact is that the Republican National Committee has been hollowed out and reduced to a fundraising mechanism for whoever controls the party at any given moment. Trump and his wing of the party would argue that the RNC and Republicans in name only, or RINOS, have a stranglehold on politics and are stifling the voice of the American people. But Trump’s wing of the party exacerbates this problem when it only follows the constantly swaying praise of a former one-term president."

And we also have members of the House, led by my good friend, Chip Roy, who are concerned about policy issues. They want riders in the appropriations bills, amendments in the appropriations bills that guarantee some type of security on our Southern border. “So you take those things put together, and Kevin McCarthy, the speaker, has made promises on each of those issues to different groups. And now it is all coming due at the same time,” Buck said."

""""""" This is an allegation for now , with no reporting to confirm it . But if it happens , it ’ ll be a case of Russia following its own playbook . In 2014 , the last time Moscow tried to carve off pieces of Ukraine , it held three separate referenda to give its war of conquest a patina of democratic legitimacy . After its military occupied Crimea , a referendum was held there in which residents ( supposedly ) voted to formally leave Ukraine and rejoin the Russian Federation . Referenda were also held in Donetsk and Luhansk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with each ( supposedly ) voting to become an independent republic . The Nazi Anschluss of Austria was also put to a referendum . It ’ s an old imperialist trick designed to let the invader claim that he ’ s acting in accordance with the will of the people . It ’ s not really “ aggression ” if your new subjects willingly submit to your authority , is it ? Ukraine ’ s human rights commissioner says she has reason to believe Russia ’ s set to do it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one major Ukrainian population center that ’ s been occupied since the first weeks of the war . The timing is interesting for several reasons . Human rights commissioner Lyudmila Denisova said Russian forces were distributing propaganda material telling people in occupied Kherson that Moscow was acting for their benefit . She said leaflets handed out “ blame the Ukrainians themselves and their chosen government ” for the aggression against their country , echoing the Kremlin ’ s messaging about the invasion… Ms Denisova said there was evidence that Russia was planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in early May , citing witnesses who said ballot papers were already being prepared at a local printing house… Ukraine ’ s Defence Ministry meanwhile said Russia was planning to falsify results by collecting personal data on residents under cover of distributing humanitarian aid . None of these referenda are legal under the Ukrainian constitution , which reportedly and sensibly requires a national vote in order to approve of any territorial changes . And no one except Russia takes them seriously since the balloting will surely be tampered with and/or the population , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes the wrong way , will feel coerced into voting for “ independence. ” But Putin is looking for victories in Ukraine and having Kherson pretend-secede from Ukraine would qualify as one , at least on Russian state media . Which brings us to the timing : Why does “ May 1 to 10 ” sound familiar ? Ah , right : It ’ s because Russia holds its annual “ Victory Day ” celebration to commemorate the Nazis ’ defeat each year on May 9 . Observers have speculated that Putin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ukraine to tout at this year ’ s parade but the calendar , and the Ukrainian army , aren ’ t cooperating with him . No one expects Russia to conquer the Donbas in the next three weeks , which is how much time they have before Victory Day , so they need a Plan B . A rigged referendum held around that time establishing the “ People ’ s Republican of Kherson ” might be it . Ukrainian media claims that Russia is planning some fireworks for its little democracy pageant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation in Kherson that ’ s blamed on Ukrainian forces would let Russia say , “ See ? The people are voting for independence because they ’ re enraged at the Ukrainian forces who are brutalizing them. ” No one outside Russia takes any of this seriously . Inside Russia I ’ m sure it ’ s a different story . The clock is running on Putin in another way besides the May 9 target , though . He may want to have a referendum in Kherson on the books soon because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to hold the city . Note that the UK ’ s map of the conflict finds the two sides contesting the area around it : Ukrainian media claims their forces recently pushed deeper into Kherson province , towards the city of Kherson .

"Trump’s poll numbers have steadily risen. Is the Republican presidential primary over? R: The Republican presidential primary is most likely over. I do not want Trump to win the nomination, but I do not think there is a chance of him losing the primary. Perhaps things will change once the primary voting starts, but that may be a long shot. To defeat a former or incumbent president in a primary takes a lot of skill, and I regretfully do not think any of the current candidates possess that skill. I would like to see a new nominee, like Ron DeSantis or Tim Scott, take the reins of the Republican Party, but that is not probable in this current atmosphere. Alas, the words of that old Glenn Miller song are not true; wishing will not make it so. L: The Republican presidential primary never got off the ground– Donald Trump was always going to be the nominee. So far, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has mounted the strongest challenge to the former president. A myriad of factors– numerous unconscionable domestic policies like book bans and the “Don’t Say Gay” law, high campaign turnover, poor campaign strategy, and the governor’s inexperience in the realm of retail politics– have caused the campaign to freefall in the polls. As DeSantis declines, former UN ambassador and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is rising in the polls. Time will tell if this surge is sustainable, but Trump’s majority in the polls appears to be increasing and insurmountable. With three months to the first contest, the Republican primary is shaping up to be a competitive race for second place."

The 74-year-old Garvey, a former Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres first baseman, brings star power that could distinguish his candidacy in a crowded field.

"Photo: Kevin Lamarque/REUTERS It seems clear enough that Joe Biden is up to the job of being president. The economy is booming, especially for the poor and working class; he has signed more bipartisan legislation (on infrastructure, guns, and domestic manufacturing) than anybody expected; and he has held together the western alliance while maintaining a dogged defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty after Russia expected to swallow up its smaller neighbor. But whether Biden is up to the task of running for president is another matter. The national polls show a virtual tie with Biden leading Donald Trump, on average, by less than a point. Since the Electoral College has given Trump a substantial edge in each of the past two elections, it seems as though Biden needs much more than that. He won by 4.4 percentage points in 2020, and had he performed just over half a point worse, Trump probably wouldn’t have even needed to try to steal a second term."

""""""" LGBTQ activists and supporters hold a rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court as it hears arguments in a major LGBT rights case on whether a federal anti-discrimination law that prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of sex covers gay and transgender employees in Washington , October 8 , 2019 . The House on Tuesday passed legislation to codify same-sex marriage nationwide and strengthen other marriage-equality protections , in a direct reaction to the Supreme Court 's recent ruling that overturned longstanding federal abortion rights . The bill , which passed 267-157 , was expected to make it through the Democrat-majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future in the Senate , where passage will require at least 10 Republican votes . 47 Republicans voted for the bill alongside all Democrats . Rep. Ritchie Torres , D-N.Y. , the first openly gay Afro-Latino member of Congress , presided over the vote . The Respect for Marriage Act would establish that a marriage is considered valid under federal law if it was legal in the state where it was performed . The bill would explicitly bar anyone from denying `` full faith and credit '' to an out-of-state marriage based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin , regardless of any individual state 's law . It would grant the U.S. attorney general the authority to enforce that rule through civil action . It would also fully repeal the Defense of Marriage Act , known as DOMA , the 1996 law signed by then-President Bill Clinton that defined marriage as being the union of a man and a woman . The Supreme Court gutted DOMA through its 2013 ruling in United States v. Windsor . Two years later , the court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DOMA technically remains a law , and the House now aims to scrub it from the books entirely . But to make it to President Joe Biden 's desk , the bill will need to survive the Senate , where the parties are split 50-50 and 60 votes are required for most legislation to pass . Many conservatives in the chamber will likely argue states should decide their own same-sex marriage laws . Lawmakers are also expected this week to vote on a bill enshrining the right to contraception — another push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's major decision last month in Dobbs v. Jackson Women 's Health Organization . The ruling struck down the legal precedents that had protected abortion rights for nearly 50 years . The conservative majority , which includes three justices appointed by former President Donald Trump , argued in part in its ruling that `` the Constitution makes no reference to abortion , and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision . '' That legal reasoning sparked widespread fears that the court could threaten other rights previously considered settled . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those concerns . The justice argued that the ruling in Dobbs should lead the court to reconsider the landmark cases establishing the rights to obtain contraception , engage in private sex acts and marry someone of the same sex . `` As this Court may take aim at other fundamental rights , we can not sit idly by as the hard-earned gains of the Equality movement are systematically eroded , '' House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler , D-N.Y. , said in a statement Monday detailing the Respect for Marriage Act , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's concurrence teaches anything it 's that we can not let your guard down or the rights and freedoms that we have come to cherish will vanish into a cloud of radical ideology and dubious legal reasoning , '' Nadler 's statement said . Other justices did not echo Thomas ' opinion . But it raised concerns that the court , which now has a 6-to-3 conservative majority , would be willing to take up cases challenging those rights in the future . Justice Samuel Alito , who wrote for the majority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion . '' But critics , including the court 's three liberal justices , were unconvinced . `` We can not understand how anyone can be confident that today 's opinion will be the last of its kind , '' the liberals wrote in a fierce dissent in Dobbs .

The meeting reportedly lasted four hours . `` If Russia once again uses force against Ukraine and further invades Ukraine , then we have to seriously look into the need to further increase our presence in the eastern part of the alliance , '' Stoltenberg told reporters after Wednesday 's meeting . While Stoltenberg reiterated what 's at stake amid the 'Ukraine 2.0 ' crisis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new armed conflict in Europe '' - Russia has continued to assure the West it is not planning any kind of Ukraine invasion . At the same time , Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman - who led Monday talks for the US in Geneva - condemned Russia 's `` unprovoked military buildup '' near Ukraine . She also said that NATO poses no threat to Russia , and that Moscow should not see the Western military alliance as such . Below are key points made in the NATO Secretary-General 's press conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoltenberg says NATO is standing firmly by its `` open door policy '' - after Moscow has demanded that Brussels rescind its prior offer of a `` path '' for Ukraine and Georgia membership : '' Today Russia raised the proposal that they published in December aimed at addressing their security concerns ; these include demands to stop admitting any new member to NATO and withdraw forces from eastern allies . Allies on their side reaffirmed NATO 's open door policy and the right for each nation to choose its own security arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not renounce their ability to protect and defend each other , including with the presence of troops in the eastern part of the alliance . '' Dialogue of last two sessions was `` positive '' : NATO called on Russia to draw down its forces from sensitive hotspots , including what the West say is `` annexed '' or `` occupied '' Crimea : The NATO side further `` expressed serious concern '' about Russia 's military build-up `` in and around Ukraine '' : The Western alliance offered to `` broaden '' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations , which for now the Russian side appears to have rejected : The NATO chief said the bloc was prepared to hold further meetings with Russia on a broad range of issues , including missiles , but said that the Russian side had indicated that they are not ready to do so at this stage . `` NATO made it clear in the meeting that we are ready to schedule a series of meetings addressing a wide range of different topics , including missiles and reciprocal verifiable limits on missiles , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made clear that they are not ready , '' Stoltenberg said . This week 's series of three meetings will wrap up Thursday in Vienna , at the Organization for Security Co-operation in Europe , which includes NATO members , Russia , and Eastern European states that are uneasy over Russia 's influence in their spheres . To review , these are the key requests Russia previously submitted to Brussels and Washington in a draft security document : In a broad outline , Russia ’ s stance boils down to three key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons from Europe , the termination of the practice of deploying NATO ’ s conventional forces near Russia ’ s borders and creating its military infrastructure there and NATO ’ s official refusal to draw Ukraine and Georgia into the alliance . In Moscow ’ s opinion , these measures will help remedy a serious imbalance in security in Europe that emerged after the break-up of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact . This will help considerably ease the military and political tension and rejoin the baseline principle affirmed by all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit in 1999 that the security of one state or a group of states can not be ensured at the expense of the security of other states . A few thoughts on the crisis from Rabobank ... Does a US that won ’ t fight in Europe and a Europe that can ’ t fight anywhere scare a Russia that can ? Equally , does the threat of US financial sanctions deter Putin when they have not stopped anyone to date and would splinter the global economy , as China would surely not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? These also seem a ‘ nuclear weapon ’ the US is unlikely to use . As such , the likely costs for Moscow are perhaps lower than the potential gains from acting on its comparative advantage —military , food , and energy— to ensure a permanent sphere of influence . In short : • If the West blinks -- and the US Secretary of State is literally Blinken -- it dismantles the global security architecture and emboldens “ revisionist powers ” everywhere . • If Moscow blinks , the status quo limps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the “ revisionists ” , and we see if the EU and White House learn any lessons in the meantime . • If nobody blinks , your 2022 forecasts are already wrong .

I told him that I had just arrived 36 hours earlier from Guam , was suffering from jet lag ( Guam is 15 hours ahead of time than Pensacola ) , and that I was sleeping in my car at Walmart . Sadly , he did n't care and just walked away , so I slept in Walmart 's parking lot again that night , just as I had the night before , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suites Hotel where I had confirmed a 30-day reservation , cancelled my entire stay , because United Airlines delayed my flight on Guam ( for which the FAA has fined them repeatedly ) , and I was a day late . I had contacted the hotel ahead of time to let them know they could bill me for the missed day , and that I was definitely still coming , but they cancelled it all , too bad so sad . JERKS ! ! ! Let 's move ahead , shall we . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redlin to tell him how excited I was to be at Campus Church and PCC . I shared my heart with him , as a friend to a friend , my Christian brother in Christ . To my sadness and grief , of all that I had written to him in my email , he zoned in on a comment I had made that I hoped to find a wife at Campus Church , actually scolding me for it . I was cut to the heart . Who was this jerk ? Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn business . I was 54 years old at the time , and disgusted that some shallow pastor would be so abusive , as to scold a grown man for desiring a mate and companion . That is shameful on the part of Pastor Redlin . But the abuse did n't stop there . I had responded to his email to rebuke him back , letting him know what I thought about his Pharisaical judgmental attitude . Sad to say , authoritarian abuse in churches today is everywhere ! I just read today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist Convention ( who has 45,000 member churches ) is now being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department for a widespread epidemic of clergy abuse . I was emotionally abused at PCC . After Redlin abusive remarks , I felt dejected and unwanted . So I emailed very kindly to ask if as a divorced man who intends to get remarried , am I welcome at Campus Church ? It was a simple question . Pastor Redlin totally ignored me for the next 10 days . I was disturbed by his poor behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Sunday morning , after church , as he and his wife greeted church members and visitors . I simply asked him why he had n't replied to my email . He backed away a couple feet , as if perplexed and a bit nervous , signifying with his open hands that he did n't have an answer . He then said , I might as well answer your question now : `` I would never perform a wedding for you if you got remarried . '' I was again cut to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed , but that he would be so rude as to say such a thing in front of his wife , which embarrassed me further . In fact , I had never asked Jeff Redlin to perform a wedding . My simple question was : `` Am I welcome at Campus Church as a divorced man who intends to get remarried ? '' He could even answer a simple question ! So I emailed him the next day to express my hurt feelings and frustration with his abusive behavior . Why was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorced and lonely , hoping to remarry ? Sadly , this is the PCC camp 's pathetic and unbiblical ways . They abuse divorced people , making them feel like outcasts , adulterers and whores . The truth is that PCC are a bunch of yuppie type academics who woefully lack God 's compassion for hurting people . Unfortunately , I experienced this type of clergy abuse firsthand at PCC 's Campus Church . In frustration , and feeling unloved at PCC , I left the church in September of 2021 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing nothing from them ( they have my contact information ) , I harshly criticized them on social media . I told everybody what Jeff Redlin had horribly done to me . But I am a loving and forgiving man , so after several months I was lonely . There is no place to go to church on Sunday nights in Pensacola , except PCC 's Campus Church . So in June of 2022 I wrote a very apologetic and sweet letter , and mailed it to Pastor Redlin , pleading for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Campus Church . He totally ignored me . So after one month of hearing nothing , I composed and mailed another letter , four times longer , again begging for their mercy , understanding , empathy for my health problems and lonely situation . I mailed the same letter to both Campus Church ( all the pastors ) , and the second to PCC . Again , they all totally ignored me . Really great people , huh ? So on August 2nd , 2022 , I had had just enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out against them on social media , again , not knowing what else to do . Only then did Jeff Redlin respond ( by email ) , to tell me that I am permanently banned from ever attended Campus Church again . I am done begging like a dog to come back to church , casting my pearl before swine . Sadly , these overpaid pastors do n't care one iota . Jeff Redlin and his sidekick Timothy Zacharias get paid outrageous salaries . Jeff Redlin 's gets paid well over $ 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't deserve that money . As far as I 'm concerned , they 're incompetent religious pilots who are crashing Campus Church into the ground , killing all the passengers ( church members ) on board . Be careful who you entrust your life to ! So , by God 's grace , I will continue to ruffle their feathers at PCC . According to an internet search , `` ruffling the feathers '' is an idiom which means : `` To irritate someone to try to get them to change . '' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do by criticizing ungodly PCC leadership and their terrible Campus pastors Church—trying to get them to change their horrible selfish and uncaring ways . God knows that I do not hate them , nor anybody else . I love people . I love everybody . That is exactly why I do write blogs like this , to get their attention at the PCC camp . They desperately need a revival at PCC how they treat other people . They need to repent ( change their mind ) about how they treat divorced people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guilt , shame and rejection . It does n't help one bit when self-righteous hypocrites , like the cocky and snobby PCC crowd , berate and ostracized them from their religious community . I want the world to know that I am not allowed to attend Campus Church , because of the wickedness of PCC leadership , who sanction the shameful behavior of their Campus Church pastors , who in my humble opinion ought not be pastors anywhere . They woefully lack God 's love for sinners . They do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or reconciliation . Those are not men of God ; but rather , mere paid employees of a secularized religious institution . PCC today is about making money , lots of money . The courses they offer are mostly of a secular nature . Religious colleges like PCC are ruining the country , not helping it . I have written numerous blogs exposing PCC , which you can search for online . They are wrong on Bible repentance . PCC 's official doctrinal position is that : `` Repentance is a change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior . '' That is WRONG ! Repentance ( Greek : metanoia ) , a noun , in fact means only : `` A change of mind . '' No where does the Holy Bible teach that repentance unto life results in behavior modification . PCC are liars ( Proverbs 30:5-6 ) . Sadly , PCC has been infected by the Bob Jones University ( BJU ) crowd with whom they are sinfully bidding Godspeed . The ungodly Harvest Baptist Church on Guam preaches hardcore Lordship Salvation , a cesspool of BJU graduates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and BJU , refusing to contend for the Christian faith once delivered unto the saints ( Jude 1:3 ; Titus 1:9-14 ) . PCC has blood on their hands , partakers of their evil deeds at BJU , damning men 's souls to Hell with a counterfeit gospel that can not produce the new birth in Christ . Jesus warned in John 3:3b that `` Ye must be born again . '' Again , I 'm just ruffling their feathers at PCC , by lashing out against them on social media . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sincere attempt to get them to change their horrible ungodly ways . You know , people just want to be loved . I even made it easy for the pastors of PCC , telling them that my criticisms are just a hurting man who is crying out to be loved , but they refuse to do so . They refuse to love me as a divorce and hurting human being , who has begged them for their love , understanding , forgiveness and a chance to come back to Campus Church to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They despise and resent me , because I dared to question the almighty gods who lead PCC . I dared to expose them . I dared to say , `` No ! '' God will judge between me and the leaders at PCC . I told THE TRUTH . I treated them with respect at first , while they mistreated and made me feel like garbage . There is no love or forgiveness at PCC or Campus Church , only authoritarian abuse . There are no second chances , no reconciliation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offend them . That is heathendom , not the ways of the precious Lord Jesus Christ ( Ephesians 4:28-32 ) . Sadly , """""""
"Over the last few weeks Sohrab Ahmari, well known as a leading intellectual exponent of a combative Trumpian conservatism, has been making the rounds explaining why he’s giving up on right-wing populism. That’s a slight overstatement; his new book, “Tyranny, Inc.,” on the cruelties of corporate power in America, bears blurbs from leading populist Republicans like Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio. But he describes these figures as “shining exceptions on the right,” whose willingness to consider interventionist economic policies contrasts with the broader trend in which populism is “turning into a niche/trashy online-media product,” with no policy content beyond resentment of elites. No doubt Ahmari’s liberal readers would respond, it’s always been that way! But part of the reason that the “Tyranny, Inc.” author and his circle earned so much attention in the Trump era is that the age of populism really did unsettle economic orthodoxies on the right."

"The Texas legislature has been preparing an all-out assault on public education, pushing a school voucher scam which would on a massive scale take away public funds from public schools and put the money into unaccountable, private, for-profit hands in the name of so-called “choice.” Many schools across the state are feeling the repercussions of the state defunding of schools, the drying up of COVID assistance in conjunction with lower enrollment. There is only one way to understand these attacks: as a full-fledged assault on our right to public education. Teachers and staff have found the odds stacked against them with low wages, more responsibilities, less planning time for lessons and outright disrespect at their jobs. But at the same time, teachers, families, and communities are fighting back tooth and nail to defend public schools and reverse the decades-long trend toward privatization.

The grandmother embraces him , checks him out , and then looks back at the sky . “ So , ” she says to the Lord , “ where ’ s his hat ? ” Today ’ s Gospel and first reading from 2 Kings teach us about how familiarity and gratitude tend to become negatively correlated , both in our own relationships with others but especially with the Lord . This tendency tests our assumptions about love , let alone obedience , and runs as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts in the Garden of Eden , where Adam and Eve lose the sense of gratitude toward God and instead intend to usurp His throne in Creation , and continues right down to the missing hat of the joke .

Paul makes that clear to Timothy in today ’ s second reading , but it is more of a subtle part of today ’ s recounting of the miracle of healing for Naaman , a mighty general of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered from leprosy , like the ten men in our Gospel reading . His wife ’ s servant , an Israelite girl , told his wife that Naaman should go to Elisha in Samaria for healing .

Naaman grew angry , expecting Elisha to personally perform a miracle or some magic to make the leprosy immediately disappear . Still , his servants convinced him to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared immediately . Naaman , a foreigner in Israel , converted immediately and wished to show his gratitude . Elisha would not accept any gift , however , as we hear in the brief excerpt of this story in today ’ s readings . Instead , Elisha allows Naaman to take two mule-loads of earth from Israel to bring home with him so that Naaman can properly sacrifice to the Lord . What does this tell us ? First , it shows that the deeper the revelation , the greater the gratitude will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to wash seven times in the Jordan to be healed ? For that matter , why the Jordan ? Naaman himself asks this in the earlier passages , angrily remarking to his servants that the rivers of Damascus were of better quality . Why not have Naaman do this closer to home , and why didn ’ t the Lord work the miracle on the first washing ? This is a lesson on perseverance , and a reminder that the Lord works in His own time rather than in ours . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that crossing the Jordan represents , especially seven times .

Elisha refuses Naaman ’ s gifts , although he accepts Naaman ’ s conversion and gives Naaman the soil he requests . Jesus , however , makes a point about the lack of such gratitude coming from the nine Judeans as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful Samaritan . What point does Jesus make here ? The Samaritan expressed his gratitude to Jesus as Naaman did to Elisha , but gave his praise to the Lord for the healing itself . That was also Elisha ’ s point — that the Lord provided the healing and Elisha was His instrument , not the source of the healing itself . In other words , Jesus isn ’ t unhappy that the other nine didn ’ t personally thank Him . He pointed out , rather , that the other nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially not the Lord who chose them to be healed through their faith . Only the Samaritan — the stranger , the presumed heretic unclean in faith as well as in body — went out of his way to proclaim his gratitude and love for the Lord . It is that gratitude and recognition of the miracle of healing , and that perseverance as well , that allows the Samaritan to be saved . The rest seem to have treated their salvation as a birthright , a trap into which the Israelites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation history . It is not enough to be born into the faith community , and it is not even enough to go through the motions of that faith . We grow numb to the wonder of God reaching down to us to save sinners , even going so far as to present His Word Incarnate to suffer the penalty of those sins on our behalf and become resurrected in perfection afterward . We fail to take the lessons of that love and instead simply take it for granted . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even to follow His commands , as the nine did in this event ( notably not a parable as presented by Luke ) . The Lord calls us to be His children and live in the intimacy of the Trinitarian life , but also to recognize it as the unwarranted gift that it is and to have gratitude for it . That is how we recognize God ’ s Lordship and reminds us what a treasure healing and salvation from our sins actually is .

""""""" Good for you . Despite dismal performances in two September friendlies that cast a pall over the team ’ s buildup to the 2022 World Cup , you ’ ve chosen to keep the faith in the U.S. men ’ s national team . You know that the team is far better than it showed in its last pre–World Cup games , that the return of Valencia ’ s Yunus Musah and Fulham ’ s Antonee Robinson will smooth many of the rough patches we saw against Japan and Saudi Arabia ; that if it plays well , it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the quarterfinals or beyond . The prevailing mood would not have you think so . The team was beyond awful in those final two tune-ups , losing 2–0 to Japan and drawing scoreless with Saudi Arabia . World Cup qualifying was an up-and-down affair , the team booking its passage to the tournament only on the final day , when it lost to Costa Rica but not by enough to fall out of the crucial place in the standings . The qualifying grind pulverized much of the hope and enthusiasm that once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the losses in September kept it smothered ahead of the tournament . The players , we were told repeatedly , were the most talented in American history . They were young and fearless and ready to take the world by storm . What happened ? What ’ s the point of an emotional investment if the team can ’ t even beat Wales ? What ’ s the point of caring if the best team the U.S. has ever produced isn ’ t yet among the world ’ s best ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know only the worst kind of sports fan demands guaranteed success , and that success has never been guaranteed in American men ’ s soccer . It ’ s OK to get excited about what ’ s merely a hope . This World Cup is not a deadline that ’ s been missed . The USMNT is not frantically assembling its team during the national anthems , hoping the effort will let it skate by with a C-minus . The conversion of potential to ability is rarely linear . The projections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated , the talent we ’ ve been waiting to unlock—have finally run into the present tense . The players have not grown into world-beaters yet ; their flaws in many cases are readily apparent . But they are awesome nonetheless , undeserving of arriving on the world ’ s biggest stage under a cloud of whiny Why Aren ’ t They Better ? questions with only some ( admittedly heart-tugging ) marketing efforts and kind of odd Ted Lasso tie-ins to dispel it . Take defensive midfielder Tyler Adams . His game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great passer , nor is he as comfortable under pressure as you would like from someone who plays in the most crowded area of the field . But he is a savant at interrupting opponent attacks before the danger has time to muster , a judo master at engaging in the off-balanced instant after an opponent has received the ball and using his quick feet and his balance to emerge from the tangle of legs with the advantage . The bet is that he adds more to their discomfort than he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a good bet . Adams is second in the Premier League in tackles , and if he doesn ’ t get you that way , then he ’ s third in fouls committed . Wind him up , drop the needle on some Iggy & the Stooges , and let him go to work making opponents ’ lives hell . His Leeds and U.S. teammate Brendan Aaronson , meanwhile , is tied for seventh in the league for fouls drawn , having been cut down more than anyone on Liverpool , Manchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaronson is involved so much because he ’ s literally everywhere , pressing opposing defenders on one end and charging back to put in a block on the other . As of a few weeks ago no player this season in the Premier League had covered more distance in a single game than he had . Earlier this year , his former coach in Philadelphia said the tracking numbers indicated he was top 1 percent on the entire globe for distance run . He ’ s scored just one goal for Leeds this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything else his effort adds . Besides , that one was the most Brenden Aaronson goal imaginable : Meanwhile , nobody needs this tournament more than the face of the team . Christian Pulisic ’ s career is stuck in neutral at Chelsea , neglected first by Thomas Tuchel and now by Graham Potter . He ’ s too coarse of a fit tactically to win a regular starting role , too talented to ride the bench , too valuable to Chelsea ’ s new American owner to be moved on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season in goals plus assists per 90 minutes ; he just doesn ’ t get enough minutes to make much of an impact for the team ’ s struggling offense . At the World Cup , he can finally show what he can do when entrusted with a team , if he seizes his chance . He won ’ t go it alone . After a year plagued by injury and absence , the team is finally , mostly healthy . ( Here ’ s to you , Miles Robinson . A nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reyna brings a different understanding of the game ’ s geometry than any of his teammates , which he unlocks with his herky-jerky , gunslinger dribbling , like Manu Ginobli walking into the frame for Sergio Leone . On the wing , Tim Weah reads seams like he ’ s Tecmo Bowl Jerry Rice and his opponent just guessed the wrong play . Forward Josh Sargent has rediscovered his form for Norwich through the one simple trick of “ actually getting played in his preferred position ” and is tied for the goalscoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward Jesus Ferreira was named the best young player in MLS , where he ’ s been elite as a passer , a scorer , and a defensive disruptor , and jumped from eight to 18 goals scored from last season to this one . ( MLS is sending more players to the World Cup than any league outside Europe ’ s big five , so you can keep your “ but it ’ s MLS ” to yourself . ) Under coach Gregg Berhalter , the U.S. has been good at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in Qatar . It narrowly lost in the Gold Cup final to Mexico in 2019 , an age so far in the distant past that Michael Bradley was still starting for the team . It won two titles in the summer of 2021 , the CONCACAF Nations League and that year ’ s Gold Cup , with two mostly distinct teams . Youthful lapses of focus and fit may have plagued it during friendlies and over the long haul of qualifying , but the players have met the occasion when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger occasion than this . The U.S. arrives in the World Cup not as the promised Golden Generation , ready to sweep all before it and avenge the qualifying failure in 2018 . This is not the second fight of a Rocky movie . It is here instead in a familiar mode : as an underdog , more than capable of springing a surprise on those who have underestimated it . Have faith , and you may yet be rewarded . """""""

In a dramatic development on Monday , two recently departed members of the district ’ s board—former president Tom Donnelly and former treasurer Korey Bailey—said that they resigned in September over the handling of a board-approved independent investigation into the attack and what led up to it . The two alleged stonewalling involving the district ’ s own legal counsel , amid a flurry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several of its employees . “ A year later , we are frozen in time when it comes to the facts ” of the tragedy , Donnelly said during a nearly hour-long press conference . Their starkest revelation , however , was that the school district had long ago adopted a threat assessment policy for preventing violence—but never used it . Donnelly and Bailey further described that they didn ’ t find out until nine months after the mass shooting about the existence of that policy , which was based on federally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This document changed everything from my perspective , ” said Donnelly , particularly as the school district continued messaging to the community that it had done everything possible before the attack to keep the schools safe . According to Bailey , the threat assessment policy , which lays out a collaborative team approach to evaluating and managing potentially dangerous behavior , was first established by the Oxford school system in 2004 . It was updated “ several times over the years , ” he said , including most recently in June 2021 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s lethal rampage . “ The district certainly didn ’ t use it as designed in the months leading up to the shooting , ” said Donnelly . “ There ’ s no evidence that we ’ ve ever used it as it is designed. ” According to the New York Times , the Oxford school district maintains that the independent investigation is moving forward , with the purpose of bringing transparency and accountability . A law firm associated with the district ’ s insurance carrier said in a statement to the Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment training before the Nov. 30 tragedy ” and that “ many of the former board members ’ allegations show a misunderstanding of the facts. ” Court documents and testimony made clear by last spring that Crumbley gave off numerous warning signs for months before he opened fire . Through various threatening communications , he signaled his suicidal despair and rageful intent to kill , including in the final days beforehand . Had the school system been operating an adequate threat assessment program , it may very well have been possible to detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late , as I detailed in a story in April : When prosecutor Karen McDonald announced murder and terrorism charges , she cited “ a mountain of digital evidence ” showing premed­itation and planning by accused shooter Ethan Crumbley…The evidence includes an ­Instagram post where he boasted about the Sig Sauer pistol he used , and a drawing discovered by a teacher the morning of the attack in which the teen depicted a shooting and wrote , “ My life is useless , ” “ Blood everywhere , ” and “ The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. ” These were textbook warning signs of both a youth in despair and an escalating plan for violence , according to Marisa Randazzo , a former chief research psychologist for the Secret Service who contributed to a landmark study of school shooters after Columbine in 1999 . “ We know and can help a student who is struggling like this , ” she told me . “ This is particularly heartbreaking , because this is a case where a trained threat assessment team would be able to do a lot. ” As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a catastrophic lack of information-sharing regarding Crumbley ’ s concerning behaviors—a pervasive problem in the history of school shootings and a core failure that the field of threat assessment seeks to remedy . Here that failure culminated in a meeting at the school involving two school officials , Crumbley , and his parents on the morning of the attack , after which Crumbley was allowed to return to class . A jury will determine whether his parents could have possibly known that he had a gun and ammunition in his backpack and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never asked about whether he had access to a weapon or sought to inspect his belongings , according to the former superintendent serving at the time . Donnelly and Bailey alleged on Monday that the district has withheld other potentially crucial details . According to the Detroit Free Press , they said those include the results from a behavioral-risk survey that Crumbley took as a freshman and again as a sophomore—just months before the shooting—that is designed to help educators identify social-emotional and behavioral problems in students . One certainty about the Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of missed opportunities will continue to come into view . That is virtually always the case amid the broader ongoing national crisis of school and mass shootings . The hope now is that the accumulating knowledge from those many lessons learned can bring about the kind of broad-based change that is necessary to contend with the complex reality of this epidemic .

Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer blamed the spreading of the `` replacement '' theory on conservative media pundits and Trump-style Republican rhetoric on immigration . `` These views should have no place in American society and certainly no place in the segments of our most-watched news channels , '' said Schumer , who called for rooting out of hatred and legislation to address gun violence .

'' Cheney was joined in her criticism by Representative Adam Kinzinger , a fellow maverick Republican who is also on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leadership for not condemning the racism that fueled the attack in Buffalo , New York , where 11 of the 13 wounded were Black Americans . `` Here is my replacement theory : we need to replace @ EliseStefanik , @ GOPLeader , @ RepMTG , @ CawthornforNC and a number of others , '' Kinzinger said Sunday in a tweet referring to McCarthy , House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and hard-line Trump supporters Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn . `` The replacement theory they are pushing/tolerating is getting people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kinzinger maintain that House leaders are pandering to Trump allies and supporters who advocate white nationalism as the party tries to take control of the House in November 's midterm elections . In a tweet on Saturday , Kinzinger said Stefanik pushed white replacement theory in Facebook ads last September that claimed Democrats planned to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants to overthrow the U.S. electorate and perpetuate their power . `` Any implication or attempt to blame the heinous shooting in Buffalo on the Congresswoman is a new disgusting low for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sycophant stenographers in the media , '' said Alex DeGrasse , a senior adviser to Stefanik . Stefanik , who represents a New York state congressional district , replaced Cheney as the No . 3 House Republican last year after Cheney condemned Trump for the January 2021 Capitol attack by his supporters .

"On the other hand, 63 percent of white voters say abortion should be at least mostly legal, a tally greatly exceeding the usual Democratic support among white voters. The economy and abortion are plainly important in making sense of recent shifts, but they’re not the whole story. Mr. Biden was relatively weak among nonwhite voters in 2020, as Hispanic voters swung to the right (by about seven points of major party vote share) and the rise in Black turnout didn’t match those of other groups. Democrats showed similar — if less acute — weaknesses with these voters in 2018 and during most Trump-era special elections. Mr. Biden’s weaknesses may exacerbate the problem, but this isn’t a new issue."

"Washington — Vice President Kamala Harris pushed back on Republican claims that Democrats support abortions up until birth, but repeatedly declined to say how far into a pregnancy abortion access should be denied. In an interview with ""Face the Nation"" on Thursday in Jakarta, Harris called on Congress to enshrine abortion rights into law after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

""Congress has the ability to put back in place the rights that the Supreme Court took from the women of America,"" she said."

The votes followed a campaign marked by discontent with persistent squabbling in the national government and by pressure to reduce the number of migrants arriving in Germany. The national interior minister, who leads the federal response on migration, suffered a heavy defeat in a difficult bid to become governor of her home state. About 9.4 million people were eligible to vote for the new state legislature in Bavaria and around 4.3 million in neighboring Hesse, a region that includes Germany's financial capital, Frankfurt. Both states were already led by the country's main opposition Union bloc, made up of the Christian Democratic Union and the Bavaria-only Christian Social Union."
"In Tyranny, Inc., Sohrab Ahmari sets out to change the narrative. He aims to persuade readers that labour unions and New Deal regulations are the stuff of American greatness, whilst mobility and profit making are enemies of the common man. He presents this project as nonpartisan, with his concluding chapters anticipating pushback from both sides of the aisle. A peek at customer reviews confirms that left-leaning readers are comfortable with his economic proposals to pad the welfare safety net and tighten the reins on business activities, however. The most fervent objection came from a reviewer who reviled Ahmari’s social ethics, a topic not covered in this book. Ahmari faces an uphill task in winning over conservatives, not liberals. His rhetoric reflects this lopsided challenge, as he laces the chapters with appeals to America’s founding and asserts an unbroken line of tradition from Aristotle to Lincoln to Tyranny, Inc. He adopts these trappings without their substance, however."

Both are vying to win the two City Council seats reserved in the Home Rule Charter for the city’s minority party. Until Brooks, that meant the Republican party.

"As government scapegoating of trans people grows, Kevin Ovenden argues that the left must fight for a politics of liberation based on the connection between class and oppression The Tories’ conference this week has seen at least six cabinet ministers reference trans or gender issues in their speeches, often tied to changes in policies. Along with the vile attacks on migrants, falsehoods about Labour supporting a tax on meat or the claims that there are ‘blanket’ impositions of 20 mph speed limits, these are attempts to use issues which they deem to be controversial to shore up their crumbling support and create ‘culture wars’ which they hope will benefit the right. Socialists should make clear that they will have a fight on their hands. In reality, however, there are signs that this will be a much harder task for them in Britain than it has been in the US, and that attitudes to individual social and ‘moral’ issues are in their majority positive for the left. On questions of controversy, however, the left needs to fight openly for its politics and not assume that these arguments are already won. One sign that in many areas there have been major changes for the better is the latest annual British Social Attitudes survey , a major study that provides a lot of insight into mass thinking on social and political questions and their trends. That is especially so this year, the 40th report since the series began in 1983. As several commentators have written, that provides a neat moment to consider how social attitudes have changed since Thatcherism appeared triumphant."

Bill Clinton has not been proven to have set foot on the island , but alleged Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre said she had seen Clinton with “ two young girls ” on the island , the Mail reported . Clinton has denied ever visiting the island or having any knowledge of Epstein ’ s crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never visited the island , and Indyke ’ s request to the Alexanders was only to confirm this .

'' MARGARET BRENNAN : We go now to Secretary of State Antony Blinken , who 's in Moldova this morning . Mr. Secretary , good morning to you . Vladimir Putin -- MARGARET BRENNAN : -- has said that sanctions amount to a declaration of war . They are impacting his economy , but they 're not stopping his military . When will sanctions stop the fight ? SEC . BLINKEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctions is already devastating , which is presumably why he said what he said . The ruble is in freefall . Their stock market 's been shuttered for- for almost a week . We 're seeing a recession set in in Russia . Consumers are n't able to buy basic products because companies are fleeing Russia , so it 's having a big impact . But at the same time , we continue to see President Putin doubling down and digging in on this aggression against Ukraine . That 's continuing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , tragically for this to go on for some time . MARGARET BRENNAN : NATO has said none of its 30 members are willing to set up a no fly zone . President Biden has been very clear . He has no interest in that or combat troops . But what more can the United States do here ? If , for instance , the Polish government , a NATO member wants to send fighter jets , does that get a green light from the U.S. ? Or you were afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLINKEN : No , that- that gets a green light . In fact , we 're talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to back fill their needs if in fact they choose to provide these fighter jets to to the Ukrainians . What could we do ? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they 're handing over to- to the Ukrainians ? We 're in very active discussions with them about that . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last couple of days working closely as always with our allies and partners at NATO , the European Union , the G7 countries , and all of us together are continuing to take steps to increase the pressure on Russia through additional sanctions , all of which are very actively under discussion and will be implemented in the in the coming days , as well as taking further steps to give the Ukrainians what they need to defend themselves against the Russian aggression . MARGARET BRENNAN : How do you convince Vladimir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime change ? How do you get him to back down ? SEC . BLINKEN : For us , it 's not about regime change . That's- the Russian people have to decide who they want to lead them and look , as I said , the challenge is this : Vladimir Putin continues to- to press this aggression . That 's why I say I 'm afraid this could go on for for some time , but is going to end and it 's going to end with- with Ukraine prevailing because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he can , the manpower , the equipment that he has that he can bring to bear can continue to grind down these incredibly brave and resilient Ukrainians . Winning a battle is not the same thing as winning a war . Taking the city is not the same thing as capturing the hearts and minds of Ukrainians . What they 've demonstrated with extraordinary courage is that they will not be subjugated to Vladimir Putin 's will to and be under Russia 's thumb . So whether that takes another week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play out , it will and I know how this is going to end . But the question is , can we end it sooner rather than later with less suffering than , you know , to going forward ? That's- that 's the challenge , and that 's why we 're trying to exert as much pressure as we can on Putin . That 's why we 're trying to do as much as we can for the Ukrainians to make sure that they can defend themselves . MARGARET BRENNAN : President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his final days . If Russia kills him , what will be the consequence ? And are you working on a contingency plan to support a Ukrainian government without him at the helm ? SEC . BLINKEN : The- first of all , let me say this , the leadership that the president Zelensky has shown the entire government has shown is remarkable . They 've been the embodiment of this incredibly brave Ukrainian people . I was just a day ago in Ukraine , at least about 15 feet into Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba . The Ukrainians have plans in place that I 'm not going to talk about or get into any details on to make sure that there is what we would call continuity of government one way or another . And let me leave it at that . MARGARET BRENNAN : I also want to ask you about another massive diplomatic undertaking , and this is the attempt to negotiate a deal to put a cap on Iran 's nuclear program . Yesterday , Russia 's top diplomat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wants you to personally give him a written guarantee of exemptions from sanctions in order to keep cooperation on the nuclear deal . Are you giving him that ? Is the entire Iran deal at risk ? SEC . BLINKEN : The sanctions that are being put in place and that have been put in place on Russia have nothing to do with the- the Iran nuclear deal and the prospects of getting back into that agreement . These things are totally different and are just are not in any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's irrelevant . The question is getting back into the deal . Clearly , if we can do it in our interest , getting out of the deal was one of the worst mistakes that 's been made in recent years . It let the entire Iranian nuclear program that we put in a box out of the box . And so if there 's a way of getting back to reimplementing that deal effectively , we it 's in our interest to do it and we 're working on that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia 's interest , irrespective of anything else for Iran not to be able to have a nuclear weapon or at have the capacity to produce a weapon on very , very short order . That interest remains again , irrespective of where we are in our relationship with Russia as a result of its aggression in Ukraine . MARGARET BRENNAN : What are the prospects for that deal and also two other aspects here the American hostages that are being held by Iran right now ? And do you see the prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on U.S. soil like they did a journalist living in New York , like they have threatened your predecessor , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ? SEC . BLINKEN : We 've made real progress in recent weeks on getting back to reimplementation of the JCPOA , the Iran nuclear deal , and I think we 're close , but there are a couple of very challenging remaining issues and nothing 's done until everything 's done . And so unless we 're able to resolve a couple of outstanding issues , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to the deal , but we 're working on it right now . We continue to believe that getting back to the deal is profoundly in our interests . Again , as I said , getting out of it was a huge mistake and letting Iran 's nuclear program out of the box . Getting back into the deal on the right terms would put that program back in the box that it was in . So we 'll see where we get in the in the coming days . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can resolve a couple of outstanding issues . If we can , we 'll get back on the deal . If we ca n't , we wo n't . MARGARET BRENNAN : But on those specific issues of stopping- stopping threats against those on U.S. soil and on releasing hostages are those two demands ? SEC . BLINKEN : So when it comes to hostages , we irrespective of any conversations and negotiations on the on the deal , that 's something we 're working constantly and we 're working on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement . So one way or another . We 're going to continue to do everything we possibly can to get detained Americans arbitrarily detained Americans home , whether it 's Iran or anywhere else . And that 's something we 're working again every single day when it comes to threats that that Iran is making when it comes to actions that it 's taken outside of the nuclear area , including activities in the region in the Middle East that are threatening to us threatening allies and partners , again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal or not . We will stand and act against those every single day . We were very clear when we were in the deal originally that nothing about the deal prevents us from taking action against Iran when it 's engaged in actions that threaten us , threaten our allies and partners , that will very much continue . So it 's not it 's not contingent on the deal one way or another . We 're doing that every day as well , and we 're much more effective doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies and partners . MARGARET BRENNAN : Mr. Secretary , thank you for your time . SEC . BLINKEN : Thanks , Margaret . Good to be with you . MARGARET BRENNAN : Face the Nation will be back in a minute . Stay with us .

"Last week Mike Pence gave a speech at Saint Anselm College that, depending on your view of the man, was either courageous or desperate — or both.

Barry Goldwater. That hopeful and optimistic primer on modern conservatism marked the beginning of the Gipper’s rise as the political leader of the American conservative movement.

""""""" Speculation regarding US involvement in damages sustained to the Nord Steam pipelines grows in the wake of an apparent threat made by President Joe Biden earlier this year to 'bring an end to it ' if Russia should invade Ukraine . ( LifeSiteNews ) – Detonations in the Baltic Sea on Monday caused serious damage to the two major gas pipelines between Russia and Germany . Experts believe that this was a deliberate , targeted attack on the pipelines , causing speculation of U.S. involvement after President Joe Biden had said in February that “ If Russia invades [ … @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nord Stream 2 . We will bring an end to it. ” A sudden pressure drop had been registered on Monday at the two Baltic Sea pipelines , Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 , which transport gas from Russia to Western Europe . According to Swedish authorities and the operating company NordStream AG , three leaks were detected at the pipes in Danish and Swedish territory – two leaks at NordStream 1 , northeast of the Danish island of Bornholm , and one leak at Nord Stream 2 , southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destruction of the pipes , which has released huge amounts of natural gas into the sea and air , as “ one of the great environmental catastrophes of our time. ” Bjorn Lund of the Swedish Seismological Center at Uppsala University told broadcaster SVT : “ There is no doubt that these were explosions ” while German research center GFZ reported that there was no evidence of earthquakes at the time the incident occurred . “ Our imagination no longer yields a scenario that is not a targeted attack , ” a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German government and federal authorities said , German news outlet Tagesspiegel reported , “ Everything speaks against a coincidence. ” Furthermore , the CIA warned Germany of possible attacks on Nord Stream pipelines weeks in advance , according to unnamed sources cited by German magazine Spiegel . The consensus among experts and politicians , that the incident was not an accident but a deliberate attack , leaves open the question of who might be behind the incident . Speculation that the U.S. caused the damage was amplified by comments Biden made in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] … then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2 . We will bring an end to it. ” A reporter then asked the president how he would do that since the pipeline is under Germany ’ s control . Biden responded by saying : “ I promise you we ’ ll be able to do it. ” Similar comments were made by U.S . Under Secretary Victoria Nuland in January when she said : “ If Russia invades Ukraine , one way or another , Nord Stream 2 will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days prior to the incident at the pipelines , a U.S. fleet participated in NATO maneuvers in the Baltic Sea and docked at numerous ports in Germany , Scandinavia , and the Baltic states .

In addition , Sikorski retweeted Biden ’ s comments from February of this year about bringing an end to Nord Stream 2 . Among people who think that the U.S. could have launched the attack on the pipelines is the journalist and editor-in-chief of Compact Magazine , Jürgen Elsässer . Tucker Carlson also commented on the incident on his Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ stupid ” for Russian President Vladimir Putin to blow up his own gas pipeline since Europe needs the gas and it is Russia ’ s biggest leverage against Europe . “ Under these circumstances , there is no chance you would blow up Nord Stream 1 or 2 ” , Carlson said . Carlson called the sabotage of the gas pipelines an “ act of industrial terrorism ” and speculated that the Biden administration may have committed it . The primetime host pointed to the glaring hypocrisy of destroying a pipeline which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters of natural gas into the Baltic Sea , ” creating a “ toxic bubble field more than half a mile wide ” from the “ president who has declared climate change is the most pressing emergency in the history of the world. ” “ The lasting damage may be to the atmosphere .

That would be the kind of thing you would do if you wanted to start a nuclear war . It would be insane. ” Moreover , Carlson cited a $ 35 million spending bill advanced in the U.S. Senate the same night of the incident which is meant “ to prepare for and respond to potential nuclear and radiological incidents in Ukraine. ” A further indication that the U.S. government may expect an escalation of the war following the attack on the pipelines , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krah , a member of the European Parliament from the German party AfD said in a tweet : Another theory about the alleged attack suggests that it could have been a so-called “ false flag ” operation by Russia , which is meant to cause uncertainty and division among Western nations and further drive up gas prices . Alternatively , Tagesspiegel names “ Ukrainian forces or forces associated with Ukraine ” as possible perpetrators . On the same day that the alleged act of sabotage occurred , the new Baltic Pipe natural gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

""""""" In a dramatic parliamentary session on January 9 , the new Iraqi parliament reelected Mohamed al-Halbousi for a second term as speaker . While the vote further widened intra-Shia divisions , it also revealed Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr ’ s ability to change political dynamics across Iraq . The Sadrist Movement , the Sunni Taqadum and al-Azim alliance , the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , and other smaller factions attended the session and voted for Halbousi and his two deputies . According to the Iraqi constitution , the parliament has thirty days from the first session to elect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will then ask the largest bloc in parliament to form a government . To date , there is no agreement between Iraq ’ s main political powers . The post-2003 system in Iraq is centered on an informal power-sharing arrangement among Shia Arabs , Sunni Arabs , and Kurds . Under this informal system , the prime minister ’ s post is reserved for a Shia , the position of speaker is reserved for a Sunni , and the president is required to be a Kurd . Halbousi ’ s election can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s bloc over the Coordination Framework , a bloc that is largely aligned with Iran . Today , the political representation of the Iraqi Shia community is clearly divided into two main blocs . The first is the Sadrist Movement , which is led by the cleric Muqtada al-Sadr , one of Iraq ’ s most visible post-2003 political leaders . The other Shia bloc is the Coordination Framework , a loose coalition of mainly Shia parties that includes two former prime ministers and other influential Shia political figures . The Sadrists claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Shia in the October 2021 election . Due to the complex nature of its coalition , it is still unclear how many seats the Coordination Framework will command . Nevertheless , it appears that they will control at least seventy seats . As the largest single party in parliament , the Sadrists voted for the reelection of Halbousi , while the Coordination Framework boycotted the vote . A similar division occurred among the Kurds . The KDP , led by Masoud Barzani , attended the vote , while the Patriotic Union of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Framework in boycotting the vote . Sadr described the vote as an important step toward forming a national majority government . Since the October 2021 election , the Sadrists have considered either trying to form a national majority government in coalition with non-Shia parties or settling for the role of Iraq 's political opposition . The Coordination Framework has only proposed one option : forming a consensus government . For Sadr , forming a majority government would mean reaching out to the major winners within the Sunni and Kurdish communities while excluding other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority government can certainly be a responsible and effective government with clear tasks , expectations , and responsibilities . However , this idea is rejected by the Coordination Framework and every major party besides Sadr ’ s . Sadr is serious about forming a majority government , which would challenge the post-2003 status quo in Iraq . At the same time , he knows that he has no guaranteed support from the other parties . While the Sunnis and the KDP joined Sadr in the vote for speaker , electing a president and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any Sadrist national majority government will depend on the support of the KDP and the new alliance between Taqaddum and al-Azim , the major political winners among Iraq ’ s Kurds and Sunnis . With the seats of another Kurdish party , the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan , Sadr could also lead a new government . On the other hand , Sadr could form a national majority government by dividing the Coordination Framework and gaining the support of Shia alliances such as the National Power of the State Coalition and the Fatah Alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any attempt to form an alliance with the Kurds and Sunnis . First , though an understanding between Sadr , Barzani , and Halbousi existed prior to the election , the KDP and the Sunni parties have so far rejected the idea of forming an alliance with just one Shia bloc . In addition , former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki , the Coordination Framework ’ s leader , has tried to create new alliances in an attempt to increase the Framework ’ s seats . This has created a balance of seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it difficult for Halbousi to claim sole leadership or representation of Iraq ’ s Sunnis . Finally , if Sadr does manage to obtain the support of the KDP and Halbousi , the Sadrists—the Shia component of the coalition—will not constitute a majority , making it the first government not dominated by Shia since 2003 . This may make it a struggle for the coalition to win the support of the Shia community . These challenges make it more likely that Sadr will try to reach out to Shia powers within the Coordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Sadrists may also consider settling as the opposition . The latter option may hold some appeal for Sadr , who has always presented himself as a renegade who holds the government in Baghdad to account . Sadr ’ s supporters , who do not question his choices , may see Sadr as a true leader who sacrificed political power for the sake of the nation . This would not be the first time that Sadr threatened to leave a government and join the opposition . What is different today is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could gain the support of smaller factions in order to create a sizable opposition bloc . If Sadr decides to take this path , he will create the most significant opposition force in the post-2003 Iraqi political system . However , there are significant barriers that likely outweigh the perceived benefits of forming an opposition coalition . If Sadr does form an opposition coalition , it will only be because he has been prevented from forming a majority government . Considering the personal rivalry between Maliki and Sadr , this outcome will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credibility . Losing out on the ability to make appointments for the thousands of senior and special posts in the Iraqi government may also make Sadr hesitate to form an opposition coalition . Controlling these appointments allows politicians to direct national policy and advance their own political , ethnosectarian , and economic interests . Being in the opposition would prevent Sadr from taking advantage of this opportunity . While Sadr enjoys a disciplined base and can afford to change his positions without losing support , he knows that his victory was largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new electoral laws . While they gained nineteen seats in the recent election , their share of the popular vote decreased significantly . For many political activists within the Sadrist Movement , especially those who worked hard during the election campaign , being in the opposition would prevent them from reaping the rewards that they believe Sadr owes them . Lastly , if Sadr is not included in the next government , the Coordination Framework and the militias aligned with it will dominate Iraq . This would allow the militias to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces without facing pressure from the government . The crackdown on illegally owned weapons that Sadr campaigned on would not be implemented , and Sadr would disappoint the international supporters who saw in him a means to reduce the influence of pro-Iranian armed groups .

"Suella Braverman’s claim that most asylum seekers are economic migrants has been challenged by an analysis which suggests that three out of four people crossing the English Channel in small boats this year would be granted asylum if their claims were processed. Using Home Office statistics on Channel crossings, the Refugee Council said that 74% of arrivals in 2023 would be recognised as asylum seekers, an increase from 65% last year. The figures contradict Braverman’s claim, made in December last year, that “70% of individuals on small boats are single men who are effectively economic migrants”."

Owned and operated by Pacific Gas and Electric ( PG & E ) , the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant is the single largest electricity producer in California . The plant produces about 18,000 GWh of electricity each year , accounting for about 10 percent of California ’ s overall energy portfolio and supplying electricity to more than 3 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2018 , state regulators approved an agreement between PG & E and a coalition of environmental and labor groups , allowing the plant to fully shutdown in 2025 , 40 years after its first reactor went online in San Luis Obispo County . Under the plan , PG & E will continue to operate in Diablo Canyon until the licenses issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for its reactor units expire . The current federal licenses are set to expire in November 2024 and August 2025 for Unit 1 and 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Los Angeles Times , Newsom said he wants to delay the closure of Diablo Canyon by tapping into the $ 6 billion Civil Nuclear Credit ( CNC ) program . According to the U.S. Department of Energy , the $ 6 billion fund is set aside in February to help avoid premature shutdowns of reactors and the subsequent loss of well-paying clean energy jobs . The federal agency encourages owners or operators of financially struggling nuclear power plants to apply for CNC money to stay in business . “ The requirement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you miss the opportunity to draw down any federal funds if you want to extend the life of that plant , ” Newsom said , according to the LA Times . “ We would be remiss not to put that on the table as an option. ” A spokesperson for Newsom later confirmed to the LA Times that in the long run , the governor still wants to see the plant shut down . Newsom ’ s comment comes as Californians continue to pay among the highest electricity prices in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information Administration , the average price of residential electricity in February 2022 in the Golden State is 25.59 cents per KWh , which is almost twice as much as the national average ( 13.83 cents per KWh ) . The news also comes as environmental groups and climate change alarmists urge Newsom to reconsider the retirement of Diablo Canyon , which they say would significantly increase California ’ s carbon footprint . “ This source of clean , zero-emissions power , avoids 7.2 million metric tons of carbon from being added to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 72 scientists , led by atomic physicist and former U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu , wrote in a letter to Newsom . “ We are convinced it is impossible to replace the carbon-free electric output of Diablo Canyon at or near the time the plants are scheduled to close . ” """""""

"FORT COLLINS, Colo. — Colorado has a new political party. The Elections Division of the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office officially designated the Colorado Center Party as the state’s seventh minor political party. In a press release, the office said the Colorado Center Party had “attained a sufficient number of registered voters to be recognized as a minor political party in Colorado.”"
"Advertisement Unlike the lower house National Assembly, the Senate is not elected by direct universal suffrage but by around 150,000 voters known as ""grands electeurs"" who include elected regional and national officials. As such, this electoral college represents a reflection of the results of local elections where Macron's Renaissance party -- only founded for his 2017 presidential campaign and lacking grass roots -- has consistently performed badly."

"The only power plant in Gaza is out of fuel. Hospitals there have backup electricity, but that’s not going to last for long. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have already been made homeless by Israel’s indiscriminate bombing campaign, with the full support — diplomatic, logistical, financial, and rhetorical — of the US government. As you read these words, desperate parents in Gaza are digging through the rubble of bombed apartment blocks to find their children, hoping against hope that they’re still alive. With a handful of honorable exceptions, support for these flagrant and escalating war crimes has been depressingly bipartisan. No one on the wing of the Right that postures as antiwar with regard to Ukraine seems to have any interest in pumping the breaks on the assault on Gaza. And most Democrats aren’t much better. When New York’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, was asked about her message to Palestinian Americans with family under the guns in Gaza in her state, she spouted talking points about “Israel’s right to defend itself” and the need for Palestinians to denounce Hamas without even a nod in the direction of human sympathy for those families. In a society less twisted by militarism and bigotry toward Arabs and Muslims, Hochul’s response would have been a major scandal. In America in 2023, hardly anyone noticed. Instead, more people seem to be talking about the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Everywhere, from mainstream media outlets to the New York State Legislature, the facts have been twisted into pretzels to portray one of the few groups consistently calling for a just and lasting peace as supporters of terrorism. The Strange Case of Shri Thanedar Shri Thanedar is one of the oddest politicians in my home state of Michigan. In 2018, he ran for the Democratic nomination for governor, coming in third behind centrist Gretchen Whitmer and “Berniecrat” Abdul El-Sayed. While Thanedar’s campaign platform was fairly progressive, the Left in Michigan lined up behind El-Sayed, with Thanedar widely distrusted. Public records showed that, in 2008, Thanedar made a substantial donation to Republican presidential candidate John McCain, which was certainly enough to raise an eyebrow or two in a Democratic primary, and he reportedly told multiple political strategists in 2017 that he “didn’t know whether he should run as a Republican, a Democrat, or an independent.” Strangely, his campaign was also marred by accusations that a company he once ran engaged in animal testing and had abandoned 173 dogs and monkeys in a laboratory. Last year, though, Thanedar managed to get himself elected to Congress. For reasons known only to himself, he joined DSA — anyone can join the organization. DSA’s open membership policy makes the distinction between being a self-selecting member and a group-endorsed politician especially salient and critical. Neither Thanedar’s local chapter nor the national organization ever endorsed his campaign. Searches for his name on the organization’s local and national websites turn up nothing; they’ve never touted his membership, a pointed omission given that he’s a sitting US congressman. But despite being officially unclaimed by DSA, Thanedar’s name frequently shows up on third-party lists of DSA members in Congress across the internet. In June, India’s extreme right-wing prime minister, Narendra Modi, addressed Congress. Another DSA member representing Michigan in Congress, Rashida Tlaib, condemned Modi’s human rights abuses and announced that she was boycotting the event. Thanedar personally escorted Prime Minister Modi to Congress for the address. Unsurprisingly, Thanedar’s local branch of DSA voted to expel him from the organization in September. Fortunately for him, this seemed to fly under the media’s radar. A couple of days ago, he was able to announce, with great fanfare, that he was “resigning” from the organization that had already expelled him, citing DSA’s alleged “moral equivocation in the face of unadulterated evil as we have seen from Hamas” and his own commitment to “Israel and its right to defend itself.” Writing in the New York Times on Wednesday, progressive columnist Michelle Goldberg uncritically repeated Thanedar’s version of events. So did just about everyone else in mainstream media. If you Google Thanedar’s name and “DSA,” you won’t find out about the expulsion vote until you’ve waded past pages and pages of reporters who simply transcribed Thanedar’s claim to have left of his own free will without doing even cursory fact-checking. To repeat for emphasis: DSA expelled Shri Thanedar last month. This month, Thanedar announced he was leaving DSA over its putative views on Israel and Palestine — an announcement that’s been picked up by the Hill, MSNBC, Fox News, Politico, Forbes, and beyond, with outlets regurgitating his disparaging statements about the organization that expelled him. That sequence of events just goes to show how careless and out of touch the mainstream media is with DSA, an organization they don’t understand and don’t care to."

"A simmering civil war among Texas’s young Republicans came to a boil this month after a prominent GOP donor was seen meeting with white supremacist influencer Nick Fuentes. Fuentes, a Holocaust denier who has fantasized on livestreams about marrying a child, took an hours-long meeting with a prominent conservative donor on Oct. 6, the Texas Tribune reported this month. News of the meeting set off a wave of accusations between factions of activist Republicans in the state. Now state lawmakers are condemning one of those factions as its members flee to a rival young Republican group. Fuentes met for several hours with Jonathan Stickland, then-president of the ultraconservative Texas donor group Defend Texas Liberty, the Tribune first reported. The Tribune also photographed Kyle Rittenhouse entering the building, although a gun rights group later stated that he was attending a meeting with them, not Fuentes. Fuentes was driven to the appointment by Chris Russo, president of the group Texans for Strong Borders. (None of the attendees have commented on the meeting.

And yet the FBI influenced Twitter and other social media platforms to censor it as “ fake news. ” Using its “ hacked materials ” policy as an excuse , Twitter systematically banned the Post story from being shared .

"The Democratic Party should hold a full presidential primary. President Biden will be 81 during the 2024 campaign. Before sending Biden to debate likely GOP candidate Donald Trump, Democrat voters deserve the opportunity to evaluate Biden’s candidacy, and a primary allows voters to consider alternatives. Normally, a party preserves the advantage of incumbency by limiting challengers. As expected, the Democratic party has tabled any serious challenge to President Biden’s nomination. Instead of experienced contenders like Senators Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, or fresh blood like Andrew Yang or Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Biden only faces the wildest of long shots. Make no mistake, party leadership has decided to keep its team on the bench. But this election is unique given President Biden’s advanced age and the consequences of a Trump second term. By not openly debating even the need for a true primary, Democrats are sleepwalking into a dangerous future."

"It is now a year since the short, disastrous premiership of Liz Truss. But when Rishi Sunak entered the House of Commons on Wednesday, politics at Westminster seemed just as disconnected from reality as during her chaotic 50-day tenure inside No 10. Tory backbenchers and ministers greeted Sunak, after their long summer break, with customary roars as he took his seat for prime minister’s questions. The more difficulty their leader is in these days, the more noise they seem to make. Quite why they were in such good voices must have been a mystery to any objective onlooker. In the week when pupils returned to class for the new school year, the government had just shamefacedly published a list of 147 state schools in England whose buildings were in danger of collapsing (having previously refused to name those affected)."

Industrial unrest, crumbling infrastructure, rising costs, a wildly unpopular government plan to close station ticket offices, staff shortages, late-running trains and the chaos around a money-burning project to build the so-called High Speed 2 (HS2) rail line – it feels like an industry on the verge of a nervous breakdown."

"CNN — President Joe Biden’s aides privately acknowledge a rematch with Donald Trump in 2024 could be his best path to reelection, but they are terrified by what would happen if he lost – which operatives on his campaign and throughout the Democratic Party worry is a very real possibility. It’s not just that voters continue to say Biden is too old or maybe not up to the job, though that keeps coming up in Democrats’ focus groups. It’s a malaise about the president that operatives keep noting that goes beyond a slew of national polls – including one from CNN last week – that show a negative view of the president’s performance."
Rachel Reeves was last night accused of a 'mad plan' that would 'strangle hope' of any real change under a future Labour government. Left-wing MPs launched a fierce assault on the Shadow Chancellor for planning to be 'even stricter than the Tories' on public spending. Ms Reeves also faced calls from the Tories to 'come clean' on how she would manage the nation's finances.
"The leader of the U.K. Labour Party, Keir Starmer, finally had the opportunity on Tuesday to prove that he is not a robot — as his critics accuse him of being — but a temperate politician capable of using setbacks to his advantage. He took to the podium to deliver the most important speech of his political career to date at the British left’s annual congress in Liverpool, the last before the next general election. “True democracy is citizen-led, politics needs an update. We demand a people’s house!” shouted an activist who rushed at Starmer and covered his jacket with glitter. With his right arm, the Labour leader blocked him from approaching the microphone as security reduced him to the ground and led him out of the auditorium. “If he thinks that bothers me, he doesn’t know me,” Starmer said, before quipping that he was glad he was the target and not his wife, “who is wearing a beautiful dress today.” Taking off his jacket and rolling up his sleeves, he added: “Protest or power, that is why we changed our party,” to an ovation from supporters. The activist, in his minute of glory, eventually became the perfect metaphor for the message Starmer sought to convey: over three and a half years, he had transformed the Labour he inherited from Jeremy Corbyn from a party obsessed with gestures and protest to one prepared to govern. In fact, it is the same recipe, the same perception among the British public, that swept Clement Attlee to Downing Street in 1945, and Tony Blair in 1997: the idea that the time has come for the British left to usher in a new era of change. Starmer described Labour as “a party no longer in thrall to gesture politics, no longer a party of protest — a party of service.”"
"2nd October 2023 In Insights Introduction In an era where social media has become a powerful platform for political discourse and activism, the narratives of extremism have found fertile ground to flourish. While right-wing extremism has been at the forefront of research and media coverage in recent years, left-wing extremism remains a relatively unexplored domain. This lack of focus on the left wing raises questions about the nature of left-wing extremism online. This Insight is based on a study that seeks to address this gap, offering a comprehensive examination of a left-wing extremist community on Reddit known as ‘tankies’. This community exhibits extremist tendencies through their unwavering support for authoritarian regimes under the banner of socialism, communism, or anti-NATO sentiments, downplaying or justifying human rights abuses."

"While wars rage in Ukraine, Gaza and other hot spots around this weary globe, a clash of a different, lower sort is shaping up, centered in my old Kentucky home between a pair of Republican titans – Sen. Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul. There is, to his credit, no more solid a supporter of Ukraine in its battle with Russia than McConnell, of Louisville, the Senate Republican leader, who is consistently urging the U.S. to send more aid to that battered nation. Paul, of Bowling Green, whose views border on nihilism and who generally believes no government is the best government, is decidedly less enthusiastic about the nation’s further involvement in the conflict. For much of the past 12 years, this Bluegrass odd couple – McConnell, the stoic insider, and Paul, the bomb thrower – have never really resided in the same political neighborhood. But they managed to paper over their differences and even sought to convince doubters that they were great chums, sharing an occasional dinner and exchanging various niceties."
"By Grace Adcox and Rob Todaro A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass appropriations legislation to fund the federal government. Lawmakers need to pass an agreement to fund the government by Sept. 30 to prevent such a shutdown, which would be the fourth over the last decade. The Democrat-controlled Senate has already passed its own bipartisan funding bills out of its Appropriations Committee and is expected to pass a full stopgap funding package with bipartisan support in the coming days. Meanwhile, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is just returning from its summer recess and still needs to debate and pass its own spending package. The feasibility of reaching an agreement by the funding deadline remains unclear as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces disarray and a litany of demands from the Republican conference. The House Freedom Caucus, a group of around 40 far-right conservative and MAGA Republican members of Congress, is threatening a shutdown by demanding steep spending cuts — even lower than the spending cap agreed upon in the bipartisan debt ceiling deal in May — and policy concessions, including defunding the Department of Justice and the various prosecutions of former President Trump and cutting funding aid to Ukraine, while also investing more than $2 billion to build and expand Trump’s incomplete wall along the border of Mexico. The Freedom Caucus has also said it will oppose any stopgap funding measure that does not end “woke” policies in the military, including restricting service members’ access to abortion and transgender medical care — proposals that Data for Progress has previously found voters largely oppose."

""""""" Liberal talk show host Bill Maher said there was a 'conspiracy to get rid of ' ex-President Donald Trump that involved suppressing the New York Post 's infamous Hunter Biden laptop story . Maher made his comments during Friday 's edition of his hit HBO show Real Time . In October 2020 , the New York Post published a highly scrutinized article alleging that Hunter 's laptop had been recovered by the FBI . The contents of the computer allegedly contained information showing that President Joe Biden 's son was attempting to sell the influence of his father . Maher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Sam Harris was on a podcast…they were talking about Hunter Biden ’ s laptop , which was a story and now all the mainstream press has finally admitted it was a real story , it was a real laptop — now look , let ’ s not pussyfoot around this , he was selling the influence of his father , Joe Biden . ' He went on : ' I mean , most political sons do . … Hunter Biden ’ s laptop was buried by the press , even the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a mistake . They buried the story because they remembered what happened with James Comey and the letter eleven days before the 2016 election . ' 'Sam Harris says it was appropriate for Twitter and the heads of big tech and the heads of journalistic organizations to feel that they were in the presence of something that is a once-in-a-lifetime moral emergency , meaning Trump , ' the former Politically Incorrect host said . 'So , he ’ s saying it ’ s okay to have a conspiracy to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Maher added . The comedian concluded : 'He ’ s saying that ’ s what they did , and that is what they did . They buried the Hunter Biden story before the election because they were like , we can ’ t risk having the election thrown to Trump , we ’ ll tell them after the election . ' Joining Maher on Friday 's show were liberal Hollywood movie directors Rob Reiner and Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar . Another director , John Waters , joined the show via Zoom from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as January 6th , abortion rights , President Joe Biden , and this week 's spending bill . At one point , Maher asked Reiner : 'It 's a little bit of a thorny question because once you go down this road- this is sort of where we are in this country , the other side is so evil , anything is justified in preventing them from taking office . Is it ? ' Reiner , the director of classics such as The Shawshank Redemption and Stand by Me , tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6th Capitol riot saying : 'You know what 's not justified ? Using armed violence to try to kill people in the Capitol . That 's not justified . ' Maher would n't let it go saying : 'Answer the question ! The question is- was it appropriate to bury the Hunter Biden- . ' Reiner cut him off asking : 'You 're talking about the press doing that ? ' The director and sometimes actor responded : 'You know for a fact that 's what they did ? I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you only watch MSNBC . ' When Reiner stated that he believed that Donald Trump would be indicted over the FBI 's Mar-a-Lago raid , Maher pounced saying : 'You know how often I ’ ve heard that on MSNBC ? We ’ ve got him now ! ' That led to Klobuchar becoming involved in the conversation saying : ' I don ’ t know that they all said this . You have to make sure you are treating people fairly . ' The Minnesota senator asserted that she wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its job . Oddly , an issue that was not raised by Maher was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg 's appearance on Thursday 's episode of The Joe Rogan Experience . The tech billionaire openly discussed the Hunter Biden laptop story on that show . Zuckerberg explained how although the platform did not completely block the story like Twitter , it was still pushed down users ' newsfeeds for as long as a week until more information came down that would indicate whether the story was true or not . He said the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not ban it entirely . The FBI told Meta employees to be wary of Russian propaganda ahead of the November 2020 election . That was around the same time the sordid contents of Hunter Biden 's computer were first reported by the New York Post - and censored by Twitter . At the time , more than 50 former senior intelligence officials signed a letter claiming the laptop story 'had all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation . ' Zuckerberg said : 'So we took a different path than Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FBI , I think basically came to us — some folks on our team and was like , `` Hey , um , just so you know , like , you should be on high alert . '' ' He went on : 'There was the — we thought that there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election . We have it on notice that basically there 's about to be some kind of dump of — that 's similar to that . So just be vigilant . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said : 'The FBI colluded with Big Tech to silence news stories weeks before the 2020 election in an attempt to control your access to information . 'Democrats in Congress have been intentionally ignoring the facts . When Republicans are back in charge , we will hold all of them accountable . ' While Texas Senator Ted Cruz said that the cover-up was 'complete corruption , plain and simple . ' Senator Klobuchar came more into the conversation when the subject switched to abortion rights . Maher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-abortion supporters 'hate women . ' Maher explained to the senator : 'The Supreme Court did you , politically , a big favor . ' He went on : 'Because for a while , people were , ' I do n't know , this really gon na get people out to the polls ? ' We have enough evidence now with these special elections and the polling , we see . And you know , who really is up in arms about this that we did n't think was going to be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of America and the men who stand with them do n't believe that politicians should be telling them what to do with their bodies . ' Again , Maher pounced saying : ' I 'm certainly pro-choice… What I 'm saying is you should n't say to the other side , 'You people hate women. ’ They do n't hate women . They just think it 's murder . ' He added : 'And if you think it 's murder , then you ca n't go , ‘ Well except for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder. ’ I do n't think it 's murder , but they legitimately do . And it insults them . ' Klobuchar rebutted : 'There are pro-life people that have the view- that 's fine . They just do n't think that they should put their views on someone else . ' Maher said : 'But you would n't say that about a murderer . And that 's what their point is . But it 's not because they had women . ' Reiner then rejoined the conversation saying that anti-abortion supporters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Maher defended anti-abortion people saying : Not everyone who is pro-life is a Christian nationalist . ' Later on the Real Time episode , director John Waters promoted his book Liarmouth : A Feel-Bad Romance . While discussing his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , Waters joked that a friend of his sent a congratulatory note that read : 'Closer to the gutter than ever . ' He added : ' I make fun of myself and the rule that I live in . I make fun of political correctness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depp 's tumultuous relationship with Amber Heard , Waters refused to go into detail other than saying : ' I wish they would get back together and make everybody crazy . ' In his round-up New Rules segment , Maher brought up the stabbing of author Salman Rushdie in Western New York last week . The comedian held up the mother of Rushdie 's attacker , Silvana Fardos , as a hero for a her response to the incident . Fardos told DailyMail.com : ' I just can not believe he was capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very quiet , everyone loved him . As I said to the FBI I 'm not going to bother talking to him again . He 's responsible for his actions . ' She went on : ' I have another two minors that I need to take care of . They are upset , they 're shocked . All we can do is try to move on from this , without him . ' """""""

"His predecessor in the role, Ben Wallace, was seen by many as one of the more competent members of the cabinet, though it must be noted there isn’t much to be judged against. His immediate predecessor, Penny Mordaunt, was in situ for a little over two months and the previous incumbent, Gavin Williamson, is perhaps best remembered for saying “Russia should go away and shut up” in the wake of the 2018 Salisbury poisonings. It would appear Vladimir Putin was not intimidated by this fearsome rebuke, as the world’s biggest nuclear power has, notably, neither gone away nor shut up. The role will be Mr Shapps’ fifth in Cabinet since being appointed Transport secretary in 2019, his CV resembling less that of a heavyweight politician and more a promising youngster from Eastern Europe who’s been bought by Chelsea and loaned out to various lower league clubs because they want to keep him on the books, just in case. But who is Grant Shapps? What makes him uniquely qualified to deal with such a massive role at a time when war is raging on the continent? And what’s up with his Wikipedia page?"

""""""" Diversity is our strength so it couldn ’ t have been too shocking that an Afghan Muslim refugee was responsible for America ’ s single worst Islamophobic killing spree . Much as another Afghan , Omar Mateen , brutally carried out the single largest massacre of gay people in America . Americans are generally fairly tolerant so liberals decided to import bigoted immigrant killers . When the migrant surge began , politicians and the media assured us that Afghans would make profound contributions to America . They have already set two particularly ugly national records . And that was bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American soldier had left Afghanistan , the fighting between Sunnis and Shiites continues in the terrorist state with ISIS-K carrying out bombing attacks on Shiite mosques.. The massive influx of Afghan refugees to America has brought the bloody ethnic , tribal and religious clashes from that failed state to America . Including the true and undiluted Islamophobia that only Sunnis and Shiites are truly capable of . “ I am angered and saddened by the horrific killings of four Muslim men in Albuquerque , ” Joe Biden had tweeted . “ While we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are with the victims ’ families , and my administration stands strongly with the Muslim community . These hateful attacks have no place in America. ” “ The targeted killings of Muslim residents of Albuquerque is deeply angering and wholly intolerable , ” Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted . “ We will continue to do everything we can to support to the Muslim community of Albuquerque and greater New Mexico during this difficult time . You are New Mexicans , you are welcomed here , and we stand with you. ” CAIR offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the “ hateful shooting spree ” and demanded that Biden make it his responsibility to “ protect Albuquerque Muslims from further harm ” . But when the perpetrator turned out to be a fellow Sunni Muslim , CAIR is no longer describing his actions as “ hateful ” , but “ deranged ” . Soon he ’ ll be dismissed as mentally ill . The media was even less circumspect , interviewing local Islamists who claimed that they feared American intolerance and the media warned that “ another Islamophobic attack could happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from “ South Asia ” , the last of them outside a Lutheran Family Services refugee services office , was indeed Islamophobic in the most traditional way . The alleged perpetrator , Muhammad Syed , a Sunni Muslim refugee from Afghanistan , was reportedly angry at his daughter ’ s marriage to a Shiite Muslim . And took it out on some local Shiite Muslims in Albuquerque which is now the new Afghanistan . Since the withdrawal , four Afghan refugees have been accused of sexual assault , two involving children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghans with terror ties have popped up on watchlists . And that ’ s just the tip of the iceberg that we actually know about . In the 6 years since he arrived in America , Syed had racked up quite a record . In 2017 , the Afghan Muslim refugee , along with his wife and son , had been accused of assaulting his daughter ’ s boyfriend . That was in 2017 . Next year , Syed was accused of grabbing his wife by the hair and throwing her out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at a Human Services office and pulled out “ a large chunk of hair ” from her scalp . That same year , his son called the police claiming that Syed had been beating his mother , while he and his sister tried to hold him back . The beating left the younger Syed covered in blood . By 2020 , Syed was allegedly busted for refusing to comply with police orders after running a red light . Police reports indicate that four years after coming to America , Syed still only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term “ mother______r ” . Syed may not have enriched our culture , but we had clearly enriched his . “ I am deeply disturbed by the killings of four Muslim men in Albuquerque . As law enforcement continues to investigate these heinous attacks , we remain clear that we stand with the Muslim community in New Mexico and around our country . Hate has no place in America , ” Kamala Harris had tweeted . Hate has a huge place here and Kamala and her boss have made plenty of room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spree wasn ’ t domestic terrorism as we understand it . The Afghan Muslim refugee , who told police that he had fought in his country ’ s special forces , was settling communal grudges and disputes the same way that his countrymen usually do . Men beating wives and family members isn ’ t unusual in Afghanistan . Neither is responding to a daughter ’ s rebellious relationship with murder . The case is only notable because it ’ s in America . And because top elected officials , including Biden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Democrats frequently remind us that other Muslims are the leading targets of Muslim terrorism . That ’ s true insofar as Islam has a rich 1,360 year history of fatally settling theological differences . The world ’ s greatest ‘ Islamophobes ’ are Muslims who have been killing each other and members of variant sects because , beginning with Mohammed , for most of their history the inherent violence of Islam leaves few other options for resolving religious differences except “ submission ” . Cultural differences end with slavery , forced marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades since the Islamic terrorist attacks of September 11 , Biden , Kamala , local officials in New Mexico and most of the country ’ s political elites and cultural establishment have learned to respond to Islamic violence with cries of Islamophobia . But what happens when Islamic violence is no longer being directed at Americans , but at other Muslims ? Americans are some of the least hateful people in America . Polls and surveys show that we are less racist , more tolerant of religious differences , and more willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they are than most of the rest of the world . And , it ought to go without saying , Afghanistan . Taking in massive numbers of Afghan Muslim refugees has had the opposite effect . Multiple Afghan refugees have already been caught up in ordinary domestic physical and sexual offenses . And that ’ s just the recent arrivals , not longtimers like Syed in New Mexico . The mass migration of Afghans to America means that we now have to police cultural , gender , and religious disputes in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our extended help over the course of two decades , settle those differences in their own country . Now we have been cursed with the even more hopeless task of trying to settle Afghan differences in America . The Albuquerque killings , like the assaults on military bases housing refugees , and the sexual assaults off those bases , is a warning of the scale and hopelessness of the task before us . From Omar Mateen , the perpetrator of the second deadliest mass shooting in America at the Pulse nightclub , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terror and death for everyone as the norms of a deeply broken culture pop up in cities like Albuquerque . Syed , who violently clashed with his family members and had repeated run-ins with the law until his violent impulses allegedly turned lethal , is not an outlier , he is the face of the future . What happened in Albuquerque is just what happens when Afghanistan comes to America . """""""

""""""" Increasingly noticeable , the major astrological event of 2022 , the Jupiter-Neptune conjunction in Pisces will be highly active from the last week of February to the end of May . It will become active again from the end of October to the end of December . The two planets will conjunct each other exactly on April the 12th , as political shifts and elections take place around this cosmic alignment . The first round of the French presidential election , scheduled for the 10th , March the 9th in South Korea , and May the 9th in the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia . Then , at the end of the year when the conjunction returns , the USA will hold its midterm elections ( 1 ) . Without attempting to make predictions – or take sides – let us ask ourselves if the encounter of these two planets has the capacity to influence the ballots and , more generally , how does it affect our destinies ? The main fact to remember is the excessive importance of emotion and its undue influence on the debates , opinions and behaviors ; the winner is unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discernment . It is certainly never quite the case ; we are not composed of cold intellects in which only rationality and logic govern our choices and decisions . Emotion makes us human , as the two masters of Pisces , the most sensitive of the zodiac signs , remind us . What would we be without the ability to be moved , and without feeling a sense of justice and compassion ? ( Jupiter ) or deprived of the urge to empathy and communion ( Neptune ) ? Unfortunately , overflowing emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : “ … . the distinction to be made between love , which is self-sufficient , and sentimentality characterized by fear and suffering is crucial . Sentimentality is the source of the unspeakable , especially if one ” genuinely ” believes to be acting for the Good . Indignation can be a superficial reaction to injustice , a way of defining oneself , of feeling virtuous and compassionate , and of filling the inner void ” ( 2 ) . This is the very danger : amplified by Jupiter , sentimentality ( Neptune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and indignation ( Jupiter ) , accounts for many opinions . Fear , anger , grief at times , and perhaps contempt overrule reason . Joy and confidence are not absent , but they move in a tight circle : people rejoice and become enthusiastic amid large partisan rallies where they loudly testify to their faith in a certain ideology and in the anticipated victory of their favorite candidate . In this context , naive beliefs , illusions and manipulations thrive ; let us remember that in a natal chart , apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be underestimated , a Jupiter-Neptune conjunction associates with emotional dazzlement ( Neptune ) and poorly offered trust ( Jupiter ) . One will be more easily seduced by denunciations of injustice ( Jupiter ) , and promises to protect the vulnerable ( Neptune ) , than by well-considered and reasoned arguments . Casting a vote for a person or for an image ? Our present-day elections involve millions of people who choose not a person in the flesh , but the perceived image of that person . Neptune , who among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the mastermind of these images which are crafted over time through articles , profiles and interviews ; this provokes subtle shifts of feelings in the public mind . A simple alteration of a properly staged image triggers a sudden sort of empathy ( Neptune ) towards a political figure who then seems more touching , more human , more intimate ; whereas a mistake , a misplaced comment , provokes a rejection , a disgrace from which it is sometimes very difficult to recover . Once again , in the context which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each playing its own tune : if the image itself , inevitably delusional , is Neptunian , its content – generally righteousness , integrity , unselfishness , and truth – is Jupiterian . The contenders are therefore altruistic ( Jupiterian ) with a mission to achieve , not in the least motivated by power , money or fame . If these are standard mechanisms in most elections , the Jupiter-Neptune conjunction greatly magnifies them . The pre-election climate is permeated by it : people argue more about the personal character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either they are seen as saviors or violently rejected . This confusion leads to brutal reactions and instinctive dismissals in a highly polarized society . This polarization arises from identification , a dangerous neptunian tendency ( 3 ) now amplified by Jupiter : even more than usual , we are influenced by the sense of belonging ( Neptune ) to one or several categories defined by social class , religious beliefs or lack thereof , ethnic origin , cultural background and even , actuality compels , a pro or antivax attitude . Neptune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion and communion , is thus found at the root of our worst behaviors : Neptunian identification feeds racism , xenophobia , intolerance , hatred and ultimately violence , brutality and war . Wrongly instrumentalized , legitimate anger against injustice ( Jupiter ) fuels this logic of identification ( Neptune ) which looks for the guilty on the outside ; it then becomes imperative to belong to a group ( Neptune ) which possesses the truth ( Jupiter ) , thereby defining oneself against the others . Neptune is very much associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secret manipulations , whether national or foreign . Jupiter on the other hand has a lot to do with frankness and truth . This mixture generates a great deal of confusion , truth and lies intermingling in a world where disinformation has become an organized and sometimes even a lucrative activity . Over the next few months , Jupiter is expected to amplify neptunian activities through hacking , troll factories , media manipulation and social networks . These activities are to be watched closely in the context of the current Ukrainian crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role : Vladimir Putin is a former spy ( Neptune ) and Russia , although traditionally Aquarius , has much to do with the sign of Pisces . The situation could very well remain confused and chaotic until the end of May More than ever , information and their sources must be assessed , because truths ( Jupiter ) and lies ( Neptune ) are more than entangled . Throughout the world this planetary context fuels the possibility of scandals , which may affect opinions and results in the countries where elections are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter encourages – through recklessness or excessive extraversion – the exposure of improperly shared secrets , again in the context of poorly placed trust . The Jupiter-Neptune conjunction powerfully influences the collective consciousness for better or for worse . Emotion is a tremendously powerful energy that needs to be felt in all its purity , i.e. , free from the shackles of conditioning , beliefs and manipulations : ” Ideally Jupiter and Neptune are associated with the genuine , fiery emotion , not conditioned by the fear of suffering , freed from lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloon of the ego is then deflated and the inner emptiness that one has fled through identifications and illusions , turns out to be the greatest wealth one can possess ” ( 4 ) . As we approach significant elections while the world continues its mad trajectory towards self-destruction , let us remember that Jupiter truly represents justice and compassion for the weakest ( Neptune ) . Therefore , it is not excluded that these next months justice and philosophy ( Jupiter ) as well as empathy and the wish for communion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slowing down at least a bit the race towards personal interests which destroys our societies and our planet . Our choices , electoral or otherwise , could consequently be more grounded in generosity , altruism and heartfelt intelligence . Ultimately , this means looking inward , no longer blaming the other , in order to understand the great neptunian principle : I am the world , and the world is me ; an awareness allowing Jupiter to unfold its principles of justice and compassion throughout the collective consciousness . To reach this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uranian intelligence are called upon , since celestial geometry is a whole , but this is another story to be told . ( 1 ) Brazil holds presidential elections in October the 2nd , with Jupiter retrograde in Aries , less than 10° apart from Neptune in Pisces .

Democrat Mark Gonzalez had been facing potential removal from office – the result of a petition drive from a conservative activist – and was about a week away from appearing at a pre-trial hearing for the civil lawsuit. Since he was first elected in 2016, the DA’s profile has risen as part of a wave of progressive district attorneys taking office around the country, with Gonzalez pursuing cite-and-release policies for minor offenses and striking a combative tone toward conservative directives from Austin and Washington during the Trump administration."
"Poland has sent the European Union an “ultimatum” demanding the extension of the bloc’s ban on Ukrainian grain imports beyond the current deadline of September 15 or the ban will be extended unilaterally by Warsaw, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on September 12.

The first offices will receive grants over a two-year period leading up to the 2024 presidential election , said Tiana Epps-Johnson , the center 's executive director .

The center 's grants will not fund offices in any of the more than 20 states where Republicans enacted laws since 2020 that ban private funding for elections , but it will go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vetoed bans passed by Republican-controlled legislatures . That includes Michigan , North Carolina and Wisconsin . Dublois said he was skeptical of the list of jurisdictions the center chose to support . The center declined to provide specific details about how it selected members of the alliance . “ It seems most of the targets for the alliance are geared towards blue states , with some Democratic strongholds in swing states included , as well , ” he said , voicing concerns that increased funding could boost Democratic turnout . Five of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up only a fraction of the total population in the more Democratic jurisdictions . The initial election offices selected are : Contra Costa and Shasta counties in California ; Greenwich , Connecticut ; Kane and Macoupin counties in Illinois ; Ottawa County , Michigan ; Clark County , Nevada ; Brunswick and Forsyth counties in North Carolina ; and Madison , Wisconsin . In Wisconsin , a perennial political battleground where former President Donald Trump has sought to decertify the results of the 2020 presidential election , Republican lawmakers tried to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veto power this spring by proposing an amendment to the state constitution that would ban private funding for elections . The proposal passed the Legislature but would need a second consecutive approval in 2023 before it could be put to a statewide vote . Madison Deputy Clerk Jim Verbick said he saw joining the alliance as a way to stay current on how other election officials are operating . He said his office will consider accepting grants and wasn ’ t worried about the city ’ s involvement drawing backlash . “ The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the courts have repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with the grants , ” he said . Top Wisconsin Republicans said they believe the program has partisan aims . “ This is just liberals telling other liberals they are doing a good job , ” said Assembly Speaker Robin Vos , the state ’ s top Republican . “ Cities like Madison and Milwaukee continue to try to find ways to only engage with and turn out certain voters. ” The center and participating election officials have stressed that the alliance ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of publicly available details about how they selected the offices and how the money will be used has fed conservatives ’ concerns . “ Our citizens should have peace of mind that the outcomes of elections are not affected by the flow of private money into election administration , ” said Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Tyler August , Vos ’ second in command who sponsored the proposed amendment to ban election grants . In Michigan , more than 460 election offices accepted grants from the center in 2020 . The state now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a voting-related ballot initiative voters passed in November . Opponents such as Jamie Roe of Secure MI Vote criticize what they see as special interest groups trying to influence elections .

The line in question noted that ten percent would be “ held by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a grand jury is looking into Hunter Biden , a witness was asked to identify just who “ the big guy ” is , according to the New York Post . The Post went on to hint that the grand jury question came after the information about James Gilliar ’ s email was introduced during the secret proceedings currently being held in Wilmington , Delaware . It has also been reported that former Biden business partner Tony Bobulinski alleged that the “ big guy ” was Joe Biden and any deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members would commonly include a percentage of the proceeds going to Joe Biden as a kickback . Joe Biden has repeatedly told the American people that he has no knowledge about Hunter ’ s business deals , that he never spoke to Hunter about any of them , and that he was not involved in any of Hunter ’ s deals .

That is false. ” Bobulinski noted that he knew things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention Joe Biden being involved in any of Hunter ’ s dealings .

""""""" Etsy has been home to many independent sellers and small businesses since its launch in 2005 . The platform has grown to a billion-dollar enterprise with a focus on handmade and vintage items and craft supplies . In February , the company ’ s CEO Josh Silverman reported that Etsy had seen its most profitable year on record , with revenue and shares at an all-time high . While this was good news for executives and investors , in a surprising turn of events , there is some less than promising news for sellers : Etsy was raising its transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 5 percent to 6.5 percent from April 11 . Etsy sellers didn ’ t take this lying down . Shortly after hearing of the increase in seller fees , Kristi Cassidy , an active Etsy seller since 2007 known for gothic wedding dresses , decided to take a stand . She headed to the Etsy sellers subreddit and wrote “ I wonder what would happen if , on April 11 , so many sellers put their shops on vacation mode that Etsy starts shitting bricks. ” Thus , the Etsy strike was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Etsy shops went into vacation mode , suspending sales for a little over a week to protest the changes . They have also asked shoppers to refrain from buying on Etsy , and their coworker campaign in support of the strike received over 15,000 signatures in a week . Around 5,000 sellers have participated in the strike , suspending business by however many days they thought appropriate . When Cassidy learned of the increase in sellers ’ fees , she went to the Reddit Etsy seller ’ s forum and said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to MarketWatch , Etsy currently has 5.3 million active sellers , which means Cassidy had her work cut out with seller outreach . The strike petition went live in the middle of March , but quickly garnered attention , and numerous sellers put their shoppers on vacation mode or paused sales . “ We ’ ve gotten a reaction from Etsy , ” Cassidy said . “ Sellers have tried to open a dialogue with Etsy , but the most we get back is a generic email saying they care about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees to better the platform , but we are trying to tell Etsy that ’ s not how this works. ” While Cassidy has considered looking into alternative platforms to Etsy , there is little available with the size of Etsy ’ s marketplace audience , and the only other alternatives would be sellers hosting a store via Shopify . The advantage to Etsy is the built-in search engine and its eight-figure users per year . Etsy originally started as a marketplace to help small business owners sell and thrive , but Cassidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be when she started has been broken . “ Etsy is not living up to its promise of what it is claiming to be , ” Cassidy said . “ There ’ s a major discrepancy between Etsy ’ s brand and selling on the platform .

Sellers are hoping to carry the strike efforts for in a different way , but if Etsy doesn ’ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a point where will have to leave the platform. ” Cassidy says that Etsy is trying to turn into an Amazon 2.0 but given that most Etsy sellers are vintage sellers and people doing handmade products , it is impractical . “ We are sellers who make things quickly , handmade , or to-order , we are not mass-market producers , ” Cassidy said . “ Our products are unique. ” While the transaction fee seems to be the major gripe of sellers , it goes beyond that . Etsy can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with additional fees including the listing fee to post products on Etsy , a payment processing fee for processing payments , and a fee for offsite ads that ’ s around 12 percent . “ The real reason the transaction fee led to so many Etsy sellers striking is that it was our final straw , ” Cassidy said . “ Etsy is not providing a service worth 5 percent right now , and they are raising it to 6.5 . This pushed sellers over the edge , and we ’ ve had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a union for the Etsy sellers , although nothing is set in stone yet . Cassidy ’ s hopes Etsy will meet sellers ’ demands to keep the seller fee at 5 percent , allow sellers to opt out of expensive off-site ads , and provide better customer service support for shops . Balmung Furuya , an Etsy seller who sells 3-D print Dungeons and Dragons figurines , decided to launch on Etsy because the nature of the platform brought in many more customers than when he was trying to run his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squarespace was more customizable and he had more control , the volume of his Etsy shop is ten times what it was via Squarespace . “ With Squarespace , I ’ ve had a total of 15 sales trying to actively push the site , whereas with Etsy I ’ ve broken 1,400 sales , ” Furuya said . While he ’ s fairly new to the platform only having joined in 2020 , he says from the time he started with Etsy until now one of the things he ’ s noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he got started with Etsy during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic , he was very forgiving about it because nearly every business faced issues during COVID-19 , but it ’ s gotten progressively worse . “ I needed proper help with a legal issue earlier this year , and it took me two months to get a response , ” Furuya said . “ When I heard about the increase in seller fees , I didn ’ t think the price was that much , but they are claiming the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I ’ ve only seen that get worse . I don ’ t see how that fee increase is related based on how customer service for sellers is going. ” Furuya ended up putting his shop on vacation mode for five days to protest the fee increase . He had decided to shut down his store for a day to boycott the fee increase before he learned about the protest , but once he saw more collective organized efforts he was on board . Furuya says his only real hope for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to consider the needs of their sellers . “ Etsy seems very against their seller base , ” Furuya said . “ While I don ’ t know exactly what I want to see , I ’ d like some more genuine support from the customer service team . Some better communication would be better , and while I ’ d prefer a decrease in prices , if the services for sellers were there it would be different. ” Although Furuya says if Etsy sellers were to unionize , he would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pros and cons , he also says the rhetoric that unions are bad that ’ s been driven in America is propaganda . Although he says pausing his store was scary , his customers immediately returned once his shop was active again . Brooklyn-based costume and swimwear designer Courtney Gamble , founder of MessQueen New York , has been an Etsy seller since 2010 . She joined Etsy because she found the platform seamless , but over the years she ’ s found it increasingly frustrating to use . “ Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show up in the listings , it can be very time consuming , ” Gamble said . “ I ’ m constantly fixing my shop , product titles , and tags . I understand they are trying to streamline the search optimization , but I wish it was a little bit easier and it ’ s not realistic for me with 300 plus listings. ” Gamble says that while Etsy says they are trying to do the best for their sellers , she no longer believes that because “ everything is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In September 2021 , Etsy launched its Star Seller program , which was to let shoppers know what sellers offer consistently excellent customer service . While this sounds great in theory , it has proven to be a nightmare for sellers like Gamble . “ It is unrealistic for small shops to live up to the standards of the Star Seller program , ” Gamble said . “ Etsy expects us to message people back in 24 hours , or it lowers your qualifications and percentage points to be a Star Seller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Seller , and it ’ s very unclear as to what even qualifies you to be a Star Seller . My sales were slow in winter , and I still made star seller , so who knows ? ” Gamble , unfortunately , had to raise her prices to compensate for the increase in transaction fees , and she feels guilty passing the cost onto her customers . “ Etsy expects us to add onto our costs and have the customers pay for it , but that ’ s not a guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ ve had customers tell me : ‘ This is too expensive now ; I ’ ll just find something similar on Amazon. ’ ” Gamble said if Etsy sellers were to form a union , she would look into it , and she ’ s hoping there will be some form of protection for sellers soon . “ The sellers ’ concerns need to be at the forefront of Etsy because without us they don ’ t have a marketplace , ” she said . Rebekah Grippen , an Etsy seller focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started selling on Etsy in 2017 . Previously , she had been an Etsy shopper since 2006 . When Grippen began as an Etsy seller she didn ’ t notice the extra fees at first because she was just happy to be making sales and income .

One of the first big changes that got her was Etsy ’ s free shipping program which prioritized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes it as a “ nightmare ” for small businesses because the threshold for free shipping is 35 dollars . “ For sellers who opted into the free shipping program , anything over 35 dollars was free shipping , ” Grippen said . “ The problem with this is customers could combine items that weren ’ t individually 35 dollars to get to the amount of 35 dollars , and then sellers would make no money because it would all go toward shipping. ” Etsy pushed sellers like Grippen to raise the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of items onto customers . Grippen says this was unfair to her international customers because “ International customers would be buying items and paying for both U.S. shipping on top of international shipping . 1/4 to 2/3 of my customers are international , and this would alienate them . I love my international customers because they leave me great reviews , and I don ’ t want to risk losing them. ” Grippen ’ s other grievances with Etsy are she did not even receive a tax form from them this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do more than $ 600 in sales . This forced her to manually calculate all her Etsy income , making tax season very tedious for her . She learned about the Etsy strike from her mother , who read about it in a Buzzfeed article .

She currently describes dealing with Etsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” She also says that while many news outlets are saying the strike is due to the fee hike , the fee was truly the last straw . Between the stress of free shipping and trying to make the Star Seller program , sellers have had enough . Etsy user Kittynaut is known for her anime-inspired accessory pins .

Kittynaut became frustrated with Etsy in 2015 when the platform raised its transaction fees from 3 percent to 5 percent .

Customers are mad as well because they come to Etsy expecting handmade products , next thing they know , they get a product on their doorstep from a reseller with a Made in China label somewhere on it . Customers feel tricked . Resellers are causing undue trust issues with buyers in some sense. ” Kittynaut says nowadays most of her traffic actually comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instagram , to drive traffic to her Etsy shop . She says that since Etsy went public in 2015 , she ’ s seen nothing but raised fees , increased costs for sellers on shipping , and increased costs for offsite ads . She saw the Etsy strike as something a long time coming . After years on the platform and now being established , Kittynaut says that it would be virtually impossible for her to start from scratch on Etsy now . “ When I look back at where I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken into this space easily with how Etsy is set up now , ” she said . “ I think about how unfair that is for younger artists , and I want to be able to shield and protect them from those problems. ” Recently , members who participated in the strike appeared to be targeted by union busters . According to Grippen , members received a suspicious email from a private research firm starting on April 20 trying to dig up data and info about strike participants . The group doing research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their clients were all large corporations . Grippen says that she and fellow strike participants are suspicious it is Etsy or a competitor and the insights could be used to harm their movement . “ We ’ ve seen similar things happen at Amazon , ” she said . While the formal Etsy strike is over , the sellers ’ fight is far from over . One of Kittynaut ’ s biggest grievances is around how Etsy is run on a corporate level . She recently began reviewing Etsy ’ s SEC reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonuses and offered multi-million dollar severance packages . Her big question is why that money isn ’ t going toward investing in sellers .

""""""" Last updated on .From the section FA Cup Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says not many players in world football could have scored Phil Foden 's goal in the 4-1 win at Southampton . This FA Cup quarter-final turned on Mohammed Salisu 's reckless challenge on Gabriel Jesus that saw Kevin de Bruyne restore City 's lead from the penalty spot after 62 minutes , effectively ending Southampton 's challenge . Foden came off the bench to score a magnificent third and Riyad Mahrez rounded the afternoon off with 12 minutes left . Guardiola claimed Foden and Mahrez made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . Speaking about the 21-year-old England international 's goal , the City boss said : `` A few , there are not many but a few , he is one of them who has [ the ability to score from there ] . `` He has an incredible shot , he 's quick , fast , he 's a fantastic player - we know it .

They are incredibly organised and in front of the ball they are so aggressive and of course have a good build-up . `` But after 2-1 , the second half we were much much better and in the end the quality from Phil and Riyad made the difference . '' City will face Liverpool for a place in the final , while Chelsea take on Crystal Palace in the other semi-final . Man City get the job done Manchester City ran out emphatic winners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in De Bruyne 's penalty they were threatening to pay a price for carelessness in possession . Once De Bruyne had scored , however , City showed the quality and ruthlessness that has put them at the top of the Premier League and still in contention for the FA Cup and Champions League . Manager Pep Guardiola can also introduce such strength off the bench , illustrated by the contributions from Foden and Mahrez . Foden 's 75th-minute goal was a thing of beauty , a rising drive from 20 yards that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around St Mary 's once he struck with his left foot . Mahrez scored one goal and could have had more but once again the great orchestrator was man-of-the-match De Bruyne , pulling the strings and stepping forward to beat Fraser Forster with a penalty that put City back in charge . The fact that City can win so convincingly without touching the heights they are capable of will sound an ominous warning to anyone wanting to deprive them of any of those three major prizes they will contest between now and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving as good as they were getting until Salisu 's unnecessary tackle on Jesus , hardly in a dangerous position and with the game in the balance . City gratefully accepted the gift and a vibrant atmosphere inside a packed St Mary 's was instantly subdued as if both Southampton 's players and fans sensed this was the decisive moment . And so it proved as City took advantage of deflated Saints , who had played with so much energy and deserved so much credit for that first 62 minutes , even hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The high-intensity style that has made them such difficult opponents for so many teams this season was rushing City into errors in possession , one of which required a fine save from keeper Zack Steffen moments before De Bruyne put the visitors back in front . Saints might even have scored a second equaliser when substitute Che Adams ' point-blank effort was blocked by Steffen but this was an FA Cup quarter-final that had its destiny decided by Salisu 's challenge . This is not to say Southampton would have gone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis of the tie and Ralph Hasenhuttl 's team had handed the initiative back to Manchester City , never the best of ideas .

""""""" If President Joe Biden gets his way , the Democrats ’ presidential primary schedule is about to undergo a major shakeup . Biden has proposed making the South Carolina primary the first in the country , supplanting the New Hampshire primary and the Iowa caucuses . The Democratic National Committee ’ s Rules and Bylaws arm approved the change on Dec. 2 , and the question will be put before the full DNC when it meets in February . If approved , South Carolina would be followed by New Hampshire and Nevada the following week , with Michigan and Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for South Carolina going first is in large part an expression of gratitude to the state that rescued his presidential campaign after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire . But the sales pitch is that the early primary states need to be more racially diverse to better reflect the demographics of Democratic voters . Most Democrats seems to be onboard with rethinking the order of the states , especially following the disastrous Iowa caucuses in 2020 . There is less enthusiasm , however , for making South Carolina first . Let ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first : According to a Pew Research analysis of validated 2020 voters , 85 percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump were white while that was the case for just 61 percent of Biden ’ s voters . Meanwhile , 30 percent of Biden ’ s voters were black or Hispanic compared to 10 percent of Trump ’ s voters . Given this , Iowa and New Hampshire—two of the whitest states in the country at 85 and 88 percent , respectively—make sense for the first Republican primary states in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Democrats . The voters Democrats need most to win the White House are basically boxed out of those all-important early primaries where campaigns are often made or broken . A better way to get a feel for whom Democratic voters want as their nominee is to present the question to a better representative sample of those voters . For the last thirty years , the Democratic presidential candidate who won black voters ultimately won the party nomination . In particular , the preference of black Southern voters , who tend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices , has proven prescient . In the 2020 South Carolina Democratic primary , exit polls showed that 56 percent of the voters were black and Biden won nearly two-thirds of them on the way to victory . In Nevada , where , according to the entrance polls , 17 percent of the caucus-goers were Hispanic and 11 percent were black , Biden finished a distant second to Bernie Sanders . Put it another way : In Iowa , New Hampshire , and Nevada , before people of color weighed in in significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Elizabeth Warren were top-three finishers ; as soon as the electorate diversified , their campaigns withered and were soon suspended . Changing up the initial states could quicken the identification of the nominee , which could help in preparing for the general election . But such an approach is not foolproof . If this proposed state order had been in place in 2008 , it is quite possible that Barack Obama may have lost the nomination . Going into the primaries , Obama was trailing Hillary Clinton by 14 points in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisting that the most viable candidate should get their support—were unwilling to take a chance on the newcomer , even if he was black and charismatic . But when Obama pulled out a surprise victory in the Iowa caucuses , showcasing to those black voters that he could win over white voters and thus was eminently viable as a nominee , South Carolina swung heavily in his favor—Obama went on to win black voters there by 60 points . Without that Iowa victory in his back pocket , coupled with a narrow second-place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have convinced enough black voters to win South Carolina , which might ’ ve doomed his chances . It may be an uncomfortable truth , but for minority candidates to win the White House ( or Senate , governor , and other statewide elections ) , they must win white voters . Demonstrating the ability to do so is absolutely essential . There are those who think the proposed changes to the primary calendar are misguided . Some observers think starting with South Carolina is a mistake because Democratic presidential nominees aren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic presidential candidate has not won South Carolina in the general election since Jimmy Carter in 1976 . ) New Hampshire and Iowa are particularly peeved at the prospect of missing out on the benefits that come with being the first primary states , not the least of which are the enormous amounts of political spending and prolonged media attention . And the progressive wing of the party may resent having to win in more moderate Southern and Midwestern states early on . Democrats will need to determine which of the following gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominee who can win the White House : Southern black voters who have a keen sense of a candidate ’ s national viability ; battleground state voters ; states where the Democratic primary electorate most resembles the national electorate that remains three-quarters white and 20 percent black and Hispanic ; or states that lean ideologically more to the left or tack towards the center . The decision isn ’ t just a matter of which internal party interests win out but a determination of which sorts of candidates have the inside track to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the DNC ’ s vote in February will be the latest and best indication of the preferences of the party ’ s elites and its near-term future .

'' However , the claim about passing out from picking up an object with fentanyl on it has been widely dismissed by experts before .

He said : `` People do overdose accidentally , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and either not expecting fentanyl or carfentanil , or something like that , or people who get an unknown dose because they are buying drugs from the street , so overdose that way .

"What turned up the dial on violent fantasies among this sorry group? The short answer is obvious after the first round of speeches and conversations: It is the indictments of Donald Trump. For this crowd, Trump’s multiple arrests and indictments are not a setback; they are proof positive of their fondest fears. They show, in effect, as other T-shirts pronounced, that “Alex Jones Was Right,” and “Roger Stone Did Nothing Wrong.” More than that, the Trump indictments have lent the group a political focus and meaning that far transcends their marginal status. In another time, ReAwaken America could have been laughed off as just another festival of snake-oil hucksterism in the long American tradition of separating suckers from their money through entrepreneurial grifting. But this group sees itself as the heart and soul of the modern Republican Party. And to some degree, they are right about that. The undisputed champion of the Las Vegas crowd is Donald Trump. You were less likely to hear a bad word about Trump than about Jesus. And Trump happens to be the front-runner—by far—in the race for the Republican nomination. The runners-up in the Republican contest are notable mainly for promising to pardon Trump and/or fill his mighty shoes. Majorities of Republican voters continue to believe in the Big Lie that the 2020 was stolen and that Trump’s indictments are just political persecution from a “weaponized” system of justice."

"Joe Fathallah, Cardiff West Socialist Party September marks the 50th anniversary of the 1973 coup in Chile led by General Pinochet, which overthrew the democratically elected left-wing government of Salvador Allende, and ushered in 17 years of brutal military dictatorship. On 4 September 1970, Allende was elected Chile’s president as the leader of the Popular Unity (UP) coalition. Allende’s government was headed by the Socialist Party of Chile and the Communist Party. Allende was elected on a radical platform and set about implementing reforms such as an increase in the minimum wage, a free school meals programme, and redistribution of agricultural land. Following this, the new government embarked on a programme of nationalisation. The US-owned copper industry and a large part of the banking sector were brought into state ownership. By the start of 1972, all the mining companies and 68 other firms had been brought over into the public sector. Huge enthusiasm existed among the Chilean working class for Allende’s government, which had, in a short period of time, overseen a significant increase in living standards."

"In the summer of 1956, the United States Congress passed a joint resolution calling for — and President Dwight Eisenhower issued a proclamation establishing — the recognition of “Constitution Week” following Sept. 17 of every year to commemorate the signing of the U.S. Constitution in 1787. Not content to simply do the bare minimum, Utahns have gone the extra mile: Earlier this year, the Utah State Legislature passed, and Gov. Spencer Cox signed, a law establishing September as “American Founders and Constitution Month.” I am happy to see the state of Utah commemorate what British Prime Minister William Gladstone called “the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.” Its creation was, as Washington wrote to Lafayette, “little short of a miracle.” However, I worry that many Utahns, and Americans more generally, do not understand what makes the creation of the U.S. Constitution worth celebrating. President Dallin H. Oaks, a former Utah Supreme Court Justice and now first counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, has recently recalled a conversation he had in the 1960s with a fellow law professor that I think is worth noting. When President Oaks was at the University of Chicago Law School, one of his colleagues reported that when he had previously been a professor at the University of Utah Law School, many of his students “seemed to believe that the Constitution was divinely inspired … but none of them could ever tell me what this meant or how it affected their interpretation of the Constitution.”"
"Meanwhile, Republican politicians use this form of identity politics to win elections and then, when in power, fight for deregulation and lower taxes on corporations, a policy agenda that’s not even popular among their own voters. As liberals have been pointing out for decades, “white rural patriotic Christian” is an identity, no less so than any of those that progressives champion, and the fact that those who hold that identity imagine themselves to simply function as the default is precisely what members of disadvantaged groups must organize against. Though the term “identity politics” is typically hurled against progressives, in the 21st century the right plays identity politics just as much as the left. Indeed, today’s conservatism seems to have little else than identity politics, a politics of pure resentment, disdaining one imagined identity (the stereotypical “woke” liberal, overeducated, sanctimonious, hypocritical, and ignorant) and lionizing another (the all-American, proudly provincial, gun-toting, flag-waving defender of traditional values). Right-wing media has precious little to do with policy these days, as the right’s biggest stars achieve that status merely by goring the proper ox — defining the most over-the-top liberal stereotype and skewering it, again and again, creating a kind of anti-politics.

So here you have the historically very leftist paper reporting on the leftist political party, and the fact that it has reset its position on what's identified here as sex and gender, but it's done so in order to try to keep it quiet. Indeed, the head of the party didn't come out and make any announcement. Instead, he sent out a person known as a shadow minister with a low public profile. Now, what's a shadow minister? Well, this means that if you're the opposition party in Britain, especially of the two major parties, the Tories or the so-called Conservative Party on the one hand currently holding majority in Parliament, but that majority very much threatened by shifts in public opinion, and by the way the Conservatives have governed over the course of the last few years."

NOW POLICE WERE ON HAND KEEPING BOTH SIDES APART AND KEEPING THE Advertisement Supporters of Palestine met by pro-Israel counterprotesters in Cambridge, Massachusetts Share Copy Link Copy A group of Palestine supporters holding a demonstration in Cambridge, Massachusetts, were met by a group of pro-Israel counterprotesters Monday evening.Several hundred people who showed up to a pro-Palestine rally outside City Hall were met by dozens of Israel supporters who shouted them down from across the way on Massachusetts Avenue.The supporters of Israel called the violence from Hamas over the weekend terrorism, while the demonstrators on the other side called for Palestinian statehood in the wake of the escalating conflict in the Middle East.""Any deaths are tragic, and we need to understand that the forces that are driving this conflict in the first place are coming resolutely from the U.S. government's support of the Israeli apartheid regime,"" Jeff Rosenberg, a member of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, said.The hundreds of Palestine supporters then marched through the streets of Cambridge after the City Hall rally.Cambridge police officers were on hand to keep supporters on each side separated from each other, and there were no reported issues.The Cambridge demonstration was held hours after more than 2,000 people attended a pro-Israel rally on Boston Common, including several members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation.""De-escalation is not possible when they are taking hostages. Israel did not ask America to de-escalate on Sept. 12, 2001,"" said U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss.Supporters of Israel and of the Palestinians held competing rallies in several U.S. cities, including in New York, where rival protesters shouted at each other near U.N. headquarters amid a massive police presence.Several thousand people rallied in Paris in support of Israel, marching to the Trocadero Plaza overlooking the Eiffel Tower. The monument was lit up in the colors of the Israeli flag, with a white Star of David in the middle, in a gesture of solidarity announced by Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo.In Athens, an estimated 250 people, mostly Palestinian expatriates and members of Greek left-wing groups, held a peaceful protest outside the Israeli embassy to show solidarity with Palestinians. Protesters waved Palestinian flags and chanted slogans, while a strong police contingent blocked off access to the embassy building.In London, hundreds chanted “Israel is a terrorist state” and “Free Palestine” and some waved signs calling for Israel to “end the occupation.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared on Monday that Israel's fierce offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip has “only started.”Netanyahu delivered the pronouncement in a nationally televised address as Israel pressed ahead with a third day of heavy airstrikes in Gaza following Hamas' unprecedented and deadly incursion into Israel.“We have only started striking Hamas,” he said. “What we will do to our enemies in the coming days will reverberate with them for generations.”Israel formally declared war on Sunday. The hostilities so far have killed around 900 people in Israel and more than 680 people in Gaza, according to authorities on each side.At least 11 U.S. citizens have been confirmed dead in the surprise Hamas attacks, U.S. President Joe Biden said Monday.Biden also said the U.S. government believes it is “likely” that Americans are among those currently being held hostage by Hamas militants, while other U.S. citizens are still unaccounted for after the deadly assault.“My heart goes out to every family impacted by the horrible events of the past few days,” Biden said in a statement. “The pain these families have endured, the enormity of their loss, and the agony of those still awaiting information is unfathomable.”He stressed that the State Department is offering assistance for U.S. citizens who are currently in Israel, and air and ground options to leave the country are still available for those who choose to do so. He also said federal law enforcement officials are “closely monitoring” potential domestic threats stemming from the weekend attacks.As retaliatory Israeli airstrikes continue, more than 187,500 people have been displaced in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, according to a report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, is hosting more than 137,000 people in schools across the territory. The report says airstrikes have razed 790 housing units and severely damaged 5,330 in the territory of 2.3 million people.OCHA said damage to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in Gaza has disrupted service for more than 400,000 people.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Monday that he and U.N.

"Just shortly after midnight on Friday morning, Dianne Feinstein, the senior United States senator from California died at age 90. Now, this is a big news story, but it's not exactly unexpected. Over the course of the last couple of years, there's been a notable decline in Senator Feinstein's health, also in her mental acuity. There had been even people within her party who had called for her to retire. And her concession was to say that she would not run for reelection in the 2024 election cycle there in California. That set the stage for what would be then an open seat according to that theory if Dianne Feinstein had lived through the remainder of her term. And that open seat is already hotly contested in the only place that it really matters, which is in the Democratic Party and in anticipation of a Democratic primary. Now, that entire picture is scrambled, and it's going to be very interesting to see what happens because California's very democratic, very liberal governor, Gavin Newsom, had pledged to appoint a Black woman who would be the first Black woman United States senator from the state of California. Now, there you have identity politics and political ideology all mixed together in what could also be described as a political payoff, but it really does restrict the governor. He has restricted himself. If you live by identity politics, you'll die by identity politics. And Gavin Newsom is now in a genuinely excruciating political situation because if he does name an African American woman as an acting senator, that is to hold the position until there can be an election in 2024, he will be seen to have given that candidate a sizable advantage in the Democratic nomination race for 2024. He's in a very tight position. He put himself in that position. No sympathy to him, but we're just making the political observation, which is also simultaneously a moral observation, and that is that if you tie yourself to identity politics, guess what? You are tied to identity politics. We'll be watching to see what Governor Newsom does. But it's really important that we look back at Senator Dianne Feinstein's life and understand there's some really big lessons for us there."

"We learned in 2016 that voting negatively, to defend against a bogeyman, is rarely as motivating as voting positively, for a concrete cause. A 2019 report found that ?“there is no evidence supporting common wisdom about negative campaigning representing an effective strategy for maximizing votes.” And there is considerable evidence that negative, personality-based attacks poison the political waters, motivating Democratic and Republican partisans to become more entrenched in their allegiances to corporate-dominated parties and candidacies, even as independent voters and the politically disenchanted sour further on the electoral system. But if President Biden and the Democrats want to defeat Trump and his MAGA movement, along with highlighting the dangers of a vindictive demagogue winning in 2024, they will need to run on a positive platform which would improve the material lives of working people. Central to that program should be taking on the fight to eliminate student and medical debt. It is worth reminding voters of all the ways that Trumpism imperils our freedoms. If he becomes the Republican presidential nominee, Trump threatens to impose frightening changes like the revocation of birthright citizenship and instituting Schedule F , which would purge the federal bureaucracy of 50,000 career civil servants and replace them with far-right extremists and allies.

"WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON TODAY DOWN THERE. ASHLEY. GULSTAN DART EDIE HERE IN ANAHEIM. WE’RE SORT OF IN THIS DOWNTIME IN BETWEEN HEARING FROM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND EVEN LEADING UP TO THIS WEEKEND, WE HAD HEARD THAT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS THE FAR AND AWAY RUNNER IN THIS RACE. BUT EVEN IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA EARLIER TODAY WITH THE TURNOUT, WE CERTAINLY SAW THE POWER THAT HE HAS OVER THE PARTY IN THIS STATE. CALIFORNIA HAS AN EARLY PRIMARY ELECTION IN MARCH, AND THE LARGEST SHARE OF REPUBLICAN DELEGATES TO DETERMINE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. SO TRUMP CAME HERE TO MAKE HIS PITCH TO CALIFORNIA VOTERS. WE KNOW THAT TRUMP TRADE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS ON THE TRUMP TRAIN. THE FORMER PRESIDENT HEADLINING THE GOP CONVENTION WITH 1500 PEOPLE PACKING THE ANAHEIM MARRIOTT TO CATCH HIS SPEECH. THE CROWD SO BIG IT TOOK HOURS FOR SECURITY TO SCREEN. HUNDREDS STANDING IN LINE SO LONG, THE PROGRAM RAN AN HOUR AND A HALF BEHIND THE CROWD’S ROAR WHEN HE CAME ON STAGE, A SIGNAL THAT SUPPORTERS SAY HE WAS WORTH THE WAIT. UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WE WILL BRING BACK LAW AND ORDER TO CALIFORNIA. THE FORMER PRESIDENT PROMISING TO CRACK DOWN ON CALIFORNIA’S ELECTION SYSTEM AND PROSECUTORS WHO SERVE IN WHAT HE SAYS ARE CRIME RIDDEN CITIES. HE WENT AS FAR TO SAY RETAIL THIEVES WILL BE SHOT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. HE BLAMED DEMOCRATS FOR THE STATE’S DEMISE. TOGETHER, WE WILL REVERSE THE DECLINE OF AMERICA AND WE WILL END THE DEATH SECRETION OF YOUR ONCE GREAT, GREAT STATE, CALIFORNIA. THIS IS NOT A GREAT STATE ANYMORE. THIS IS A DUMPING GROUND. YOU’RE A DUMPING GROUND. THE WORLD IS BEING DUMPED INTO CALIFORNIA FOR PRISONERS, TERRORIST S MENTAL PATIENTS. YOU HAVE MENTAL INSTITUTIONS. CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS SAY THE PARTY WILL OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORT HIM IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION. I WOULD SAY OVERWHELMINGLY WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I MEAN, THE REALITY IS THIS NO MATTER HOW YOU CUT, SLICE AND DICE, IT, DONALD TRUMP IS BY FAR AND AWAY SO FAR AHEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU. HERE IS SOMEONE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE BEHIND. CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS COULD SEE SPEAKING TO THEM. I’M NOT AT THEM. NOW. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HERE TODAY HAVE BEEN IN SUPPORT SO FAR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, THERE ARE OTHERS IN THE PARTY WHO DO NOT FEEL THIS WAY AND WANT A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE THAT OTHER CANDIDATE FOR SOME IS RON DESANTIS, WHO IS SPEAKING HERE IN JUST A MATTER OF HOURS. BUT TO PUT IT INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR YOU, WE’RE HEARING FROM PARTY OFFICIALS THAT ABOUT LESS THAN 1500 TICKETS WERE SOLD FOR DONALD TRUMP’S EVENT IN A HUGE BALLROOM. WE KNOW DESANTIS EVENT IS IN A SMALLER ROOM AND SOLD ABOUT A THIRD OF THE TICKETS THAT TRUMP DID. WE WILL HAVE SO MUCH MORE ON THIS LATER TONIG Advertisement Trump animates California Republicans with calls to shoot people who rob stores Share Copy Link Copy In an occasionally dark and profane speech, Donald Trump on Friday sought to win over Republicans in California by complaining that rich people in Beverly Hills smell bad because they're denied water, reiterating lies about widespread election fraud and calling on police to shoot people robbing stores.While many of his remarks at the California Republican Party convention in Anaheim were familiar retreads of Trump's attacks and grievances, his encouragement of violent retribution against criminals marked an escalation of his longstanding tough-on-crime message.“We will immediately stop all of the pillaging and theft. Very simply: If you rob a store, you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store,” he said, drawing loud applause. “Shot!” he added for emphasis.Trump was one of several Republican presidential contenders appearing at the event in this Democratic stronghold. While there's little hope for any of them to defeat President Joe Biden here in a general election, California will play a critical role in the slate of states voting on March 5 in the so-called Super Tuesday primaries.With 169 delegates at stake, a win in California would move a Republican presidential candidate much closer to the nomination. And a recent rule change could give Trump, who is so far dominating the primary, an advantage. If he wins more than 50% of the vote, he would be awarded each of the state's delegates.A Public Policy Institute of California voter survey released Wednesday, but conducted in late August and early September, found Trump with support from nearly half of the likely Republican primary voters. DeSantis was far back, at 14%, with the rest of the field lagging in single digits.Trump's comments on Friday underscored a central question surrounding Trump's effort to return to the presidency. While his focus on red meat issues plays well with the GOP base, it's unclear that it will hold much appeal with the broader set of voters needed to win a general election.His remarks about crime, for instance, were especially pointed. In the past, Trump has proposed shooting migrants to prevent them from crossing the border. In his book and in interviews, former Defense Secretary Mark Esper alleged Trump inquired about shooting protesters during the George Floyd demonstrations. He has also proposed the death penalty for drug dealers, human traffickers and anyone convicted of killing a police officer.During his first year in office, Trump advised police to be rougher in their handling of suspects being apprehended, telling recruits, “please don’t be too nice.”“The word that they shoot you will get out within minutes and our nation, in one day, will be an entirely different place,” Trump said Friday. “There must be retribution for theft and destruction and the ruination of our country.”Homicides and other violent crimes have risen in California, where residents have also been deluged with headlines from rampant car break-ins and drug use in San Francisco’s troubled Tenderloin district to street racing and illegal takeovers across a new $588-million bridge in Los Angeles.Republicans see crime as a salient issue that can help them win back some of the suburban voters who have turned away from the party since Trump emerged as its leader and the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. Several GOP presidential candidates and others in the party have pointed in particular to events this week in Philadelphia, where dozens of people face criminal charges after a night of social media-fueled mayhem in which groups of thieves, apparently working together, smashed their way into stores in several areas of the city.Trump tapped into California Republicans’ exhaustion with their state’s Democratic leaders, who he said brought the state homelessness, open borders, high taxes, inequality, “woke tech tyrants” and rising crime.California was once a symbol of American prosperity and creativity but is “becoming a symbol of our nation’s decline,” Trump said.“We will reverse the decline of America and we will end the desecration of your once great state, California,” Trump said. “This is not a great state anymore. This is a dumping ground. You’re a dumping ground. The world is being dumped into California. Prisoners. Terrorists. Mental patients.”Trump told his supporters “help is on the way,” falsely claimed his 30-point defeats here were the result of fraud and said, improbably, that he would win California in next year’s general election. He railed against using mail ballots on the same day the Republican National Committee launched its “Bank your Vote” initiative in New York, which urges Republicans to vote before Election Day. RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel brushed off Trump’s continued skepticism.“I think we have to take those fights on, but also understand that once it gets to game day, the rules that are on the field are what we need to play by and President Trump is all in on that,” she said.Trump was in California just two days after he bypassed the second GOP debate held at Ronald Reagan’s presidential library northwest of Los Angeles, signaling again that he sees no need to appear side-by-side with lesser-known contenders.Crowds at state party conventions tend to be thick with conservative grassroots activists, an ideal setting for the former president, even as he faces felony charges in four criminal cases.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy were also scheduled to speak at the two-day convention being held at a hotel near Disneyland.Scott said police should get more respect and more money but stopped far short of Trump’s call for violence.“We should respect the police, re-fund the police and thank God Almighty they’re willing to run in when everybody else is running out,” Scott said to a significantly smaller crowd than Trump’s in remarks that appeared to be cut short after the frontrunner’s speech ran late.DeSantis said people are “voting with their feet” and moving in large numbers to Florida in search of freedom from mask and vaccine mandates, low taxes and school choice. He warned that a second Biden term would bring California's policies to the nation.“The California model represents more American decline,"" DeSantis said. ""The Florida model represents a way for us to reverse American decline and represents a way for us to have an American revival, and that’s ultimately the choice that people are going to have to make.”Waiting in line to enter the ballroom for Trump's speech, Dan Cox, a real estate agent from Orange County and registered Republican, was sporting a “Keep America Great” cap and red tie, telegraphing his support for Trump. He lamented rising prices that have put homeownership out of the reach of many families in the state.“I'm voting for someone who can get the job done,” he said, adding that he doesn't trust Biden.Not surprisingly, a smattering of Democrats protested near the convention site.“When the leading candidate of a major political party is under indictment for attempting to overthrow free and fair elections, every voter needs to stop and think about where our country is headed,” San Bernardino County Democratic Party Chair Kristin Washington said in a statement. “The last thing any American needs is to relive that madness.”"

"The crisis of the political system in the US reached a new level of intensity over the past week, with Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s announcement Tuesday of an impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden, the announcement Thursday by a Justice Department special counsel of a criminal indictment against Biden’s son, Hunter, and the growing prospect of a shutdown of the federal government when the current fiscal year ends on September 30. This takes place in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, in which the leading Republican candidate, Donald Trump, is under federal and state criminal indictment for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The presumptive Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, is unpopular, visibly fragile if not senile, and focused on escalating the war against Russia and preparing for military conflict with China, two nuclear powers. This is coupled with mobilizing the trade union apparatus to suppress a growing rebellion by the working class. To pay for the current and looming wars and shore up the world position of the US dollar, the American ruling class must brutally increase its exploitation of the working class, destroy millions more jobs, and gut what remains of basic social programs on which hundreds of millions of workers and young people rely."

"On Tuesday morning, just as the House was returning from its generous late-summer recess, Speaker Kevin McCarthy kicked the fall session off by throwing a bone to conservatives: He was opening an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. This makes it more likely than not—to the extent it was ever unlikely—that House Republicans will impeach Biden, once they can put cobble together the votes and come up with a coherent reason for impeachment. Why was McCarthy doing this? It’s unlikely that he earnestly believes Joe Biden must be removed from office for high crimes and misdemeanors. No, he was throwing a bone to the far right of his conference, who have been stubbornly threatening to vote against funding the government at the end of the month unless an unreasonable wish list is met. As one Senate Republican put it to the Hill, this was McCarthy “giving people their binkie” ahead of the spending deadline. But this is not the binkie the hard-liners were looking for."

"RK By the early 1970s, we were in a bind, because after the collapse of the underground, we had hundreds of young African recruits who had been trained — initially in Algeria or Egypt or even Ethiopia, then some to China, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, and particularly the Soviet Union — and come back to our camps in Tanzania. We were three thousand kilometres from South Africa, and to get through Portuguese Mozambique, to get through Ian Smith’s Rhodesia, to get home that way was very difficult and went very slowly. So there was a building-up of impatience in our group. We tried, first of all, to send a ‘flying column’ through Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia). The ZAPU people were going to try and establish secret bases in the country, the ANC people were going to try and slip through to cross over the border, and then to go into various parts of South Africa and establish clandestine guerilla groups. But the white supremacists were very resourceful: they had spies everywhere, even in villages, and people who collaborated. So these groups were spotted and there were firefights, so they didn’t get through to South Africa; they had to retreat, or some of them were arrested and spent the next 20 years in Ian Smith’s prisons."
"A Manitoba cabinet minister defeated in Tuesday’s provincial election says the Progressive Conservative party she has served for years took a hard-right pivot during the election campaign and now needs to address an identity crisis. Rochelle Squires, who served in a variety of cabinet posts since the Tories took power in 2016, said she was surprised by campaign ads that touted the government’s opposition to a landfill search for the remains of Indigenous women. “It certainly was a surprise and certainly was something that was not reflective of the work that we had been doing in government for the last 7 1/2 years, and it’s deeply regrettable,” Squires said in an interview Wednesday."
""""""" The group said that the meeting should be 'held as soon as possible . ' OTTAWA ( LifeSiteNews ) — Six Canadian MPs are demanding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ’ s Liberal government publicly meet to discuss reports alleging that the Chinese Communist regime had been funding candidates in the 2019 federal election . “ A recent troubling media report revealed that Canadian intelligence officials informed the Prime Minister and several cabinet ministers in January of this year that the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) actively worked to influence the 2019 Federal Election , ” wrote the MPs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Procedure and House Affairs Committee ( PROC ) chair , Bardish Chagger , last Wednesday . “ Further , former CSIS ( Canadian Security Intelligence Service ) agents have criticized the government ’ s failure to take serious action to address or prosecute this foreign state interference in our democratic process , ” added the group of MPs . The letter was signed by Conservative Party of Canada MPs Luc Berthold , John Nater , Michael Cooper , and Blaine Calkins , as well as Bloc Québécois MP and committee vice-chair Marie-Hélène Gaudreau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MP Rachel Blaney . All the MPs who signed the letter are members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs . The group ’ s letter is in direct response to a recent Global News article , which LifeSiteNews reported on , which stated that CSIS has identified at least 11 candidates in the 2019 federal election who were thought to be under the direct funding and influence of the CCP . The MPs wrote that given the news reports about CCP interference , they are “ writing to you pursuant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to request that the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs meet in public to determine how the Committee should respond to this troubling revelation. ” The group said that the meeting should be “ held as soon as possible. ” House of Commons procedure states that committee members are allowed to in effect force a committee to meet publicly if at least four MPs from no less than two parties demand it . Conservative MP Copper on Twitter last week wrote alongside a copy of the letter demanding the meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a plan to counter Beijing ’ s foreign interference ops on Canadian soil. ” According to the Global News report , Trudeau and some of his ministers had been given information in January of this year regarding this alleged covert funding , with the report adding that sources claimed Beijing ’ s efforts were done with the specific intention of subverting Canada ’ s democratic process . The report also noted by way of information from CSIS that payments were made through middlemen to candidates with close ties to the CCP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the CCP having agents working in the offices of MPs , which was done to try and influence policy direction . While the names of the 2019 candidates were not identified , the alleged interference reportedly included members of both the Liberal and Conservative parties .

In July of this year , LifeSiteNews also reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research unit showed that the CCP may have tried to influence the outcome of the Canadian 2021 federal election as well . Shortly after the 2021 election – Trudeau won both the 2019 and 2021 elections – Conservative Senator Leo Housakos introduced Senate Bill S-237 , formally titled “ An Act To Establish The Foreign Influence Registry and to amend the Criminal Code. ” If passed , this law – currently in its second reading – would make it so all federal lobbyists who receive funds from a “ foreign government , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government ” must disclose any payments as well as names of clients . Failure to comply would result in a $ 200,000 fine along with a two-year jail term . Chinese influence in Canadian politics is unsurprising for many , especially given Trudeau ’ s past admiration for China ’ s “ basic dictatorship ” and his government ’ s unwillingness to declare the CCP ’ s treatment of its Uyghur population a “ genocide , ” despite credible evidence . Moreover , top-secret military documents revealed in 2020 show that under Trudeau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s Liberation Army ( PLA ) had been invited to train in Canada at a military base in Ontario . """""""
""""""" Recently Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of the Archdiocese of San Francisco announced that Nancy Pelosi would be denied Holy Communion due to her pro-abortion stance until she goes to confession and receives absolution . It is unclear if other Archdioceses will follow suit .

Meanwhile , one should not forget Joe Biden ’ s claim that the Pope told him that he could receive communion despite his pro-abortion stance . The Vatican did not verify whether this was the case .

This situation reminds me of the confrontation between Pope Gregory VII and Henry IV of the Holy Roman Empire in the Eleventh Century over the issue of lay investiture ( clergymen being appointed by secular authorities ) and monarchs having jurisdiction over the clergy .

Associate Justice Clarence Thomas warned that the leak ( s ) could mark the end of the high court ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Parkland Conference in Dallas where he was Friday ’ s keynote speaker . The conference describes itself as a place “ to discuss alternative proven approaches to tackling the challenges facing Black Americans today , ” An appointee of President George H.W . Bush and one of the court ’ s staunchest conservatives , Justice Thomas suggested that the unprecedented public release of the draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade has prompted the justices and their aides to look at each other with suspicion . “ When you lose that trust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m in , it changes the institution fundamentally . You begin to look over your shoulder , ” Thomas said . “ It ’ s kind of like infidelity that you can explain it , but you can ’ t undo it. ” Thomas said that before the release of the draft opinion , made public by Politico last week , he considered that sort of disclosure unthinkable . “ If someone said that one line of one opinion would be leaked by anyone … you would say : ‘ That ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , ’ ” the justice said . “ That was verboten . It was beyond anyone ’ s understanding or at least anyone ’ s imagination. ” “ I wonder how long we ’ re going to have these institutions at the rate we ’ re undermining them , and then I wonder when they ’ re gone or destabilized what we will have as a country and I don ’ t think the prospects are good if we continue to lose them , ” warned the conservative justice . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the draft opinion , White House Press secretary Jen Psaki encouraged the Democrat base to intimidate the justices into upholding Roe v. Wade by protesting at their homes . Conservatives never resort to employing those intimidation tactics , Justice Thomas argued . “ You would never visit Supreme Court justice ’ s houses when things didn ’ t go our way . We didn ’ t throw temper tantrums . I think it is…incumbent on us to always act appropriately and not to repay tit for tat , ” he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Q & A session .

"Several people were arrested after entering the office of Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the House, during a protest for HIV/Aids funding on Monday. The US President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), a widely bipartisan program, has since been reauthorized three times, and Joe Biden earlier this year indicated that he would work with Congress to extend it a fourth. But the program’s latest extension has been caught up in a partisan fight over abortion and is under threat amid Congress’s negotiations over a government shutdown. Some Republicans are opposing Pepfar’s reauthorization, arguing that current restrictions do not sufficiently prevent the funds from being used to support abortions, according to an August report by the Federation of American Scientists."

Local communities and other nations in the Pacific Ocean fear the dumping will poison the environment and cripple local fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover from the March 2011 nuclear accident on Japan ’ s northeast coast for over a decade . According to a government plan released on December 28 , 2021 , Tokyo Electric Power Company ( TEPCO ) will start releasing 1 million metric tonnes of radioactive water from the Fukushima plant into the Pacific Ocean in 2023 . The plan , which is still being developed over the coming months , states that an undersea tunnel will be built to pump the water out to the sea . Funds have also been reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for potential “ reputational damage. ” In March 2011 an earthquake and tsunami caused three nuclear reactors operated by TEPCO in Fukushima to meltdown . Over the years , groundwater flowing through the plants was contaminated with radioactive content . In order to prevent this water from reaching the ocean , it was pumped from the reactor buildings into large tanks that now dominate the reactor installation . A Screenshot from the YouTube video of the Manhattan Project for a Nuclear-Free World featuring Japanese mothers from the townships of Okuma and Futaba protesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific Ocean . As of December 2021 , at least 1 million tonnes of contaminated water are stored in the tanks inside the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station . While highly radioactive contaminants are removed , the stored water that the Japanese government is planning to pump out to sea still contains significant amounts of tritium , a radioactive element that some experts say is harmless when diluted in seawater . The Japanese government ’ s plan to pump the contaminated water has been in the works since 2020 . Greenpeace said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signatures opposing the plan to discharge water from the Fukushima plant . Also in April 2021 , South Korean civil society groups issued a statement condemning TEPCO ’ s plan , noting , “ even if diluted the total amount of radioactive material thrown into the sea remains unchanged . If the radioactive wastewater is discharged , it will be an irrevocable disaster not only for marine ecosystem but for the human. ” The issue was tackled during the Pacific Islands Forum Foreign Ministers Meeting in July 2021 , and the body made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted the concerns surrounding the seriousness of this issue in relation to the potential threat of further nuclear contamination of our Blue Pacific and the potential adverse and transboundary impacts to the health and security of the Blue Pacific Continent , and its peoples over both the short and long term .

TEPCO assured the public that it is continually updating its scientific studies regarding the plan to release processed water into the Pacific .

The Pacific Collective on Nuclear Issues , which represents civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veracity of these studies . It also has a message for TEPCO and the Japanese government : The Pacific is not and must not become the dumping ground for nuclear wastes . The Collective considers that TEPCO , and the relevant Japanese Government agencies , have wrongly prioritised convenience and costs over the short term and long term environmental and human cost of their planned actions . Japanese residents have also consistently expressed concern about TEPCO ’ s plan . Greenpeace interviewed fisherman Ono Haruo from the township of Shinchi in Fukushima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local population : Fish are finally starting to return after ten years , but if they now pour tritium into the water , no matter how much they dilute it , who ’ s going to buy those fish ?

A boon for the GOP, the results will have stark consequences for state policy, easing the way for new legislation that would target LGBTQ+ residents, and empowering politicians who have championed draconian anti-crime measures and attacks on public education. They will likely set up more clashes between the conservative state government and the city of New Orleans. The results also signaled that election conspiracies continue to resonate with the GOP base, as several campaigns emerged triumphant after fueling false allegations of fraud during a critical juncture for the state’s voting systems.

""""""" BUCHAREST , Romania ( AP ) — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg reaffirmed the military alliance 's commitment to Ukraine on Tuesday , saying that the war-torn nation will one day become a member of the world 's largest security organization . Stoltenberg 's remarks came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his NATO counterparts gathered in Romania to drum up urgently needed support for Ukraine aimed at ensuring that Moscow fails to defeat the country as it bombards energy infrastructure . “ NATO ’ s door is open , ” Stoltenberg said . “ Russia does not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in reference to the recent entry of North Macedonia and Montenegro into the security alliance . He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin “ will get Finland and Sweden as NATO members ” soon .

In essence , Stoltenberg repeated a vow made by NATO leaders in Bucharest in 2008 — in the same sprawling Palace of the Parliament where the foreign ministers are meeting this week — that Ukraine , and also Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some officials and analysts believe this move — pressed on the NATO allies by former U.S. President George W. Bush — was partly responsible for the war that Russia launched on Ukraine in February . Stoltenberg disagreed . “ President Putin can not deny sovereign nations to make their own sovereign decisions that are not a threat to Russia , ” he said . “ I think what he ’ s afraid of is democracy and freedom , and that ’ s the main challenge for him. ” Even so , Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the Crimean Peninsula annexed , and Russian troops and pro-Moscow separatists holding parts of the south and east , it ’ s not clear what Ukraine ’ s borders would even look like .

During the two-day meeting , Blinken will announce substantial U.S. aid for Ukraine ’ s energy grid , U.S. officials said . Ukraine ’ s network has been battered countrywide since early October by targeted Russian strikes , in what U.S. officials call a Russian campaign to weaponize the coming winter cold . “ We are all paying a price for Russia ’ s war against Ukraine . But the price we pay is in money , '' Stoltenberg said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay is a price paid in blood. ” The meeting in Romania — which shares NATO 's longest land border with Ukraine — is likely to see NATO make fresh pledges of nonlethal support to Ukraine : fuel , generators , medical supplies , winter equipment and drone-jamming devices . Individual allies are also likely to announce fresh supplies of military equipment for Ukraine — chiefly the air defense systems that Kyiv so desperately seeks to protect its skies — but NATO , as an organization , will not , to avoid being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia .

"Midway through the Q.-&-A. section of Nikki Haley’s town hall, earlier this month, at the Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Merrimack, New Hampshire, a man named Ted Johnson stood up to announce that America was heading for civil war. “So,” he asked Haley, “how can I get back to that day, in the nineteen-eighties, when I was happy, running in the street, riding my bike?” As it happens, Haley brings up the eighties a lot. Her most recent book takes its title from a Margaret Thatcher quotation, and she frequently invokes Thatcher on the campaign trail; last month, at the first G.O.P. Presidential debate, she trotted out the “If you want something done, ask a woman” line to her biggest audience yet. In February, a video teaser for Haley’s campaign had opened with a grainy clip of Jeane Kirkpatrick—the Democrat turned neocon foreign-policy adviser to Ronald Reagan—addressing the 1984 Republican National Convention. In the course of the very long U.S. Presidential-campaign season, most candidates are usually furnished with an opportunity to have “a moment.” This is Nikki Haley’s: CNN’s most recent general-election trial heats show her beating Joe Biden by the biggest margin of any Republican candidate, including Donald Trump. After the first debate, which, as the Washington Post put it, Haley “won on brains and experience,” David Brooks wrote that it was time to “give Haley her chance”; even The New Republic had a piece about why she “scares the Biden campaign.” Haley doesn’t present as an isolationist or a populist; she doesn’t call the government “the regime” or compare the country to the Roman Empire in decline; at her events that I attended, she never said the word “woke,” or even “liberal” or “élites.” She favors the cliché “I’ve always spoken in hard truths,” a simple bromide that manages to distinguish her in the non-Trump G.O.P. primary lineup—not haranguing like Ron DeSantis or Vivek Ramaswamy, not as lifeless as Mike Pence’s comparable appeal to the golden age."

East Asia had the opportunity of witnessing the diplomacy of one of the most seasoned diplomats of the United States — Joe Biden , President of the U.S . He spent five days in Korea and Japan from May 20 to May 24 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomacy which did not seek only the interests of the U.S. ; The world was hoping to see a diplomacy which promoted also the interests of the partner countries , especially , Japan and Korea . However , to the great disappointment of many , Biden was repeating Washington ’ s old foreign policy determined by the warmongering CIA , the National Security Council and the Department of State . As a matter of fact , Biden came to East Asia with the chilly wind of war and for the recruitment of soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper discusses two outcomes of Biden ’ s East Asia visit , namely , intensification of regional security risks and the recruitment of countries which will be asked to conduct proxy war against China . The regional security risk had increased due to the following decisions of Biden : the North Korea Policy , the trilateral military alliance of Japan-ROK-US and Biden ’ s declaration of American military intervention in a possible Taiwan-China war . Biden ’ s North Korea policy offered nothing new . Instead , he has made two commitments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it may bring even possible armed conflict . First , he accepted the request of the new conservative government of Yoon Suk-yeul to beef up the striking power of the ROK army by promising the deployment of strategic military assets such as , for instance , the strategic nuclear weapon . “ If Kim Jung-un denuclearizes North Korea , the U.S. might engage with Pyongyang for peace ! ” What he was really saying is this : “ We have no intention of establishing peace on the Korea Peninsula. ” These two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea which had been quite annoyed by Yoon ’ s previous declaration of his intention of pre-emptive attack against North Korea . Now , the Japan-Korea-US trilateral military alliance ( JKUS military alliance ) in practice means a de facto Japan-Korea military alliance . The military relation between Korea and the U.S. is more than a military alliance , because Washington can command the ROK army in case of war . In fact , South Korea is a part of American armed forces as long as Washington has the OPCON ( the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces in war involving South Korea ) . What is worrisome regarding the Japan-Korea military alliance is the possibility of the presence of the Japanese military on Korean soil . For Koreans , such a possibility is a nightmare , because they know that Japan ’ s ambition of ruling Asia again — especially Korea — is still alive . In particular for North Koreans , this military alliance could lead to a possible participation of the Japanese Armed Forces in an attack against North Korea . North Korea is already reacting violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including 4 missiles simultaneously to show that it can hit several targets at the same time . These missiles are short-range or medium-range missiles threatening South Korea and Japan . There is no doubt that the election of Yoon as president representing the anti-North Korean pro-Japan South Korean conservatives combined with the warmongering Washington establishment and the Japanese ambition to restore the glory of the Meiji Era are enough to threaten North Korea . Under such circumstances , North Korea might decide to join the Russia-China bloc in a global “ East-West shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more ; South Korea will meet its death . Yoon will remain the worst traitor to the Korean Nation . What is even more terrifying is Biden ’ s declaration of military intervention in the event of Taiwan-China war . This is surely an intervention into China ’ s internal affairs . The world knows that the U.S. has recognized the One-China policy by virtue of the three joint statements ( 1972 , 1979 and 1982 ) and the Taiwan Relation Act ( 1979 ) . In fact , Biden admitted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , Washington has been violating the One-China principle for decades through the policies of the American Institute in Taiwan ( AIT ) . In accordance with the 1982 Agreement with China ( the 6 Assurances of Donald Reagan ) , Washington can provide only “ defensive weapons ” to Taiwan . But I wonder if there is such thing as defensive weapon . For decades , Washington has been pouring billions of dollars worth of weapons . Trump gave Taiwan 4 billion USD every year . Can we believe that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In a way , the contradictory Taiwan policy of Washington is understandable for Taiwan is in fact the American fixed aircraft carrier threatening China at its front door . It is said that if U.S. loses Taiwan , its regional interests in East Asia will be seriously damaged . This is the worst kind of imperialist attitude . How can a country claim its interest by arming a foreign sovereign country ? But , for China , a Taiwan armed to the teeth by the US is an intolerable threat . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with China . By inciting China ’ s PLA to invade Taiwan , Washington is intent upon breaking one of the conditions which could justify such an invasion . There are five conditions which would allow Beijing to intervene in Taiwan : • Taiwan ’ s acquisition of weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) such as strategic nuclear weapon and • Violation of the Taipei-Beijing Consensus for 1992 One-China principle . Washington can ask Japan to provoke a situation in which one of these conditions can be broken even without the declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is to send a WMD to Taiwan such as a strategic nuclear weapon or organize internal turmoil within Taiwan or form a Japan-Taiwan military alliance . Japan will be happy to accommodate such a request by Washington because it is the dream of the Neo-Meiji Restoration Group ( NMRG ) led by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to beat China with Washington ’ s help and become once again the ruler of Asia , if not the world . Thus , to be sure , Biden was successful in making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia . The Japan-Korea bilateral military alliance is intended to recruit proxy-war soldiers . As pointed above , if Washington decides to attack North Korea , the ROK army and the Japanese army are likely to fight for the hegemony of Washington and for Japan ’ s re-conquest of Korea . What is more important for Biden is the recruitment of soldiers to fight against Chinese forces in US sponsored Taiwan-China war . The same ROK soldiers and the Japanese soldiers are expected to do the shooting on behalf of Washington . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shooting match ; it will just provide more weapons as it is doing in the Ukraine-Russia war . One puzzling aspect of this dangerous security dynamics of East Asia initiated by Washington is the “ harakiri ” — security strategy of the pro-Japan conservative South Korean government led by Yoon . South Korea ’ s participation in the attack against North Korea will bring nothing positive . In fact , millions of South Koreans may lose their lives and its economy will be ruined . Furthermore , the participation of the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could end up with a permanent presence of the Japanese military on Korean soil and even the 1910 treacherous drama of annexation of Korea with Japan may repeat itself . It is likely that the pro-Japan conservative Koreans will support it like their ancestors did in 1910 . This may sound absurd . But do not forget one thing . The core of the pro-Japan South Koreans is composed of the descendents of former Korean elite who collaborated with the Japanese colonial government and those Japanese who did not return to Japan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide their identity . To be frank , this group is more Japanese than Korean . Moreover , the participation of the South Korean army in the Taiwan-China war would create a situation in which South Korea will have to endure China ’ s trade reprisal and even direct military bombardment on Korean soil . About a quarter of South Korean exports go to China . A simple deployment few years ago of THAAD near Seoul made South Korean pay a heavy price in terms of loss of income from tourism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” in China , the forced closing of Korean companies in China and other forms of retaliation . The U.S. can not and will not compensate for such a huge loss . For Korea , the only wise way of surviving in the Sino-American hegemonic confrontation is to be neutral and maintain friendly relations with both the U.S. and China . This is what Moon Jae-in did . Alas , Yoon blew away what Moon has accomplished . This is tragic , indeed . The liberal government of Moon Jae-in was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Korea , being the 10th global economic power and the 6th military power , could bargain to Korea ’ s advantage with Beijing and Washington . Now , as for Japan , the Japanese imperialist conservatives led by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are more than happy to be legionnaires in the Taiwan-China war . For Abe and his friends , the Taiwan-China war can be a God-given gift . Remember that the Abe group has the dream of restoring the might and glory of pre-1945 Japan . This group denies Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not accept the Tokyo War Criminal Court . It has the illusion of being the predestined ruler of the world . To realize its dream , Japan has to destroy China . To destroy China , Japan needs a regular army , not just the so-called self-defence army . To do this , Japan has to modify the 1948 Peace Constitution , especially the controversial Article 9 . However , the materialization of Abe ’ s dream needs Biden ’ s support . Biden is aware of the danger that Japanese have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans do remember the massacre of Pearl Harbor . It is more than possible that Biden does not want see Japan too powerful . But to “ Kill China ” , Biden Needs Military Japan Biden ’ s declaration of military intervention in the Taiwan-China war was intended to recruit the Japanese army as proxy army fighting for the U.S . The same goes for the ROK army . For Biden , the Japanese army is the best legionnaire to fight against China . To force China to attack the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to war . In fact , Japan is good at it . The Mukden incidence in Manchuria in 1931 leading to Japanese invasion in Manchuria and the Marco Polo Bridge incidence provoking an all-out war with China in 1937 started because of faked incidences prepared by the Japanese army . In short , Biden did well in recruiting the armed forces of the two major military powers in the region as legionnaires in the case of a possible Taiwan-China proxy war . In addition to the recruitment of the two military powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in producing another China containment organization comprising of 13 countries through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework ( IPEF ) . This is composed of 7 ASEAN member countries ( Singapore , Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand the Philippines , Vietnam , Brunei ) and the U.S. , India , Japan , ROK , Australia , New Zealand . The purpose of this new organization is to contain China . The IPEF gives itself four areas of regional cooperation including realignment of the production chain , renewable energy , trade and fight against corruption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain China intensified by the restriction of exchanges of goods , ideas and services especially exchange of technology . Most of the experts in Korean trade and international politics argue that this could bring disaster to Korea due to possible retaliation on the part of China . Japan looks very excited to be a part of IPEF for it will provide opportunities to play a leadership role with help of the ROK as a cheer leader . The assurance of investments of USD 27 billion in the U.S. by Samsung and Hyundai is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these investments will strengthen America ’ s competitiveness in electric cars and semi-conductors . They will be a part of US ’ China containment policy China . The Indo-Pacific Economic Forum ( IPEF ) is , in fact , an additional China containment policy in order to strengthen the effectiveness of anti-China strategies . Up to now , the previous strategies have not been effective . Since the time of Obama , Washington has been trying to contain China through several strategies , but none of them has yielded expected results . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in the South China Sea led to the militarization of the Chinese reefs . The TPP went nowhere , because it had two contradictory objectives , namely trade promotion and China containment . If the objective was regional trade promotion , China should be included . If the objective is China containment , China will retaliate and the member countries ’ trade with China will fall . The ensuing loss of trade with China could be greater than the gain of trade with its TPP member countries . So , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington compensates the deficit . The question is : “ Can Washington afford it ? ” No wonder why Trump decided to withdraw from it . TPP has now become CPTPP also known as TPP-11 ( The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership of eleven countries including Australia , Brunei , Canada , Chile , Japan , Malaysia , Mexico , New Zealand , Peru , Singapore and Vietnam ) , which seems to be more than trade . But , to the extent that Japan leads it , it could become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the ambition of ruling Asia . The effectiveness of AUKUS as a military alliance remains to be proven . The new Prime Minister of Australia may have different ideas about Australia-China relations . The new Foreign Minister of Australia , Penny Wong , is known to be pro-China and her boss Anthony Albanese , the new Prime Minister of Australia , proposed a softer approach to China policy . The effectiveness of Quad depends on how India would react in case of war with China . India belongs to several multinational organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where India maintains good relations with China . India PM Narendra Modi , US president Joe Biden , Japanese PM Fumio Kishida , Australian PM Anthony Albanese , Quad summit in Tokyo on May 24 . India is not sure of Washington ’ s security guarantee in the long run . India is disappointed of being excluded from AUKUS . India is fearful of Chinese retaliation . For all these reasons , India ’ s membership in Quad does not seem to be as strong as that of Japan . The IPEF is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This replaces the TPP and it is supposed to be trade-oriented with the hidden objective of destroying China . Therefore , it has the same dilemma as TPP . Whether its objective is for trade or China containment , the probability of success is low . Remember that all the member countries depend heavily on China for trade and investment . However , the most serious stumbling block to the U.S. global hegemony are the worsening internal problems within the United States . The inflation which could become galloping , intensifying street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people suffering from hunger , crowed city streets by the homeless and the jobless , soaring medical care cost preventing millions of people from getting medical care and rising number of school kids who starve due to ugly income inequality are all the sign of declining Pax Americana . It appears that the priority should be given to the solution of the internal problems . Some people may say that Biden , the great expert of diplomacy , has harvested rich rewards from his Asian tour .

"Some in the GOP chalk it up to Gaetz seeking a future foothold as a conservative TV pundit, others to a desire for name recognition ahead of his widely expected gubernatorial bid in 2026. Still others say he’s sincere in his demands for more spending cuts before voting to fund the government. The speaker hasn’t publicly weighed in. But in private, McCarthy has questioned what he could have done to trigger this level of hostility from Gaetz, according to a longtime ally of the speaker. Other McCarthy allies have theorized that Gaetz’s fury dates back to a now-closed Justice Department inquiry into sex trafficking allegations, when some in the House GOP came just short of openly celebrating his potential political demise. Gaetz said in a brief interview that he doesn’t fault McCarthy for anything related to that probe: “No, I think that was all handled fine.” And he denied he’s running for governor, saying in a statement to POLITICO: “I am singularly focused on my current job in Congress. I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be, doing exactly what I’m supposed to be doing. I am not making plans to run for governor or any other office.”"

"“The future of The Left is a future without Sahra Wagenknecht.” Despite the rapid rise of the Right-wing party AfD in Germany, which secured 18% of the vote in this weekend’s Hessian election, the Leftist party Die Linke wants nothing to do with one of Germany’s most popular politicians. While roughly 20% of Germans would consider supporting a party with Wagenknecht in charge, the leaders of her current party, Die Linke, have demanded that she resign her seat in the Bundestag, the German parliament. Admittedly, Wagenknecht hasn’t gone out of her way to make friends. In her 2021 book Die Selbstgerechten (The Self-Righteous), she condemned the rise of a so-called “lifestyle Left” that was made up of “the academic middle class, software programmers, and marketing experts” whose obsessions with political correctness, climate change, and unregulated immigration threatened to alienate Die Linke’s supporters in the working class and among the unemployed. The attack was taken badly by her comrades, who saw the book as a declaration of “literal war against her own party” and “the marginalised”. Like what you’re reading?

"Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., briefs reporters following a closed-door Republican Conference meeting on how to agree on a path to funding the government, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2023. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) President Joe Biden’s 81st birthday isn’t for two months. But House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the country’s leading Republican, has already sent his gift — an impeachment inquiry that’s likely to backfire and resuscitate Biden’s catatonic re-election campaign. If Biden gets a boost, it’ll come not a moment too soon for Democratic leaders, who fall into one of two camps: There are those in denial about Biden’s advanced age, low approval ratings and diminished capacity, and then there are those who accept those harsh realities but are scared to express their concerns out loud, because they don’t want to offend the White House or do anything that helps Republicans. Half the Democrats aren’t honest; the other half aren’t brave."

"At expensive resorts and closed-door conferences, Democratic donors are urging their friends not to fund potential spoiler candidates. And in key swing states, lone-wolf operators, including a librarian from Arizona, are trying their own tactics to make life difficult for third-party contenders. The anxiety over candidates and parties traditionally consigned to the fringes of American politics reflects voters’ deep dissatisfaction with both men who are likely to become the major parties’ nominees. No third-party candidate has risen out of the single digits in three decades, since Ross Perot captured nearly a fifth of the vote in 1992. Given the devotion of Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters, Democrats fear that most of the attrition would come from Mr. Biden’s fragile coalition. “They’ve got to understand the risk that they are exposing the country to by doing this,” said Richard A. Gephardt, a former House majority leader and a Democratic Party graybeard who has formed a super PAC to attack outsider campaigns. “This is too dangerous of an idea to put in play in this context, in this year. These are not normal times.”"

"On Nov. 7, Greater Pittsburgh, like the rest of the country, will head to the polls. The region’s patchwork of small municipalities, school districts and magisterial courts means that residents living blocks apart may have very different ballots. Some of these races may not seem glamorous, but candidates and elected officials agree that voting in these local contests has a major bearing on local policy. Allegheny County Councilor Tom Duerr, who serves on the county board of elections and has worked on several Democratic campaigns, encourages locals to pay attention to these races. “I see firsthand the impact that this local of an office can have,” Duerr said. Municipal elected officials “will have far more impact on your everyday life than any position in Harrisburg or D.C.” Not only do politicians at the local level address needs including trash collection, public transport and infrastructure upkeep, Duerr said, but they’re much more accessible than state and national figures."
"What do you get when you combine a tiny legislative majority, a former president itching for influence and a rogue group of lawmakers who like making headlines? House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s hellish life these days. The pressure has been fierce on McCarthy to fashion an agreement with his caucus to stave off a government shutdown. But every day seems to bring another set of demands from hardline House Freedom Caucus members, who seem unwilling to accept a deal – and willing to risk a shutdown to make their points. The Conversation spoke with congressional expert Charles R. Hunt, a political scientist at Boise State University, about the current political standoff, its roots and what it means for people across the country. Why does a small faction of GOP lawmakers have control over McCarthy? The 2022 elections were much closer than Republicans thought they were going to be. And there is a big difference between having a 20-vote margin and the nine-vote margin that McCarthy has now. A big part of the speaker’s job is to whip votes and to keep people in line, mainly in the speaker’s own party. And that becomes much more difficult when you have such a small margin."

""""""" House Republicans are calling for a congressional investigation into the FBI ’ s raid on and seizure of information from Project Veritas ’ James O ’ Keefe and potentially other government actions against a free press . “ I have called for a specific investigation into how some of those tools were used against Project Veritas , ” Rep. Matt Gaetz , R-Fla. , told The Daily Signal in a brief interview after a House GOP forum on press freedom . Project Veritas is a conservative nonprofit investigative journalism website known for its undercover video exposes . “ So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific than just a general review of the law and subject area . I want to see if , in this particular case , the standards that the Department [ of Justice ] sets and that are set in law may have been violated , ” Gaetz said . The FBI raided O ’ Keefe ’ s home and the office of Project Veritas in November seeking information about the allegedly stolen diary of Ashley Biden , the daughter of President Joe Biden , that a source had given to him . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diary , O ’ Keefe brought it to police and did not have possession of it when federal authorities raided his home . O ’ Keefe told members of Congress at the forum about how FBI agents took a battering ram to the door of his home and handcuffed him . “ Our objective here is to vindicate a free press , ” Gaetz said . “ I don ’ t think the specific substance of Ashley Biden ’ s diary is as important as these broader principles that seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” During the forum , the Florida Republican told the witnesses testifying at the hearing and fellow members of Congress , “ As we prepare for our time in the majority , it is not enough to pass laws and believe those laws will have their own fiat. ” “ It has to be done on the front end , and then there has to be rigorous and aggressive oversight on the back end . Based on my review of the facts in Mr. O ’ Keefe ’ s case , we ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the majority , not just of this policy area , but of this particular circumstance regarding Project Veritas , because it unlocks so many things , ” he said . Rep. Andy Biggs , R-Ariz. , who chaired the hearing-style forum held at the FreedomWorks headquarters in Washington , concurred with Gaetz about the need for a congressional investigation . “ One thing that should frighten every American is when the freedom of the press is threatened by the weaponization of the state police apparatus , ” Biggs told The Daily Signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on testimony from O ’ Keefe and Sharyl Attkisson , host of the TV newsmagazine program Full Measure and a former CBS News reporter . “ Neither side of the partisan aisle should tolerate any kind of aggressive attempt to silence or censor speech , and particularly of a free press , ” Biggs said . While the mainstream media frequently reacted to former President Donald Trump ’ s verbal attacks on certain journalists and news outlets , Biggs said that ’ s not comparable to turning law enforcement against unfavored media outlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden administration and previously in the Obama presidency . “ On one hand , you have a president actually exercising his First Amendment speech being critical of the Fourth Estate , ” Biggs told The Daily Signal . “ On the other hand , you had administrations weaponizing and using the police apparatus to go against people that they wanted to stifle . I think that ’ s a huge difference. ” The event was not a formal House hearing or associated with a committee . It ’ s a common practice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minority to hold hearing-style forums with witnesses taking questions from members of Congress . The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the liberal American Civil Liberties Union both objected to the raid and the secret warrants that preceded it . For that reason , O ’ Keefe said , there should be bipartisan support to ensure that what happened to him won ’ t happen to other journalists . O ’ Keefe urged lawmakers to enact requirements that , before subpoenas , warrants , or orders seeking to seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first give notice , provide a hearing to the journalist , and place the burden of proof on the government to provide clear and convincing evidence for the need to seize information . He also called for Congress to codify the right of any journalist to challenge any subpoenas , warrants , or orders to seize information . O ’ Keefe said he also would like to see a congressional investigation , and “ If I ’ m wrong , and there isn ’ t bipartisanship on this issue , then we ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Merrick Garland has stated the burden of proof should be higher in obtaining information from a news outlet . “ What is their answer to the question on why they didn ’ t follow the law and the procedures outlined by the attorney general , United States , and all ? It ’ s as simple as that , ” O ’ Keefe told The Daily Signal . “ Now , we need to make sure that the legislative branch of government prevents this from ever happening to anybody else. ” “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to have the clear and convincing standard prior to the execution of the search warrant , ” O ’ Keefe continued . “ In other words , you have to see what the allegation is , because it ’ s circular reasoning to say that we need to see your source material for you to prove that you didn ’ t do anything wrong. ” O ’ Keefe noted that Josh Gerstein — one of the Politico reporters who broke the story about the leaking of a draft Supreme Court opinion reversing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly isn ’ t facing any legal consequences . But he noted the irony that his trouble came after opting against publishing any content from the diary he obtained . “ Gerstein publishes the Roe v. Wade opinion , and it ’ s right that he sleeps in his bed comfortably at 5:30 in the morning , not being woken up by federal agents . I don ’ t think he should be , ” O ’ Keefe told The Daily Signal . “ It ’ s ironic that in this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We attempted to corroborate the allegations in the document . Yes , we endeavored to do that . And they ’ re punishing us for attempting to . They ’ re punishing us for calling the Biden campaign for comment. ” Rep. Michael Cloud , R-Texas , noted at the hearing that in some cases , government bureaucrats might realize they can ’ t ultimately win the case against journalists , but use their power as a chilling effect on reporting . “ The process is the punishment , in the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole process and proving your innocence , but the process ends up being the punishment , ” Cloud said . Attkisson has been in litigation after first learning in 2011 that the Justice Department had spied on her during the Obama administration . She said the conduct is part of a long-standing culture at the FBI and intelligence agencies . “ Our intelligence agencies , including the FBI , are made up of public servants paid with public money . They operate largely in the dark , ” Attkisson told the panel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know do a great job . Unfortunately , even the little evidence that has become public reveals disturbing facts . There are agents and officials who are capable of great abuses , and it ’ s not rare . “ Too often , the whistleblowers in these cases — when we find out about them — get punished , while the abusers and criminals get a pass . The implicit message is lost on no one , ” she added . She noted the CIA , the National Security Agency , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later journalists , including reporters from Fox News and The Associated Press . “ They secretly intruded upon and monitored my computers and devices and those of my family while I worked at CBS News , ” Attkisson told the members of Congress . She later added , “ After CBS News officially announced the spy operation against me , I attended an investigative journalism conference where one executive from each major network pulled me aside and told me they felt certain the government was surveilling them , too . Imagine how this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosses allow us to report. ” This is part of a bigger censorship push , said Biggs , the Arizona congressman . He said there is also a significant problem with politicians pushing Big Tech companies to censor content . “ One of our biggest threats to our society is the marriage of Big Government to Big Business and particularly Big Tech business , ” Biggs said . “ And if that ’ s happening , that really becomes something that should be treated as fascism . ” """""""

Austin , who noted that he is also a veteran of the war , said he witnessed “ firsthand the bravery , selflessness , and compassion that our men and women brought to the fight. ” The Pentagon chief concluded his letter by addressing those who have “ hard questions ” about the war and what their sacrifices in Afghanistan meant . “ Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war has ended , our gratitude to those who served never will . Today , I renew that pledge , ” he continued . “ To every man and woman who served in Afghanistan : This country will never forget what you did and what you gave. ” Scott Mann , a retired Green Beret , followed a strict code during his three combat tours in Afghanistan . “ We were taught in special operations , for example , that everything we do is by , with and through the indigenous populations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told The Hill . “ You do not abandon them , you do not leave them .

On October 5 , OPEC+ , an alliance between the longstanding Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) cartel and ten other oil exporters led by Russia , announced a production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( bpd ) , as of November . The cut was approximately double the 1 million BPD that global oil market experts said they expected . Oil ministers of the 20-country alliance – ten OPEC countries and ten non-OPEC exporters – stated that the large cut was needed to better align supply with reduced demand as growth slows in major industrialized economies . Many central banks are tightening financial conditions to address elevated levels of inflation – a monetary policy cycle that could precipitate recessions in European countries as well as the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil production quotas for both Russia and Saudi Arabia by 526,000 bpd each . However , because European sanctions on Russia for its Ukraine invasion have already reduced Russian oil exports , in practice only Saudi Arabia will be reducing production by that large a figure . Saudi officials add that the Kingdom ’ s acceptance of a large production cut will also help rebuild substantial Saudi spare production capacity .

Yet , some oil experts indicated that , because many of the OPEC+ members are already producing below their allotted quotas , the actual reduction in oil exports on global markets will , in fact , come close to the 1 million BPD that the U.S. and other leaders had expected . Even if the actual reduction in oil exports turns out to be far lower than the announced figure , the damage to U.S. relations with leaders of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly Saudi Arabia , is likely to be substantial . U.S. officials denounced the OPEC+ decision as “ shortsighted ” – reflecting concerns that the production cut could increase world oil prices and complicate U.S. and allied efforts to tackle inflation . This is of particular concern for the Biden administration as the production cuts will raise gas prices in the U.S. going into the midterm elections .

""""""" More than any other time in recent memory , the present moment offers many Americans a chance to make work better . American employees in 2022 have more leverage over their employers than they have had since the 1970s , the result of a confluence of factors . The pandemic that began in 2020 has prompted a widespread reevaluation about what place work should have in the lives of many Americans , who are known for putting in more hours than people in most other industrialized nations . There ’ s also been a groundswell of labor organizing that began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to larger trends like an aging population and growing income inequality . This movement has accelerated in the past two years as the pandemic has brought labor issues to the fore . “ I feel like there ’ s a change in the culture of Americans ” to become more pro-labor , said Catherine Creighton , director of the Co-Lab at Cornell University ’ s Industrial and Labor Relations school . “ The pandemic created a huge shift where people can take the time to say , ‘ What ’ s going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just stopped the clock for a moment , for people to say what ’ s important and not important , ” she said . Huge numbers of US workers have been quitting their jobs or leaving the workforce entirely , as a booming economy has created more demand for workers . This so-called Great Resignation , or Great Reshuffle , has continued even as expanded state and national unemployment benefits have run out . The ensuing labor shortages have shifted the balance of power from employers to employees — at least for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries . These conditions create a fertile ground for Americans to seek higher wages , better benefits , and improved working conditions . But that leverage will only last as long as the worker shortage . Whether these improvements continue into the future for all workers will require a mix of policy change and union growth . Considering that lawmakers are currently at a standstill in the Senate over everything from the infrastructure bill to voting rights , union organizing seems like the most promising way to push these kinds of changes forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the union for 40 years and there ’ s never been a better time to organize than right now , ” D. Taylor , international president of the hotel and food service worker union Unite Here , told Recode , citing a pro-labor administration , labor shortages , and growing economic inequality . “ I ’ ve been working for the union for 40 years and there ’ s never been a better time to organize than right now ” He said that while workers are using the current situation to eke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains are temporary and could be wiped out in coming years by inflation and layoffs . “ The only fundamental way to change the economic livelihood and the rights of workers is through the union movement , ” he said . Why now is the time Of the many effects Covid-19 has had on America , how it ’ s changed the way we think about work might be among the most indelible . The pandemic made work harder for many people and highlighted the longstanding struggles of workers across many industries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuing repercussions for health care workers finally shined a light on the industry ’ s long-ignored concerns : lengthy hours , incommensurate pay for health care workers like nurses , and the dangerous but crucial nature of their work . People who serve food and sell groceries for wages that are often too low to live on sustainably suddenly became inadvertent front-line workers , heralded for their bravery in the first waves of the pandemic ( but largely forgotten in the subsequent ones ) . And workers who toil in e-commerce warehouses or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US economy in an extreme way , as their existing complaints about inhumane treatment in the workplace went uncorrected . Even white-collar workers , whose labor is often higher paid and objectively safer than many blue-collar employees , are experiencing high rates of burnout and mental health issues , prompting them to question work ’ s meaning in their lives and whether it was ever necessary that they commute daily from their homes to work on computers somewhere else . And now , a record number of Americans have been quitting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , representing 3 percent of all employment . There are also millions more open jobs than there are Americans willing to fill them . That ’ s partly because there are 3.6 million fewer people on payrolls than there had been pre-pandemic . Labor force participation rates — the share of the population that ’ s working or looking for work — are far below pre-pandemic levels . The reasons for the decline are myriad . Older Americans — who were already on track to depart the workforce as they age — are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of 55 accounting for about half of the decline in the labor force participation rate since February 2020 . Many women have left jobs to stay home to watch children , and as the omicron variant continues to close schools and quarantine students , it ’ s keeping many of these women from returning . Some people are making ends meet by doing gig work or by starting their own businesses , which doesn ’ t always show up on BLS employment situation data geared to payrolls , and can lack safeguards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care . Others are living off investments in the stock market and alternative assets . People have rented out rooms in their homes or loaned their cars . They ’ re surviving off savings they built by staying home during the pandemic and by collecting government benefits . Many are getting by on a spouse ’ s income , by moving in with family , or simply by making do with less . At the same time , the economy is booming , meaning companies would need more workers even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This has given workers a lot more sway in the market . “ Because of the extraordinary circumstances , we are seeing a transfer of power , ” Heidi Shierholz , the president of the Economic Policy Institute , said . “ We ’ re in a really abnormal situation. ” Businesses are having no choice but to adapt . “ When I talk to leaders of companies , they ’ re literally panicking because they can ’ t fulfill their services . They can ’ t deploy their product . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they don ’ t have trained talent , ” Tsedal Neeley , a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School , told Recode . She said companies that preemptively make work better for their employees — higher pay , remote flexibility , other financial and social incentives — will have a business advantage over those that wait for their workers to demand those benefits . “ We have not completely grasped the tsunami of changes that have fallen upon us and that will continue to fall upon us ” “ We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes that have fallen upon us and that will continue to fall upon us , ” Neeley said . “ Work has changed . Workers have changed. ” Companies that can ’ t find enough workers have had to cut back hours and circumscribe their offerings because of worker shortages . Anecdotally , job listings on the hiring platform Indeed are increasingly urgent , using language like “ immediate start ” or “ start today. ” Employers are waiving requirements they used to have for job candidates , like degrees , experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play their cards right have the opportunity to get the jobs they actually want . As this is all happening , Americans are increasingly interested in — and approving of — unions , which will be able to fight for lasting change on behalf of workers . Kenneth Hagans , a catering employee at the Caesars Superdome stadium in New Orleans , is trying to form a union with his coworkers in order to improve pay ( he makes $ 12.50 per hour ) and to attain benefits ( he doesn ’ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said his employers are short-staffed , they have not raised pay , relying instead on temp workers . Hagans , who is 60 years old , has health problems and works two jobs when he ’ d like to just work one . He believes now is the time to form a union due to the poor financial circumstances many Americans find themselves in . “ Look at what ’ s going on in America — it ’ s not just happening to me , it ’ s happening in this whole country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and everything is going up , ” he said . “ You went to the grocery store — you see how high groceries are . You buy a car — you see it ’ s $ 5,000 or $ 10,000 more to buy a new car today . So the wages need to come up. ” Unite Here ’ s Taylor believes that such factors could lead to an increase in union membership in coming years . Membership rates have been declining for decades , but ticked up slightly in 2020 — @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union members were more likely to hold on to their jobs in the recession than non-union members . 2021 numbers come out later this month . Recently , a company-owned Starbucks in the US voted to unionize , and more locations around the country have followed suit . Other ongoing high-profile unionization efforts and actions by workers at companies as far afield as online retailer Amazon , tech review site Wirecutter , and food manufacturing company Kellogg ’ s could lead to even more momentum in union formation . “ It lets people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do something about this ? ” Cornell ’ s Creighton said . “ Even though it ’ s a handful of people , it can create a spark. ” That said , more robust union formation faces severe obstacles . “ The way the law is written and has been interpreted over the last 86 years has made it so that it ’ s almost impossible , in the private sector in America , to form a union , ” Creighton said . “ Even with all of these labor shortages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more leverage , it ’ s still very difficult. ” National legislation that would make it easier to unionize is languishing in the Senate . Unite Here ’ s Taylor thinks strong union efforts will still prevail . “ If the labor movement , if unions aggressively organize [ and ] are prepared to have very difficult battles with corporate America — I do [ think union membership will go up ] , ” he said . “ I think it really rests in our hands , even though all the factors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American worker stands to gain So far , the labor shortfall in the past two years alone has already brought significant gains to many workers . From February 2020 to December 2021 , hourly pay for non-manager positions rose 11 percent on average for all employees ( about double the typical growth for the equivalent time period ) . Wages grew most swiftly in the lowest-paying fields , like leisure and hospitality , which has seen pay go up 14 percent over pre-pandemic levels , though it remains objectively relatively low . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains . ) Some workers in leisure and hospitality , which is known for often having bad conditions in addition to low pay , are getting more regular schedules and a clearer path to advancement because employers are eager to fill empty positions . The specter of unionization has also forced changes . Michelle Eisen , a barista at the first unionized company-owned Starbucks , in Buffalo , New York , said that when her store filed a petition to organize a union back in August , the company began answering some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hiring more people , and offering seniority pay . Eisen , who spoke to me while taking a break from picketing outside her store on Friday , January 7 , says there ’ s still a lot of work to be done . Foremost is worker health and safety : She and other workers at her store walked out earlier that week because they had been exposed to Covid-19 by a colleague and weren ’ t allowed to quarantine with pay if they didn ’ t show symptoms . Starbucks corporate has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer isolation pay . Eisen and her colleagues have been contacted by hundreds of other Starbucks employees at locations around the country , leading her to believe her store ’ s unionization will lead to others . Of her own decision to form a union , she said that poor working conditions had brought her to her limit last year . “ I had two options : It was to either leave a company that I ’ d spent 10 years with — with people that I liked , in a store that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I really enjoyed and cared about — or we can try to make some changes from the inside , ” Eisen told Recode . These kinds of positive changes for workers aren ’ t limited to the service industry . Hiring bonuses and incentives have become increasingly popular . Some more progressive employers are seriously entertaining ideas about offering time off for mental health issues , shifting to four-day workweeks , and whether we should be working at all during the apocalypse . A college in Buffalo , New York , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a long way to go and a lot more improvements to be made . “ It ’ s very important we do something now . Because if not now , when ? ” As long as the shortfall of employees continues — which experts told us could last at least a year , but likely longer — workers have a chance to make their jobs better , either by quitting and finding more suitable work or by joining a union . It ’ s possible that US policy will change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some politicians are floating ideas of offering universal basic income , which would set a basic standard of living for all Americans , regardless of their work status . There could be a future in which all Americans have access to parental leave and paid time off — not just those lucky enough to have jobs that provide those benefits . Neeley , however , has little faith that policy will change . But right now , that might not matter . She said work is getting better because employers have no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react to market forces or these exogenous shocks that started with Covid , ” Neeley said . “ If you want to hire , if you want to retain , if you want to meet your basic objectives in your organization , whether it ’ s a small business or these large enterprises , you need people. ” For some white-collar workers , that ’ s meant they ’ ve been able to attain long-sought-after perks like remote work , which enables them to save time commuting and have a better work-life balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than half the workforce exclusively worked from home , according to survey data from Gallup . Now , approximately a quarter of employed people are doing so , while another 20 percent are working from home some of the time , in what ’ s called a hybrid model . We ’ ve learned from the pandemic that many more could work remotely — and the current situation is primed for workers to demand it . But the unique advantages of this time won ’ t necessarily last . Depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with this moment , we could end up with a culture of work that ’ s better , or not . “ Now is the time where people are realizing , due to labor shortages and what they ’ ve been through in the last few years , that they could have momentum to change their working lives , ” Creighton said . “ It ’ s very important we do something now .

""""""" LVIV , Ukraine ( AP ) — She stood in just her bathrobe in the freezing basement of the Mariupol theater , coated in white plaster dust shaken loose by the explosion . Her husband tugged at her to leave and begged her to cover her eyes . But she couldn ’ t help it — Oksana Syomina looked . And to this day , she wishes she hadn ’ t . Bodies were strewn everywhere , including those of children . By the main exit , a little girl lay still on the floor . Syomina had to step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had served as the Ukrainian city ’ s main bomb shelter for more than a week . The wounded screamed , as did those trying to find loved ones . Syomina , her husband and about 30 others ran blindly toward the sea and up the shore for almost five miles ( eight kilometers ) without stopping , the theater in ruins behind them . “ All the people are still under the rubble , because the rubble is still there — no one dug them up , ” Syomina said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one big mass grave. ” Amid all the horrors that have unfolded in the war on Ukraine , the Russian bombing of the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater in Mariupol on March 16 stands out as the single deadliest known attack against civilians to date . An Associated Press investigation has found evidence that the attack was in fact far deadlier than estimated , killing closer to 600 people inside and outside the building . That ’ s almost double the death toll cited so far , and many survivors put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreated what happened inside the theater on that day from the accounts of 23 survivors , rescuers , and people intimately familiar with its new life as a bomb shelter . The AP also drew on two sets of floor plans of the theater , photos and video taken inside before , during and after that day and feedback from experts who reviewed the methodology . With communications severed , people coming and going constantly , and memories blurred by trauma , an exact toll is impossible to determine . The government estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has since opened a war crimes investigation , according to a document obtained by the AP . AP journalists arrived at a much higher number through the reconstruction of a 3D model of the building ’ s floorplan reviewed repeatedly by direct witnesses , most from within the theater , who described in detail where people were sheltering . All the witnesses said at least 100 people were at a field kitchen just outside , and none survived . They also said the rooms and hallways inside the building were packed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square meters of free space . Many survivors estimated around 1,000 people were inside at the time of the airstrike , but the most anyone saw escape , including rescuers , was around 200 . The survivors primarily left through the main exit or one side entrance ; the other side and the back were crushed . The AP investigation also refutes Russian claims that the theater was demolished by Ukrainian forces or served as a Ukrainian military base . None of the witnesses saw Ukrainian soldiers operating inside the building . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was destroyed in a Russian air attack aimed with precision at a civilian target everyone knew was the city ’ s largest bomb shelter , with children in it . James Gow , a professor of international security at King ’ s College London , said documenting what happened at the theater is critical to establishing a pattern of crimes against humanity in Ukraine . “ This strong witness testimony will be important in establishing that ( Russian illegal ) conduct was widespread or systematic , ” said Gow , who also served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia . Mariupol has taken on outsize importance as a symbol of the devastation inflicted by Russian forces and of the resistance from Ukraine . The city ’ s fate is now hanging in the balance , and officials say around 20,000 civilians died during the Russian siege . With Mariupol cut off from access , many fear the bombing of the theater presages more war crimes that have yet to be discovered . The elegant theater had stood in a square in the heart of Mariupol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone building with white pillars , a classical frieze , and a distinctive red roof . It was once called the Russian Dramatic Theater , but local authorities removed the word “ Russian ” from the name in 2015 . Last July , they ordered all performances to be conducted in Ukrainian . The Russian siege of Mariupol started in the first days of March . The actors , designers and administrators who ran the theater took refuge there a few days later , on March 5 . About 60 people spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 600 , according to Elena Bila , who was a stage manager there for 19 years . The city soon ordered the entire building opened as a bomb shelter , given its size , its unusually sturdy walls and its large basement . On the first day , about 600 people showed up , Bila said . Every day , more and more people came , and they settled in the corridors . A group of 16 men formed a security committee , taking shifts to guard the front doors . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were safe , ” Bila said . “ In fact , they weren ’ t safe. ” About a week before the bombing , the theater ’ s set designer used white paint to inscribe the word “ CHILDREN ” in Cyrillic letters on the pavement outside , in the hope of staving off an attack from above . The signs , painted in both the front and back entrances , were large enough to be read even from satellites . On March 9 , a Russian airstrike hit a maternity hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three pregnant women moved to the theater for safety , according to two theater employees . The women , along with families with small children , were given the most comfortable dressing rooms on the second floor , along a corridor behind the stage . It would turn out to be their doom . By March 15 , around 1,200 people crammed into the building , sleeping in offices , corridors , balconies , the basement . They lined the curved hallways and the warren of backstage offices and dressing rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once-plush seats whose stuffing was used as kindling for cooking fires . But they avoided sleeping on the stage , which sat beneath a domed ceiling and felt uncomfortably like the bullseye it turned out to be . Only pets — cats and dogs — were kept there , directly under the dome . The cavernous basement prop room beneath it was empty . By this time , the city no longer had electricity , food and water . The theater became a place where anyone could get food and water supplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuations . A water tank stood out front , and the field kitchen operated to one side . People also flocked to the theater as the most likely starting point for any evacuations , to get near the front of the line . New arrivals registered at the entrance , where the cloakroom used to be . Just past the registration was what served as a warm welcome : A stand with hot tea . Among those who showed up in the hope of evacuating on the morning of March 16 were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation they might have had about abandoning their home evaporated when the building next door caught fire . The six of them ran past a Russian tank , past a hospital already destroyed by shelling , then inadvertently toward another Russian tank , whose turret turned in their direction and opened fire . They hid briefly in the ruins of the children ’ s clinic at the hospital . Then they ran down a side street for the final half-mile ( kilometer ) to the theater . “ We were immediately offered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 56-year-old matriarch . “ You have to imagine , we had hardly eaten or drunk for six days . Everyone was so happy because of the hot tea. ” Lunch was at noon , they were told , and in the meantime , they could find space . The basement was full already . So were the first and second floors . They saw a spot on the third floor , near enormous windows that everyone knew would surely shatter into knives of flying glass if the building was hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they took it . They swept it up with a broom and laid out the sheets they ’ d grabbed from home . It was just before 10 a.m. Maria Kutnyakova , Galina ’ s 30-year-old daughter , walked through the entire building in search of free space , noting the full rooms . She left her mother to handle the registration and went out by herself to find her uncle , who lived nearby . They hadn ’ t seen him in nine days . That ’ s when she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading to the Azovstal steel plant . She walked a little further , and heard a single plane , much closer . Then came the explosion . As she hugged the edge of the nearest building , she thought to herself , “ So it exploded . Let it explode . I ’ ve heard a million bombs like that , and the bottom line is it didn ’ t hit me. ” But she saw smoke rising from the enormous park with the theater at the center . The theater stood bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red roof on the ground . The meter ( three-foot ) thick walls by the field kitchen had disintegrated to dust . Her mind froze . Her mother and sister were inside . The airstrike hit around 10 a.m. , squarely on the stage and field kitchen . Maria Radionova had laid out a corner for herself and her two dogs just underneath , in the hall of the drama theater with the chandelier . The roof caved in and the chandelier shattered . Radionova wasn ’ t there . She had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to the theater . She heard the telltale whistle from a plane . A man grabbed her by the neck , pressed her against a wall and covered her . Debris and fragments of bricks flew at them . The explosion threw another man back and face down onto glass . A wounded woman lay nearby in a huge pool of blood . Radionova went back into the theater and tried to get into the hall . People were running and screaming , and lost children were frantically looking for their mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . “ They were all I had , ” she said , crying . “ This ( was ) actually my family . … I cried there for probably two hours. ” Victoria Dubovytska , 24 , had just folded blankets into a pile in the projection room where she was staying with her 2-year-old daughter , Anastasia , and 6-year-old son , Artem . When the bomb hit , they were thrown against the wall . The blankets tumbled on top of the toddler , shielding her small body from the slabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds after the shock , the room was silent . Dubovytska feared her daughter was dead . Then Anastasia ’ s voice joined the other screams : “ Mama ! ” “ I understood she was alive , ” Dubovytska recalled . “ I dragged her out….It was a miracle she survived. ” She took her son , her daughter and any documents she could find and ran out of the theater . Half of it had already crumbled . As people fled the opposite way , Maria Kutnyakova ran into the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went to the third floor , but the windows were shattered and there was no sign of her loved ones or their belongings . Hoarse shouts for family members filled the air . At first she too shouted “ Mom , ” but she quickly realized that everyone around her was shouting the same word . So she screamed the family name instead . Someone answered , “ Masha Kutnyakova ! ” With everyone shouting , she couldn ’ t figure out where the voice came from . It sounded like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only the dead lay there . She thought she was going crazy . She went to the stairs down to the basement and bomb shelter . There , at the bottom , stood her sister , covered in plaster dust , with a cat . She had been on the third floor and fled to the basement for cover . Their mother wasn ’ t upstairs but on the ground floor , near the medic ’ s office , and escaped out of a side exit . They made their way with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mariupol ’ s Philharmonic , a nearby auditorium that was also serving as a shelter . That too came under shelling at sunset . “ I wasn ’ t killed in the theater , but I ’ m going to die in the philharmonic , ” Maria Kutnyakova told herself bitterly . “ God , this is my cultural program for the day. ” The shockwave from the explosion also reverberated outside the theater . March 16 was Dmitriy Yurin ’ s 31st birthday . He was headed the 100 meters from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done every morning in the past week , for food and water . Near the entrance to the parking garage , the force of the blast knocked him to the ground . Yurin , a fisherman , picked himself up and ran to help , moving rubble to drag out those who were alive but couldn ’ t walk . “ I looked at my arms , and they were covered in blood up to the elbow , ” he said . “ And I was in a stupor , just shock. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect himself and rub off some of the blood , then returned . Most of the bodies were unreachable deep in the foundations , which were now in flames . Anybody they could reach , rescuers moved to the park . “ Some of them weren ’ t alive , and some of them breathed their last on the street , ” Yurin remembered , sighing . “ We said goodbye to them. ” One young woman - maybe 25 years old - stood out in his memory . He stuttered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out on a bare winter flowerbed , still conscious . Two women and a child stood by her , trying to reassure her through their tears . “ We ’ ll live , don ’ t die , everything will be fine , ” they said . “ You ’ ll get help. ” But she died in front of him . Yurin left soon after . He numbly pulled on a neoprene suit he used for fishing on cold winter days and wrapped his feet in plastic bags . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly a kilometer ( half-mile ) “ like a dog ” before emerging outside Mariupol . It took days , but he eventually made his way to safety in western Ukraine . Yulia Marukhnenko also had been renting an apartment near the theater . When she heard the bang , Marukhnenko first looked to the field kitchen , but she knew everybody there was buried . So she rushed to the basements . Trained in first aid , with a full kit on hand , she was facing problems no first aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no bodies , bodies with no limbs , bones sticking out . Those were the ones who died , either on the spot or in the days afterwards in a city with almost no functioning hospitals . One woman had her leg amputated but died anyway . Marukhnenko and the two police officers working alongside her said a dozen people were pulled from the rubble , the last one around 4 p.m. , six hours after the airstrike . Her name was Nadia . Still in shock , Nadia said the explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they died in the basement . The woman cradled a dachshund that belonged to her son , who had named the puppy Gloria . Nadia begged her rescuers to take the dog . She asked for a cigarette . She said she hadn ’ t smoked for seven months because her son had asked her to quit . But there was no longer anybody to quit for . Nadia was taken to the hospital , and Marukhnenko doesn ’ t know what happened to her . The dog is with Marukhnenko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell her that Gloria is fine , ” Marukhnenko said . “ She ’ s eating well , she ’ s all right , and she ’ s with me. ” The theater now lies in ruins , with its side and center blackened by fire . Russian forces control the neighborhood around it , and AP video shows heavy equipment swarming the rubble to further dismantle it . But the questions remain : How many bodies are there , and what happened to them ? A police officer who passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell of death was overpowering . He spoke on condition of anonymity because he still has relatives in Russia-controlled territory . Video taken by Russian state media shows no bodies inside , contrary to the descriptions of multiple witnesses . The lack of bodies led the police officer and a Mariupol Red Cross official to speculate that perhaps fewer than 500 people died , but most survivors suggested the bodies were either pulverized into the dust or removed by the Russians . With the site off-limits to investigators and the rubble itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and video of the theater before and after it was bombed will be crucial , said Clint Williamson , who served as U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues from 2006 to 2009 . “ Without being able to get to the scene , it is going to be difficult to go much beyond that , ” he said . The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has declared the attack on the Mariupol drama theater an “ egregious violation ” of international humanitarian law . The organization ’ s mid-April report found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it committed a war crime. ” It also found no dispute that the destruction of the theater was deliberate . This finding was echoed by two munitions experts interviewed by the AP , who said the scope of the destruction points to a 500-kilogram bomb from a Russian warplane . “ It ’ s much too much for an artillery shell , ” said Mark Cancian , an explosives analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former artillery officer . “ The fact that it hit square on would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were aiming at. ” Russian troops want to take over Mariupol because of its strategic value as a port and a link between territories in the south and east held by Russia-friendly forces . Moscow has declared victory , but Ukraine refuses to acknowledge defeat . In the meantime , families are desperate for any news of loved ones . A Telegram channel for Ukraine ’ s missing has more than 19,000 posts , with photos and other details . More than 9,600 refer to Mariupol alone . The survivors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of what the Russians did . “ They came not to capture the city — they came to destroy it , ” said Maria Kutnyakova , sitting in another auditorium in the city of Lviv where artists recently staged a show to honor Mariupol ’ s theater and those killed inside . “ They are trying to hide how many people actually died in Mariupol , hide their crimes. ” Beatrice Dupuy and Marshall Ritzel in New York , and Cara Anna in Lviv , contributed to this report .

Fulmer in particular had branded himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional work around their idyllic marriage . Consequently , the Try Guys cheating scandal fully subsumed social media in collective shock , hurt , and mourning . When the rest of the Try Guys ( Keith Habersberger , Eugene Lee Yang , and Zach Kornfeld ) finally spoke out on Monday to confirm that the allegations were true and that they ’ d parted ways with Fulmer , their fans quickly valorized them . On their face , each of these scandals seems pretty different . Yet each has culled a level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shift from the cheating scandals of the past , which were essentially tawdry cautionary tales and little else . When we look at them more closely , we see a set of competing narratives about power , gender , and relationships that don ’ t always align with reality — but do tell us a lot about ourselves . On September 19 , 23-year-old model Sumner Stroh came forward on TikTok to accuse 43-year-old Levine of having a year-long affair with her . After cheating on his pregnant wife , Victoria ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegedly DM ’ d Stroh to ask if he could name the baby after Sumner . As creepy as that is , Levine looked even smarmier once three other women also spoke out to accuse Levine of sending flirty texts like “ I may need to see the booty. ” In an Instagram post , Levine later denied having a physical relationship with anyone , but admitted to utilizing “ poor judgment ” and “ cross [ ing ] the line during a regrettable period in my life. ” These accusations ranged widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levine of disrupting her life by sending her a single flirtatious text and then ghosting her in 2010 , four years before he married Prinsloo . Another failed to produce anything more shocking than texts revealing that Levine is an ass man . Still , they all had the basic theme of Levine behaving inappropriately , usually with much younger women — and they introduced a theme that ran throughout the subsequent discourse around the other cheating scandals as well : the imbalanced power dynamic of these relationships . “ At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naive , and , I mean , quite frankly , I feel exploited , ” Stroh stated in her TikTok about the alleged affair . “ I was very easily manipulated. ” Other onlookers expanded on Stroh ’ s point , including actress Emily Ratajkowski . “ I don ’ t understand why we continue to blame women for men ’ s mistakes , especially when you ’ re talking about 20-something-year-old women dealing with men in positions of power who are twice their age , ” Ratajkowski stated in a pointed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so skewed , it ’ s ridiculous . It ’ s predatory , it ’ s manipulative. ” Remaining aware of the power dynamics at play was also a priority for the staff who dealt with the fallout of the other scandals . “ We as an organization have a responsibility to support [ female staff members ] , ” Celtics executive Brad Stevens stated in the wake of Udoka ’ s suspension , noting that many of them had been “ dragged unfairly ” into the social media gossip about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement “ to our players , fans , the entire Celtics organization , and my family for letting them down. ” ) Meanwhile , the Try Guys were so sensitive to the optics around the Fulmer scandal that they spent Monday ’ s clarification video discussing their efforts to completely erase Fulmer himself , literally , from their videos and merchandise . While the rumor mill is flowing with numerous anonymous allegations that the other members of the Try Guys team witnessed Fulmer ’ s sexual misconduct in person multiple times , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the scandal , saying they had no idea . “ We refused to sweep things under the rug , ” Yang stated . “ That is not who we are and it ’ s not what we stand for. ” It ’ s not just the Guys who are focused on the optics . All of these scandals seem to reflect a major shift in how the people involved and the general public think about the parameters of a cheating scandal . For what may be the first time ever , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just “ who did it ” and “ who ’ s the villain. ” Historically , the cheating narrative has always been inherently misogynistic , reifying our tropes about the evil other woman , hammering away at the virgin/whore dichotomy , questioning the behavior of the spurned party , and rarely if ever focusing on the cheating partner . The “ Jolenes ” of the world were given a witchy mystical ability to steal even the strongest man , while marriage , even monogamy itself , tended to be framed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either pine for men who would never change or evolve beyond them into independence . If a man stepped out of his wife and the public learned about it , the prevailing cultural attitude held that she had failed to adequately perform any of her many wifely duties as home manager , housekeeper , mother , caretaker , and fully accommodating sexual partner . This pattern arguably began to shift with Beyonce ’ s 2016 stunner Lemonade , which largely centered around her feelings and reactions to husband Jay-Z ’ s cheating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverbial “ other woman ” ( the aforementioned “ Becky , ” who drew attention but wasn ’ t the focus ) , Bey transformed the anger into a narrative of personal empowerment . She also initially released the whole album on the streaming platform owned by Jay-Z , so Lemonade ironically became a way of consolidating their power couple status . The Lemonade narrative was perhaps the most successful narrative yet at forging a new path between “ fruitless pining ” and “ I don ’ t need a man. ” And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to destroy another woman to do it . In 2017 , the cheating narrative gained another element of complexity , this time at the expense of Joss Whedon . Whedon ’ s longstanding image as an outspoken feminist creator had been deteriorating for some time in his post-Avengers era , but it took its biggest hit yet when his ex-wife Kai Cole alleged that his feminism was just a front for years of cheating . Whedon , Cole alleged , preyed on much younger women , usually women he worked with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamics , and Cole emphasized that Whedon used his feminism as a way of masking his manipulative tactics and gaslighting women who would question them , including Cole herself . Cole ’ s narrative about her relationship with Whedon arrived right before the Me Too movement and preceded what would soon become culture-wide conversations about imbalanced workplace relationships . By confronting the idea that her husband ’ s cheating was dually a form of emotional abuse and a form of predation , Cole created an approach to talking about infidelity that broke away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aligned with more complex Me Too themes . Me Too awoke us , culturally , to countless reductive and gendered stereotypes around the ways we discuss everything from sexual harassment to monogamy . Inevitably , the conversation around cheating began to focus on the man at the center of the scandal . This change arguably happened not only because of the Me Too movement , but also because of our increasingly intimate parasocial relationships . We ’ re far removed from the peak era of the Hollywood idol , when stormy celebrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Now , they often play out on social media among famous people who feel like our pals . We got our first real taste of this , culturally speaking , when John Mulaney cheated on his wife of six years , artist Anna Marie Tendler . Like Fulmer , Mulaney had become known for being a “ wife guy ” — a dude whose personality presents itself , rightly or wrongly , as “ I love my wife ! ” Like Fulmer , Mulaney ’ s often ironically banal comic style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose parasocial relationships with him led them to feel deep outrage and betrayal over the idea that he could have cheated on a woman he spent years publicly adoring . But unfortunately , neither Mulaney ’ s nor Fulmer ’ s “ wife guy ” brand could stand up to reality . The parasocial aspect is arguably the last new piece of the cheating scandal ’ s evolution , but it ’ s one of the thorniest . It also indicates how complicated some of our conversations around cheating have become — maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about cheating has changed — but has it changed that much ? The problem with our newly woke awareness of cheating is that the old cheating narratives haven ’ t disappeared . They ’ re still with us , bound up in all the typical stereotypes about broken relationships — only now they ’ re competing with a barrage of endless social media takes that turn these individual scandals into parts of much larger conversations about gender . All the while , the women who come forward with these allegations still endure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Current conversations still incorporate “ the other woman is evil ” trope , this time abutting the “ how could a man cheat on this perfect woman ” outcry . The public conversation still too frequently relegates women to flat caricatures of themselves , even if the caricatures are supposedly positive . Then there ’ s the overexposure of the people involved and the treatment of the scandal itself as newsworthy beyond its actual merits . The fact that all of this happens online and on social media makes the scandal feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ’ ve never heard of the Try Guys in my life , ” a friend told me in the wake of the Fulmer allegations . “ Now they ’ re everywhere . Do I have to know who these people are ? ” The performance of public outrage can feel exhausting — and in some cases , like Levine ’ s banal sexting , like a throwback to Victorian-era sexual politics . Because of the ongoing advance of purity culture across the internet , it ’ s become far too easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy cheated on his pregnant wife with being scandalized and shocked that a guy likes sex at all , or that two adults were — gasp ! — flirting . At the same time , because of our newfound awareness of the elements of coercion , power , and manipulation that can accompany cheating , our outrage often conflates “ cheating ” with far more serious sexual transgressions like much more aggressive nonconsensual behavior and sexual misconduct . Amid all of the gossip and discourse , the speculations about who the involved parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensual workplace relationship ” memes , we have to ask : Ultimately , is any of this our business ? Is any of it really newsworthy ? Is it all just an excuse to gawk at celebrities and put their lives under a microscope of extreme moral scrutiny ? Behind every celebrity scandal are real people trying to cope with serious life circumstances — and even if they seem trivial to us , the onslaught of public opinion attaching to a public figure can make any situation 10 times worse . That said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our relationships to celebrities have more to do with what we project upon them than the celebrities themselves . The cheating scandal too often turns women into scapegoats for the behavior of cheating men , and too often allows the public to demonize them . Now , while the cheating scandal has in some ways become more black and white than ever , it ’ s also started to crystallize many of the ideas Me Too raised . We ’ re starting to ask what drives people to cheat , and in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creepy power dynamics and emotionally abusive situations . Those conversations are good for us , even if they lead to an overwhelming onslaught of takes and social media fatigue . It also seems clear that the public interest isn ’ t dying down soon . So , no , you don ’ t need to know who the Try Guys are . Just know that this cheating episode , like all of them , holds a mirror up to our own relationships and invites us to peek inside — if we dare . """""""

"The “Socialism 2023” conference took place in Chicago from September 1 to 4. It was sponsored by Haymarket Books and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), along with a handful of pseudo-left organizations, including Left Voice, Socialist Alternative, Tempest, Firebrand and splinters from the now-defunct International Socialist Organization (ISO), which used to organize the annual conference. The event, held under the slogan “Politics. Education. Community,” had a thoroughly bourgeois-academic character. It was dominated by the self-absorption and reactionary politics of the upper middle class milieu populating the DSA, the fraudulent “reformists” of the trade union bureaucracy and pro-imperialist state operatives. The political concepts and viewpoints put forth were squarely within the political and ideological framework of the Democratic Party, from the moral-religious “ethics of care,” to obsessions over issues related to identity politics, to support for US imperialism."
"Summit County needs two political parties, and the sooner the better. We as a society function better when we have reasonable options and this we do not have here. Don’t take my word for it concerning our Summit County one-party system, as the local websites of the Democratic and Republican parties speak for themselves. The home pages of both parties are similar and yes, they both ask for donations upfront. Neither party says “please.” So far, so good, so American! They both want our money. And, given that every elected official is a Democrat (commissioners, sheriff, clerk, treasurer, assessor, coroner, state House and Senate, U.S. House, a couple of lawyers — attorney general and district attorney, and CU regent, in order of their website appearances), it is easy to determine their positions on various issues via a series of website clicks. It is more challenging to determine where the opposition party stands on any issues when there are no elected officials, candidates or position statements to be found. Yes, it is only 2023, and our continuous election cycle won’t really kick in until after the Super Bowl, but it is never too early to review our choices. Why can’t the Republican party here — not in Washington or Denver, but right here in Summit County — put forth a candidate or two that can win an election at the local level? What’s wrong with running a fiscally conservative candidate who stays away from the social issue positions that are repugnant to many?"

""""""" Florida Lawmakers Let Bills to Protect Doctors ’ Freedom of Speech Die For months , Florida Gov . Ron DeSantis has spoken publicly about his hope lawmakers in his state would create a law protecting doctors who want to prescribe what they think is best for patients , even if it goes against current CDC and NIH guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 . Action he took on Feb. 24 offers protection from lawsuits under new Florida Department of Health guidelines giving health care providers “ flexibility to treat patients with off-label prescriptions if they determine it could help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient would like to try. ” But days after that announcement , it seemed there was no hope for the passage of related bills DeSantis had urged lawmakers to pass to protect doctors ’ freedom of speech . The now-stalled bills would have protected doctors from penalties for speaking with patients , or publicly , about treatments that go against the official recommendations of government authorities . Many doctors told The Epoch Times the measure was needed because throughout the pandemic they ’ ve faced backlash—including investigations leading to the possible stripping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wearing of masks , or for advocating for off-label use of medications , such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine . Though the regular legislative session comes to an end on March 11 , DeSantis still appeared hopeful as late as Feb. 25 , when he tweeted a thank you to bill sponsors “ for protecting the free speech of doctors and bucking the politicized medical establishment . Looking forward to these bills hitting my desk. ” Yet , after considering them in committees , lawmakers in both the Florida House and Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a full vote . Insiders familiar with the process say that it ’ s too late now to get the bills passed because committee work at the Florida Capitol is over . Dr. Eduardo Balbona , of Jacksonville , had hoped desperately that the legislation would pass , and that DeSantis would be able to sign it into law . Balbona faced a barrage of relentless insults and threatening calls after testifying in court that a COVID-19 patient on a ventilator in Mayo Clinic Florida still could survive if treated with ivermectin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by independent doctors to treat the disease . The patient ’ s family had begged the court to force Mayo Clinic to allow the treatment as a last-ditch effort to save their loved one , Dan Pisano . They were denied , then denied again on appeal , and Pisano died shortly thereafter . After that , some of Balbona ’ s recovered patients shared their stories of recovery from serious COVID-19 with The Epoch Times . That drew more ire against him . Since then , Balbona says he has received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his medical license could be at stake . “ I have spent my entire adult life working to become a good physician , ” Balbona said . “ The possibility of this being taken away is terrifying to myself , my wife , and family . “ The fact that my medical license could be taken away by a simple accusation , by those who would dictate all opinions in this pandemic , is simply wrong . “ There are cases of physicians losing their medical license over legitimate disagreements regarding Covid treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules in this conflict are patently unfair with no risks or consequences for the accusers , while the consequences for the physician accused of any infraction are devastating . “ The public has a vested interest in protecting the independence , integrity , and honesty of their physicians . Freedom of speech is essential to our good health . “ I still have faith in truth and intellectual integrity , even if I ’ ve lost faith in our health care institutions during this pandemic. ” Florida osteopath Anthony Ruffa , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes the legislation would allow him to practice in his new state without worry . In Pennsylvania , where he maintains a residence and saw patients for 30 years , he was investigated by licensing authorities and later cleared . But he ’ s still not sure why they acted in the first place . He says he suspects it had something to do with the fact that he had shared and commented on more than 100 articles from The Epoch Times on his social media pages , including Linkedin . “ They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDC guidelines , ” Ruffa said . In February , he received a chilling letter , signed by Adam J. Williams , prosecuting attorney for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . “ The Prosecution Division of the Department of State ’ s Office of Chief Counsel , on behalf of the Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs , has completed its inquiry into a complaint alleging that you provided false or misleading information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic , ” the letter to Ruffa stated . “ Following review , this office has decided not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on : “ Investigations by this office are confidential and privileged . Therefore , this office can not provide you with a more detailed explanation of the evidence gathered during the investigation or the specific reasoning that led to this office ’ s decision . “ As in all cases , we reserve the right to reopen this case at our discretion . You should continue to follow all orders issued by the Governor ’ s office , the Department of Health , and the Centers for Disease Control ( sic ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your cooperation in this matter. ” Even though Ruffa was cleared of any wrongdoing , “ the problem now is , every time I renew my four state licenses , apply for malpractice [ insurance ] or apply for a new job , I have to report that I was investigated , and that becomes a real problem. ” After the investigation , “ I took down my Linkedin articles . I had over 2000 followers , but I was intimidated enough to do so . I was only trying to educate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical opinions . “ It is odd that other physicians can speak out for abortion—my body , my choice—and be socially and professionally lauded , but when we try to give informed consent regarding the vaccine or early treatment , we are squelched . “ I am not an anti-vaxer . But I think was accused of spreading misinformation regarding early treatment , masks and/or the vaccine. ” Before the investigation , he had reached out to a Pennsylvania private school and encouraged administrators to stop requiring students to wear masks . Ruffa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unvaccinated dancers who ’ d recovered from the virus to wear masks . He said he had also questioned Mayo Clinic when that health organization would not allow him to attend a medical conference without being vaccinated , despite having had the virus and being “ naturally immune. ” “ During this pandemic , I pushed back every time I could with articles on the Internet , Facebook , Linkedin , and I encouraged for early treatments . The investigator concurred that as long as I had an opinion on the articles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would be fine. ” The “ ignorance ” of fellow doctors and the chilling effect of fear on their ability to do their job alarmed him , he said . Based on communications he ’ s had , Ruffa said he believes physicians are failing to report reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine “ for fear of intimidation. ” The Senate bill officially still under consideration in Florida , but unlikely now to move forward , was a measure prohibiting certain authorities “ from reprimanding , sanctioning or revoking , or threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or registration , of a health care practitioner for the specified use of his or her right of free speech , ” unless that speech was found to have “ led to the direct physical harm ” of a patient .

And in the House , a similarly worded bill hadn ’ t moved beyond the Health and Human Services Committee . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had warned the bill would cause an increased workload in the state health department due to a requirement in the legislation to notify doctors of any complaints within seven days . The department estimated that 12 full-time employees would be required at a total cost of about $ 805,000 per year . Both bills had provisions allowing for doctors to face penalties if it could be proven that patients were harmed by opinions they ’ d shared .

"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Republicans attacked Robert F.

The Republican National Committee and Trump’s campaign both took aim at Kennedy’s liberal background while national Democrats stayed silent as Kennedy insisted in a speech in Philadelphia that he was leaving both political parties behind. “Voters should not be deceived by anyone who pretends to have conservative values,” said Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung in a statement.

The corporate leaders estimated that as much as 3 million barrels of oil and its products a day could be lost from Russia as a result of sanctions , in line with previous estimates , and warned that global markets face a squeeze on diesel with Europe most at risk of a “ systemic ” shortage that could lead to fuel rationing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s concerned about will be diesel supplies . Europe imports about half of its diesel from Russia and about half of its diesel from the Middle East , ” said Russell Hardy , chief of Switzerland-based oil trader Vitol . “ That systemic shortfall of diesel is there. ” Those imports mean that Russian supplies account for about 15 % of Europe ’ s diesel consumption , according to the FT which carried their comments . Hardy said the shift to more diesel consumption over gasoline in Europe had helped to create shortages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refineries could boost their diesel output in response to higher prices at the expense of other oil-derived products to shore up supply , but warned that rationing was a possibility . Torbjorn Tornqvist , co-founder and chair of Geneva-headquartered Gunvor Group , added : “ Diesel is not just a European problem ; this is a global problem . It really is. ” Tornqvist also warned that European gas markets were no longer functioning properly as traders faced huge demands from banks for cash to cover hedging positions . “ I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ” he said . “ I never thought that somebody could say ‘ ah , gas has fallen below 100 per megawatt hours is really cheap ’ . ” Gas futures linked to TTF , Europe ’ s wholesale gas price have swung from about €70 a megawatt hour before Russia ’ s invasion of Ukraine to about €230 two weeks ago and then slid below €100 this week . Before May 2021 , European gas prices were below €20 a megawatt hour . As noted last week , Europe ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central banks to provide emergency liquidity support to keep gas and power markets functioning as sharp price moves triggered by the Ukraine crisis have strained commodity markets . Hardy said that to move a cargo equivalent to 1 megawatt hour of liquefied natural gas priced at €97 , traders must provide €80 in cash , straining their capital requirements . Worse , confirming that Europe faces an even colder winter , Tornqvist said European utilities would struggle to fill gas storage for next winter given the “ paralysed ” state of the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide guarantees to protect buyers against price swings . But going back to diesel , Bloomberg ’ s Javier Blas tweeted a handful of the scariest quotes from the energy CEOs at today ’ s FT commodities summit : • Trafigura CEO Jeremy Weir : “ The diesel market is extremely tight . It ’ s going to get tighter and will probably lead into stock outs ” referring to when fuel stations run dry . • Gunvor CEO : “ Europe is so short of diesel ” • Vitol CEO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about will be diesel supplies ” Needless to say , without diesel , not only will traffic in Europe grind to a halt , but much if not all US truck based logistical support and supply chains will soon be paralyzed . The consequences for the global economy will be dire . """""""
"The grain spat threatening to wipe out goodwill between Poland and Ukraine Grain is transferred to a truck from Wieslaw Gryn's farm in Rogow, Poland, on Sept. 19. (Karolina Jonderko for The Washington Post) Listen 7 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save ROGOW, Poland — There is so much grain at Wieslaw Gryn’s farm in eastern Poland — the farm his family has run for two centuries — that wheat kernels are spilling out of the storage barn and into the yard. “There’s no space in the silos,” Gryn, 65, said as he tapped one of the metal towers holding grain harvested from the fields that stretch toward the Ukrainian border. “Full,” he said. “All full.”"
""""""" When it comes to spending power , inflation means that things cost more and that your money becomes less valuable . When a period of high inflation hits — like right now — you may want to consider changing up the way you handle your finances to help protect the value of your cash . `` Inflation is a time for investors and savers to reevaluate their strategies , '' said Walter Russell , CEO of financial adviser firm Russell and Company . Through the Federal Reserve , the government tries to combat inflation on a large scale by raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest rate that commercial banks use to borrow and lend money to each other . When the cost of borrowing becomes more expensive , higher interest rates trickle down to consumer banking products such as loans and mortgages , making them more expensive . But higher interest rates may also apply to deposit accounts , meaning that banks start to offer higher interest rates on checking , savings and certificates of deposit . No one knows what the future will bring , but by making changes to how you spend and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to weather times of inflation more easily . Here are some ways to save during periods of inflation . It can be frustrating not to be able to get loans for big purchases as easily during periods of high inflation . Still , consumers can take advantage of higher interest rates on bank accounts to fight the effects of inflation on their cash . Bank account interest rates usually do n't totally beat the rate of inflation , but these accounts can help hedge against inflation far better than keeping cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The national average annual percentage yield for savings accounts is 0.06 % , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , but there are plenty of financial institutions that offer rates that are much higher — some even 1.00 % APY or more . To find these rates , you can research high-yield or high-interest accounts and choose the bank that works best for you . If you have n't looked over your budget in a while , now may be a good time . During the pandemic , you may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't use anymore , or you might be spending more money dining out or paying for more convenience services now . You can bike more often instead of driving everywhere , and you can reevaluate your food budget to add more cheap healthy meals . For a bigger change , you could downsize your housing to save even more money . Consider investing or buying bonds for long-term savings It 's a good idea to keep short-term cash — like an emergency fund — accessible in a savings account , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to need for a year or more , you may want to consider investing those funds or buying a treasury bond . `` For someone who has a lot of cash sitting on the sideline , ( investing ) could help you not lose money , '' Russell said . `` More people might be willing to take on more risk because they want a higher rate of return . '' Russell also recommends that consumers look into getting TreasuryDirect Series I savings bonds , which can give an interest rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 for a one-year term . These bonds are basically like a certificate of deposit : You put your money in one for a year , and by the end of the year you have a guaranteed rate of return that hopefully stays higher than the current rate of inflation — so your money wo n't lose value . The government will continue to review inflation data and make appropriate changes to the federal funds rate . However , there are other factors that may slow inflation in the coming year , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might free up inventory and lead to lower prices for goods . No matter whether inflation goes up or down , though , it 's a good idea to keep an eye on ways to optimize your savings .

"The French Communist Party is calling for a ‘new type of union’ between fellow left-wing parties in France, after radical left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise (LFI) found itself in hot water over its response to the recent Hamas attack on Israel. “The seriousness of the international situation, as in France, calls on the left to live up to its responsibilities. Unfortunately, it has not”, the French Communist Party (PCF), which is also part of the left-wing alliance NUPES, said in a statement issued on Sunday. The PCF, which met at its National Council, suggests ending NUPES, the alliance formed for the legislative elections in June 2022.

A tracking tool installed on many hospitals ’ websites has been collecting patients ’ sensitive health information—including details about their medical conditions , prescriptions , and doctor ’ s appointments—and sending it to Facebook . The Markup tested the websites of Newsweek ’ s top 100 hospitals in America . On 33 of them we found the tracker , called the Meta Pixel , sending Facebook a packet of data whenever a person clicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s appointment . The data is connected to an IP address—an identifier that ’ s like a computer ’ s mailing address and can generally be linked to a specific individual or household—creating an intimate receipt of the appointment request for Facebook . A Third of Top Hospitals ’ Websites Sent Patient Data to Facebook The Markup found 33 of Newsweek ’ s top 100 hospitals in the country sending sensitive data to Facebook via the pixel . Data accurate as of June 15 , 2022 . See full 20-page searchable table at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center , for example , clicking the “ Schedule Online ” button on a doctor ’ s page prompted the Meta Pixel to send Facebook the text of the button , the doctor ’ s name , and the search term we used to find her : “ pregnancy termination. ” Clicking the “ Schedule Online Now ” button for a doctor on the website of Froedtert Hospital , in Wisconsin , prompted the Meta Pixel to send Facebook the text of the button , the doctor ’ s name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dropdown menu : “ Alzheimer ’ s. ” The Markup also found the Meta Pixel installed inside the password-protected patient portals of seven health systems . On five of those systems ’ pages , we documented the pixel sending Facebook data about real patients who volunteered to participate in the Pixel Hunt project , a collaboration between The Markup and Mozilla Rally . The project is a crowd-sourced undertaking in which anyone can install Mozilla ’ s Rally browser add-on in order to send The Markup data on the Meta Pixel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The data sent to hospitals included the names of patients ’ medications , descriptions of their allergic reactions , and details about their upcoming doctor ’ s appointments . Health Systems with Meta Pixels on Their Patient Portals The Markup identified seven health systems that had installed pixels inside their password-protected patient portals . Data accurate as of as of June 15 , 2022 . For active links , visit article at The Markup Former regulators , health data security experts , and privacy advocates who reviewed The Markup ’ s findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) . The law prohibits covered entities like hospitals from sharing personally identifiable health information with third parties like Facebook , except when an individual has expressly consented in advance or under certain contracts . Neither the hospitals nor Meta said they had such contracts in place , and The Markup found no evidence that the hospitals or Meta were otherwise obtaining patients ’ express consent . “ I am deeply troubled by what [ the hospitals ] are doing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , ” said David Holtzman , a health privacy consultant who previously served as a senior privacy adviser in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ’ Office for Civil Rights , which enforces HIPAA . “ I can not say [ sharing this data ] is for certain a HIPAA violation . It is quite likely a HIPAA violation. ” University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center spokesperson George Stamatis did not respond to The Markup ’ s questions but said in a brief statement that the hospital “ comport [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state laws and regulatory requirements. ” After reviewing The Markup ’ s findings , Froedtert Hospital removed the Meta Pixel from its website “ out of an abundance of caution , ” Steve Schooff , a spokesperson for the hospital , wrote in a statement . As of June 15 , six other hospitals had also removed pixels from their appointment booking pages and at least five of the seven health systems that had Meta Pixels installed in their patient portals had removed those pixels . The 33 hospitals The Markup found sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 26 million patient admissions and outpatient visits in 2020 , according to the most recent data available from the American Hospital Association . Our investigation was limited to just over 100 hospitals ; the data sharing likely affects many more patients and institutions than we identified . Facebook itself is not subject to HIPAA , but the experts interviewed for this story expressed concerns about how the advertising giant might use the personal health data it ’ s collecting for its own profit . “ This is an extreme example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tech reach into what we think of as a protected data space , ” said Nicholson Price , a University of Michigan law professor who studies big data and health care . “ I think this is creepy , problematic , and potentially illegal ” from the hospitals ’ point of view . The Markup was unable to determine whether Facebook used the data to target advertisements , train its recommendation algorithms , or profit in other ways . Facebook ’ s parent company , Meta , did not respond to questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief email paraphrasing the company ’ s sensitive health data policy . “ If Meta ’ s signals filtering systems detect that a business is sending potentially sensitive health data from their app or website through their use of Meta Business Tools , which in some cases can happen in error , that potentially sensitive data will be removed before it can be stored in our ads systems , ” Hogan wrote . Meta did not respond to follow-up questions , but Hogan appears to be referencing a sensitive health information filtering system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to a Wall Street Journal article and New York Department of Financial Services investigation . Meta told the investigators that the filtering system was “ not yet operating with complete accuracy , ” according to the department ’ s February 2021 final report . The Markup was unable to confirm whether any of the data referenced in this story was in fact removed before being stored by Meta . However , a recent joint investigation with Reveal found that Meta ’ s sensitive health information filtering system didn ’ t block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis pregnancy centers . Internally , Facebook employees have been blunt about how well—or not so well—the company generally protects sensitive data . “ We do not have an adequate level of control and explainability over how our systems use data , and thus we can ’ t confidently make controlled policy changes or external commitments such as ‘ we will not use X data for Y purpose. ’ ” Facebook engineers on the ad and business product team wrote in a 2021 privacy overview that was leaked to Vice . “ Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meta Pixel is a snippet of code that tracks users as they navigate through a website , logging which pages they visit , which buttons they click , and certain information they enter into forms . It ’ s one of the most prolific tracking tools on the internet—present on more than 30 percent of the most popular sites on the web , according to The Markup ’ s analysis . In exchange for installing its pixel , Meta provides website owners analytics about the ads they ’ ve placed on Facebook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ ve visited their website . The Meta Pixel sends information to Facebook via scripts running in a person ’ s internet browser , so each data packet comes labeled with an IP address that can be used in combination with other data to identify an individual or household . HIPAA lists IP addresses as one of the 18 identifiers that , when linked to information about a person ’ s health conditions , care , or payment , can qualify the data as protected health information . Unlike anonymized or aggregate health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected health information with third parties except under the strict terms of business associate agreements that restrict how the data can be used . In addition , if a patient is logged in to Facebook when they visit a hospital ’ s website where a Meta Pixel is installed , some browsers will attach third-party cookies—another tracking mechanism—that allow Meta to link pixel data to specific Facebook accounts . And in several cases we found—using both dummy accounts created by our reporters and data from Mozilla Rally volunteers—that the Meta Pixel made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Markup clicked the “ Finish Booking ” button on a Scripps Memorial Hospital doctor ’ s page , the pixel sent Facebook not just the name of the doctor and her field of medicine but also the first name , last name , email address , phone number , zip code , and city of residence we entered into the booking form . The Meta Pixel “ hashed ” those personal details—obscuring them through a form of cryptography—before sending them to Facebook . But that hashing doesn ’ t prevent Facebook from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meta explicitly uses the hashed information to link pixel data to Facebook profiles . Using a free online tool , The Markup was also able to reverse most of our hashed test information that the pixel on Scripps Memorial Hospital ’ s website sent to Facebook . Scripps Memorial didn ’ t respond to The Markup ’ s questions but it did remove the Meta Pixel from the final webpages in the appointment booking process after we shared our findings with the hospital . On other hospitals ’ websites , we documented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real patients . When one real patient who participated in the Pixel Hunt study logged in to the MyChart portal for Piedmont Healthcare , a Georgia health system , the Meta Pixel installed in the portal told Facebook the patient ’ s name , the name of their doctor , and the time of their upcoming appointment , according to data collected by the participant ’ s Mozilla Rally browser extension . When another Pixel Hunt participant used the MyChart portal for Novant Health , a North Carolina–based health system , the pixel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient had to a specific medication . The Markup created our own MyChart account through Novant Health to further investigate and found the Meta Pixel collecting a variety of other sensitive information . Clicking on one button prompted the pixel to tell Facebook the name and dosage of a medication in our health record , as well as any notes we had entered about the prescription . The pixel also told Facebook which button we clicked in response to a question about sexual orientation . “ Our Meta pixel placement is guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been removed while we continue to look into this matter , ” Novant spokesperson Megan Rivers wrote in an email . Epic Systems , the software company behind MyChart , has “ specifically recommended heightened caution around the use of custom analytics scripts , ” Stirling Martin , a senior vice president for the company , wrote in an email . Facebook is able to infer intimate details about people ’ s health conditions using other means—for example , the fact that a person “ liked ” a Facebook group associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pixels on hospitals ’ websites is more direct . And in sharing it with Facebook , experts said , health care providers risk damaging patients ’ trust in an increasingly digitized health system . “ Almost any patient would be shocked to find out that Facebook is being provided an easy way to associate their prescriptions with their name , ” said Glenn Cohen , faculty director of Harvard Law School ’ s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy , Biotechnology , and Bioethics . “ Even if perhaps there ’ s something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be lawful , it ’ s totally outside the expectations of what patients think the health privacy laws are doing for them. ” Facebook ’ s data collection on hospital websites has been the subject of class action lawsuits in several states , with mixed results . Those cases involve types of data that health law experts said are sensitive but less regulated than the health information The Markup documented the Meta Pixel collecting . In 2016 , a group of plaintiffs sued Facebook and a handful of health systems and organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own privacy policies and several state and federal laws—including wiretapping and intrusion on seclusion statutes—by collecting data via tracking technology on the health care providers ’ websites . The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed that case in 2017 for a variety of reasons , including that the plaintiffs failed to prove that Facebook had collected “ protected health information , ” as defined by HIPAA . Rather , the court found , Facebook had tracked plaintiffs on public-facing pages of the websites—such as the homepage or informational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the plaintiffs had established a patient relationship with the provider . In 2019 , plaintiffs brought a similar class action lawsuit in Suffolk County Superior Court against Massachusetts-based Partners Healthcare System , which has since changed its name to Mass General Brigham , alleging that the system had violated patients ’ privacy and its own policies by installing the Meta Pixel and other tracking tools on its websites . The parties settled the case in January , with Mass General Brigham denying the allegations and admitting no wrongdoing or liability but paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their attorneys . After the settlement , Mass General Brigham appears to have removed Meta Pixel and other tracking tools from many of its hospitals ’ websites—but not all of them . When The Markup tested the website of Brigham and Women ’ s Faulkner Hospital , clicking the “ Request Appointment ” button on a doctor ’ s page caused the Meta Pixel to send Facebook the text of the button , the doctor ’ s name , and the doctor ’ s field of medicine . Mass General did not respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment . As with all such data we found the Meta Pixel collecting , it was sent to Facebook along with our computer ’ s public IP address . “ When an individual has sought out a provider and indicated that they want to make an appointment , at that point , any individually identifiable health information that they ’ ve provided in this session , in the past , or certainly in the future , is protected under HIPAA and could not be shared with a third party like Facebook , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human Services ’ Office for Civil Rights “ can not comment on open or potential investigations , ” spokesperson Rachel Seeger wrote in an emailed statement . “ Generally , HIPAA covered entities and business associates should not be sharing identifiable information with social media companies unless they have HIPAA authorization [ from the individual ] and consent under state law , ” said Iliana Peters , a privacy lawyer with the firm Polsinelli who previously headed HIPAA enforcement for the Office for Civil Rights . Patients have the right to file HIPAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are required to investigate the complaints , Peters said , adding , “ I would hope that institutions would respond quickly to those types of complaints so that they aren ’ t escalated to a state or federal regulator. ” Most of the hospitals The Markup contacted for this story did not respond to our questions or explain why they chose to install Meta Pixel on their websites . But some did defend their use of the tracker . “ The use of this type of code was vetted , ” wrote Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital , in Chicago . King did not respond to follow-up questions about the vetting process . King said that no protected health information is hosted on or accessible through Northwestern Memorial ’ s website and that “ Facebook automatically recognizes anything that might be close to personal information and does not store this data. ” In fact , Meta explicitly states in its business tools terms of service that the pixel and other trackers do collect personally identifiable information for a variety of purposes . Houston Methodist Hospital , in Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses to The Markup ’ s questions . The hospital began using the pixel in 2017 , spokesperson Stefanie Asin wrote , and is “ confident ” in Facebook ’ s safeguards and that the data being shared isn ’ t protected health information . When The Markup tested Houston Methodist ’ s website , clicking the “ Schedule Appointment ” button on a doctor ’ s page prompted the Meta Pixel to send Facebook the text of the button , the name of the doctor , and the search term we used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion. ” Houston Methodist doesn ’ t categorize that data as protected health information , Asin wrote , because a person who clicks the “ Schedule Appointment ” button may not follow through and confirm the appointment , or , they may be booking the appointment for a family member rather than for themself . “ The click doesn ’ t mean they scheduled , ” she wrote . “ It ’ s also worth noting that people often are exploring for a spouse , friend , elderly parent. ” Asin added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to detect and reject any health information , providing a barrier that prevents passage of [ protected health information ] . ” Despite defending its use of the Meta Pixel , Houston Methodist Hospital removed the pixel from its website several days after responding to The Markup ’ s questions . “ Since our further examination of the topic is ongoing , we elected to remove the pixel for now to be sure we are doing everything we can to protect our patients ’ privacy while we are evaluating , ” Asin wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not launch its sensitive health data filtering system until July 2020 , three years after Houston Methodist began using the pixel , according to the New York Department of Financial Services ’ investigation . And as recently as February of last year , the department reported that the system ’ s accuracy was poor . That type of Band-Aid fix is a prime example , privacy advocates say , of the online advertising industry ’ s inability to police itself . “ The evil genius of Facebook ’ s system is they create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snooping for them and then they just put it out into the universe and Facebook can try to claim plausible deniability , ” said Alan Butler , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center . “ The fact that this is out there in the wild on the websites of hospitals is evidence of how broken the rules are. ” This article was copublished with STAT , a national publication that delivers trusted and authoritative journalism about health , medicine , and the life sciences .

""""""" Arguably the world ’ s most popular private search engine , DuckDuckGo , has long been a haven for those who do not want to participate in Google ’ s censorship , manipulation , and tracking . In 2008 , Gabriel Weinberg stared this mission with an emphasis on protecting searchers ’ privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalized search results that comes with all things Google . Since its inception , the pro-privacy and anti-tracking business model has propelled the company from just a couple hundred thousand searches a month to over 100,000,000 searches every day . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all may be changing now . This week , Weinberg , took everything his organization had been working on for years , and flushed it down the toilet with a single tweet . While this may seem like a noble gesture , as the Russian invasion of Ukraine is an unlawful and horrific invasion , the idea of a search engine which prides itself as anti-censorship and pro-privacy turning to the dark side and hiding information from its users , is not appealing to those who actually stand by these principles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly constitutes “ disinformation ? ” In his thread , in which he engaged with several users , Weinberg said nothing of transparency . Nor did he elaborate on what is and what isn ’ t disinformation or who would be telling DuckDuckGo what to censor . If anything the last two years , and especially the last three weeks , have shown us that today ’ s disinformation is the next day ’ s reality and vice versa . So many stories have been called disinformation only to be proven true months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overt disinformation has been presented as fact only to be proven false down the road . Case in point : Snake Island and the Ghost of Kyiv . The Ghost of Kyiv story was an inspiring tale of a single Ukrainian fighter pilot who took out multiple Russian aircraft . It was pushed by the president and multiple officials from Ukraine . The only thing was , it was fake , or rather “ disinformation ” as Weinberg would say . As the NY Times reported , while there are reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat , there is no information linking them to a single Ukrainian pilot . One of the first videos that went viral , which was included in the montage shared by the official Ukraine Twitter account , was a computer rendering from a combat flight simulator originally uploaded by a YouTube user with just 3,000 subscribers . And a photo supposedly confirming the fighter ’ s existence , shared by a former president of Ukraine , Petro Poroshenko , was from a 2019 Twitter post by the Ukrainian defense ministry . “ Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” said Laura Edelson , a computer scientist studying misinformation at New York University . “ They are telling stories that support their narrative . Sometimes false information is making its way in there , too , and more of it is getting through because of the overall environment. ” Even Snopes , who loves to spin “ fact checks ” to paint their political enemies in a negative light , was forced to report on this incident . However , in true Snopes fashion , they refused to label it “ false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — that was a computer simulation and put out by the Ukrainian government to intentionally deceive — was merely “ miscaptioned. ” There was also the story of Snake Island , in which President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine personally announced the deaths of soldiers allegedly killed by Russian troops , only to announce later that no such attack happened and all the men who were “ killed , ” were actually alive . Make no mistake , Russia is also involved in a heavy propaganda campaign . They have been caught lying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have also been caught stoking multiple fears of “ false flags ” which never happened and were used as a pretext to invade Ukraine . Misinformation and disinformation have long been tools in both starting and during conflicts . Americans should know this the most , as we ’ ve been led in to multiple wars based on lies started by politicians and echoed by mainstream media . Remember Iraqi troops throwing babies on the ground — a premise to justify the beginning of the Gulf War — which never actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction , the Gulf of Tonkin , or Bashar al-Assad gassing his own people ? This disinformation led to the suffering and deaths of millions of innocent people and the folks who spread it are the main voices behind a new era of censorship . Unfortunately , many folks don ’ t care that they are being lied to – in fact , they want it . “ Why can ’ t we just let people believe some things ? ” one Twitter user replied in the Ghost of Kyiv thread , receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians believe it , it brings fear . If the Ukrainians believe it , it gives them hope. ” Even the NY Times weighed in and said that Ukraine needs these lies to “ keep morale high among the fighters and marshal global support for their cause. ” While morale is certainly important to keeping troops engaged in battle , what happens when the truth comes out ? What happens to morale when thousands of “ troops , ” including yours truly , invade a country or carry out an act based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lied to ? It devastates you , that ’ s what happens . So , while Weinberg may think he is on the righteous path by limiting search results which favor a particular side in this conflict , this will only lead to more ignorance , more close-mindedness , and more suffering . Censorship never has and never will be used by anyone other than authoritarian regimes . It has never worked and never will work to create anything but ignorance and faith in tyrants . It reflects society ’ s lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stepping stone on the path to totalitarianism .

The Guardian says the building was packed with people injured by previous air strikes, and others seeking shelter from Israel's bombardment. According to the Times, the strike was caught on camera and sent blast waves through the hospital forecourt. It's among several papers to note that it's the deadliest such incident in the history of conflict between Israel and its neighbours. The front page of the Daily Mirror says the Middle East crisis is spiralling, with the headline ""This Must End"". ""Who is to blame?"" asks the Daily Mail as it highlights both Israel - and what the paper calls 'Gaza militants' - offering competing explanations for the blast."

""""""" Citigroup has just become the first Wall Street megabank to give the anti-vaxxers among its 70K employees an ultimatum : either get vaccinated ( and turn over the appropriate proper documentation ) , or find somewhere else to work . As Wall Street banks struggle to find a strategy to bring workers back to the office without putting them at risk of getting COVID , the bank has decided that Citi employees who do n't comply with this mandate by Jan. 14 will be placed on unpaid leave , and their last day of employment will come at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message to Citigroup staff seen by Bloomberg . This is by far the most restrictive requirement among Wall Street firms . But whether or not it will help the financial services industry bring workers back to the office more quickly remains to be seen . On top of this , Citi is holding bonus payments over workers ' heads , saying that any employees who refuse the vaccine also wo n't receive bonus payments for 2021 unless they sign a legal document giving up their right to sue Citigroup , presumably for wrongful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandates is still being chewed over by SCOTUS . Workers who are forced out by the vaccination policy can apply for other jobs at Citi in the future , but they should n't bother if they do n't `` see the light '' and get vaccinated . According to Bloomberg , more than 90 % of Citigroup ’ s staffers in the US have already been vaccinated . Any workers who have n't gotten their shots are welcome to apply for religious or medical exemptions . Although it 's not clear what those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period between the start of the vaccine mandate , and whenever Citi finishes analyzing all the applications for an exemption . Unsurprisingly , Citi is already facing public backlash for its decision to push out anti-vaxxers . One Twitter user questioned if Citi would take responsibility for any vaccine-induced medical issues ( like the 'almost harmless ' inflammation of the heart that has been associated with mRNA vaccines and younger users ) . And what 's next ? Will Citibank extend this mandate to its vaccinated customers ? One Citi worker complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge `` overreach '' since most of his direct reports do n't work in the same state as him . `` I ’ ve been sitting at home for two years now , I rarely go to the office , my direct reports are states away -- this felt like a huge overreach , '' said George Pagano , who spent five years in Citigroup ’ s operations and technology division before departing in November due to the mandate . `` When it comes to promoting the company at the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week after Christmas , it just seemed to be a bit too much . '' Finally , Citi is imposing its mandate as constitutionality of vaccine mandates is still debatable . As one source told Bloomberg , most companies are waiting to see how SCOTUS rules . While Citi 's office workers must adhere to the Jan. 14 deadline , workers in the company 's office branches will have a little more leeway . To try and make the mandate more palatable , Citi has taken measures including bringing in medical experts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human-resources leaders and handing out prizes for vaccinated workers . It also offered paid time off for workers hoping to get the shot . Earlier this week , Goldman Sachs became the latest Wall Street megabank to abandon its plans to return employees to its offices . Citi has already faced legal challenges over its vaccine mandate , which it first announced back in November after President Biden called on corporations to coerce their workers into getting the jabs . Of course , the rate of vaccination will differ dramatically by state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already facing pressure from the government to get the vaccines , while workers in Florida and Texas have been afforded much more leniency . Unfortunately , the world has learned over the last year that the vaccines are n't nearly as effective as Pfizer and Moderna ( and President Biden ) originally led the public to believe . So hopefully whoever came up with this idea at Citi is n't disappointed when it has no impact on the number of workers afflicted by virus . """""""

"The next Speaker of the House? Photo: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images It’s common for one party to control the House while the other controls the Senate, and this often leads to federal government dysfunction. But the partisan gridlock is particularly bad at the moment. It’s not just that Democrats control the Senate and the White House while Republicans control the House. The problem is that the House GOP is divided between those who recognize that divided government requires compromise and those who would happily trigger national debt defaults (which we narrowly avoided in early June) and government shutdowns (which is almost certain to happen at the end of September) while attacking their more responsible colleagues as RINOs. The good news is that the oddsmakers have believed for a while now that the House is likely to turn blue in 2024, as Roll Call’s Stu Rothenberg explained back in January:"

The Communist Party of Finland (SKP) and its youth group Kommunistinuoret were among the groups that protested the government’s bid to ban communist symbols by equating them with Nazi symbols.

He’s being vetted over how he made his millions at the biotech company he started in his late 20s and frequent shifts in his foreign policy platform. He’s also facing questions about how he would, if elected, enact his agenda and defend it from legal challenges. One of the latest moments to illustrate this came last week when, a few days after a dinner with social media personality Jake Paul, he became the first of the major GOP primary candidates to join TikTok in an effort to appeal to younger voters, despite his concerns. Up until that point, he had railed against TikTok, calling it an addictive “digital fentanyl” and expressing an openness to ban it as part of his broader platform on curbing China’s power."

""""""" Ah , well , that was close ! The Republican Senate primary in Ohio attracted national attention because so many of its participants kept behaving abominably . To a large extent that was thanks to the antics of perennial Ohio candidate Josh Mandel , who—spoiler—did not win . But it was also to a large extent because of J.D . Vance . Vance , in addition to being the author of the hit memoir Hillbilly Elegy , is a multimillionaire investor in tech startups whose personal associations are such that he once hosted a fundraiser for a private school on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion-industry CEO Les Wexner , who is known for his longtime professional and financial relationship with Jeffrey Epstein . ( Wexner has never been accused of involvement in sexual abuse . ) Vance ’ s campaign was backed by a super PAC supported by $ 15 million in donations from Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel , for whom Vance once worked . That is , according to Politico , the most ever given to support a single Senate candidate . Thiel , for his part , is known for having reportedly expressed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with younger people ’ s blood , as well as for suing Gawker.com out of existence because he didn ’ t like its coverage of him . Somehow , within this set of facts , Vance ran on the premise that someone ought to stick it to wealthy “ elites , ” particularly technology executives , because they are decadent creeps who are suppressing free speech and have reshaped the economy in a way that screws the working class . ( He even , in a since-deleted tweet defending the plausibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epstein ’ s name . ) He also argued the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump via “ large-scale ” voter fraud , apologized for having criticized Trump in the past , suggested Democrats are encouraging illegal immigration in order to “ replace ” existing Americans , and held a campaign event with Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene not long after she spoke at a white-power conference whose organizer ’ s own speech included an appreciative aside about Hitler . Then there was Matt Dolan . Dolan , a state senator whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cleveland Guardians baseball team , tried to run as someone who , despite being conservative , does not think the 2020 election was stolen or that Trump is an admirable person . Dolan appeared to be aware that this was a long shot . When I wrote about a candidate forum in November , the audience and the other candidates were so dismissive and contemptuous of Dolan that I wondered if he was running to fulfill some sort of contractual obligation related to his inheritance , like Billy Madison . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer about COVID with the observation that schools should protect children . Late in the campaign , though , Dolan ’ s strategy of being somewhat normal and concerned about issues that exist in observable reality , like gas prices , broke through . He began polling close enough to Vance ( and Mandel ) that it seemed possible he ’ d sneak through and win . Nope ! Vance had also jumped in the polls after receiving Trump ’ s endorsement in mid-April , and won the race on Tuesday . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 percent to Mandel ’ s 24 percent and Dolan ’ s 23 percent . Trump was long known to be considering an endorsement of Mandel as well . According to a report in Rolling Stone , however , he was convinced to back Vance in part because of a phone call in which Fox News host Tucker Carlson initiated a conversation about a rumor that Mandel ’ s biggest outside supporter—the president of the Club for Growth organization—has a weird penis . For real : “ The twice-impeached former president spent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the prominent Republican ’ s penis and how ‘ fucking disgusting ’ and ‘ fucking gross ’ he allegedly was , ” the magazine wrote . ( On Twitter , the individual in question denied having a weird penis . ) Trump also attacked Dolan because his family had changed the name of its baseball franchise from the Indians to the Guardians and eliminated the team ’ s red-faced cartoon mascot , “ Chief Wahoo. ” In a statement released last week , Trump said the decision to change the name suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States Senate. ” Vance had previously made similar comments . So , those guys won and Dolan lost ; traditional small-business conservatism appears to be dead in the state that basically invented it . The Democrats ’ nominee to run against Vance is avowedly working-class Rep. Tim Ryan , who ’ s already at work portraying Vance as a carpetbagging rich phony , but he ’ ll be fighting uphill against a MAGA movement whose leader just demonstrated his continuing relevance . As J.D . Vance might say at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public ( anymore ) , c ’ est la vie ! """""""

"THIS MAY SEEM like a rather fanciful time to argue that cooperation is a realistic solution to life’s problems. There are spiraling rivalries both within and between nations, not to mention that much of our life is structured as a ruthless winner-take-all competition. But in his new book Cooperation: A Political, Economic, and Social Theory, legal scholar and critical theorist Bernard Harcourt sets out to make precisely that case. According to him, a new cooperative paradigm imbued with the core values of participation, equity, and sustainability is not only desirable, but also eminently realizable.Harcourt’s analysis rests on a few interlocking propositions. First, that the competitive models of politics, society, and economy that we live with today are antiquated. They were developed when the world was less interdependent and therefore less in need of radical transformation to avert imminent catastrophes. Second, that instead of breaking with these models, we have become stagnant in our thinking, locked in a pointless tug-of-war between a social democratic state-based model and a conservative market-based model.The third point, to which the bulk of the book is dedicated, is a positive argument that cooperation can break this stalemate without needing a massive revolution. That’s because cooperation is something that we do all the time, and not only in our personal lives. As Harcourt points out at great length, different forms of cooperative enterprises—from international mutual insurance companies to flour makers in Vermont to behemoth cooperations in Catalonia—are already flourishing, and they have a proven track record of delivering quality goods and services in a way that respects both workers and the environment.Harcourt suggests that simply by engaging in cooperative practices, we can create a “snowball” effect, propelling cooperation into the mainstream of economic life. Indeed, he does not stop there: he wants to see the snowball of cooperation overtake all aspects of how we live, including by increasing democracy and, perhaps most radically, by leading us beyond the very idea of punishment.Harcourt’s ideas are clearly presented. He writes in a straightforward prose that, while rigorously researched, is easily understandable, even as he ranges across diverse fields. He gives clear examples of how cooperative work can be scaled up. He notes, for instance, that in the United States, the tax code currently favors personal equity gains over cooperative disbursements because the former are charged at the lower, capital gains tax, while the latter are treated as taxable income. This is the kind of legal change that could in theory bring together small business–minded conservatives with worker-minded liberals, without too much disagreement.A possibly more contentious part of Harcourt’s argument is that a cooperative economy should replace both capitalism and communism as economic models. That argument begins with the claim that these have both been misconceived as directed by either market forces or communal forces. Rather, he argues that both are better understood as forms of “‘dirigisme,’ a mode of economic organization in which a centralized body plays a dominant directive role.” Whether it is wealthy elites or party elites, control is always top-down. The only things centralized in his cooperative model are the values of equality, participation, and sustainability. How we get there is viewed as an open-ended task of learning and experimentation.The history of cooperative experimentation is not itself without need of learning from mistakes. Harcourt notes that while there are positive historical examples of cooperatives, especially in African American history, what we get from the 19th century in Europe are many cooperative ideas with uncooperative origins. Like many forms of community-making, they often explicitly banned people (Jews and women most explicitly) from joining.Although it may then still make sense to draw inspiration from some figures of the past, Harcourt thinks we are better off developing a new theory (called “coöperism” throughout the book) for cooperation today. This theory has “three core principles: it is concentrated and compounded; it is deliberate and chosen; it is open and inclusive.” Not all forms of cooperation, after all, are equally true to the goals of equality, participation, and sustainability. While, for example, the outdoor-gear store REI is a consumer cooperative that rewards its members, it has also fought worker unionization. The goal of concentrating and compounding is to put cooperative ideals at the heart of everything we do. And we do this, according to Harcourt, not because of some evolutionary impulse to group formation, but because we have deliberately chosen inclusive cooperation as the best means of expressing our shared values.One of the most powerful parts of the book comes in the chapter on the social consequences of cooperation, where Harcourt argues skillfully that a truly cooperative society would sever the link between crime and punishment to strive toward a more holistic understanding of human failures and develop ways to work together to avoid or redress them. While much of the rest of the book is largely standard in the literature on cooperation, Harcourt’s link to new paradigms of justice is original. He shows that the power of cooperation is not only in how it may transform democratic participation or the economy, but also in how we conceive of the very meaning and purpose of life.There are some legitimate questions to be raised about Harcourt’s model from various positions. His penultimate chapter is dedicated to responding to anticipated criticisms from both the Left and the Right. Responding to the Right, he argues against the logic that markets naturally create the most wealth. Building on his earlier work in The Illusion of Free Markets: Punishment and the Myth of Natural Order (2011) as well as Katharina Pistor’s trenchant argument that the law functions as a code to promote certain kinds of capital growth, Harcourt demonstrates that all economic systems require state and legal organization to function. As such, the question is not what grows the economy but how the economy grows. Harcourt may not convince many on the neoliberal right, but at least he makes a clear case for why they—and not proponents of cooperative economies—should be on the defense.Harcourt anticipates that the Left’s main criticism will be that cooperatives seem to undercut the need for class struggle. While his argument against the Right is that they naturalize current conditions, this logic creeps into his own diagnosis of class struggle as he argues that the current decline of left-wing parties and unionization shows that there is not much hope through these venues. This seems to hypostatize the present in a way he avoids elsewhere. And given how popular worker-owned enterprises are among leftist economists, including Marxian ones like Richard Wolff, I am not sure how widespread this criticism actually would be. It seems mostly to be about those who would put the revolution first. Harcourt insists that we need not have a revolution to begin making cooperatives. We can, and should, begin to do so now.When it comes to the abolition of punishment, however, Harcourt himself is revolutionary. In response to possible critics, he recognizes that he may be an outlier here, as he even has to politely reject the idea of “nonreformist reforms”—reforms that move toward abolition—advanced by thinkers like Ruth Wilson Gilmore and Mariame Kaba. The “snowball” effect expected in other realms seems to have melted here. The upshot is that it leads to a deeper acknowledgment of the troubles any cooperative form will face.One should equally remember that efforts at cooperative worker ownership have often had to struggle, lose, and rebuild from their losses. As Gar Alperovitz (a leading thinker about cooperative economies who is surprisingly absent from the book) has explored at length, one of the most important modern attempts at worker ownership happened in 1977 in Youngstown, Ohio, when the community and workers tried to purchase a recently shuttered steel mill. They faced opposition from big capital and big unions, and their immediate struggle failed. Yet they inspired decades of worker-owned operations in Ohio that have become world-leading models. One of Harcourt’s key points is that we can and should begin cooperative action now, in whatever context we find ourselves. Considering his own context, I had to wonder why he did not include a detailed analysis of contemporary universities and how cooperatives may play a role in transforming their notoriously uneven structures. Given the prominent role that elite institutions have played in fostering inequality, and given how vastly unequal the pay is within universities, the transformation of the university should take a more prominent role in any vision of a future cooperative society.Ultimately, though, these are less criticisms of the argument than a desire to see it pushed further and deeper into society, and with a more open-eyed awareness of the struggles that cooperative transformation may face. Indeed, while much of Harcourt’s argument on politics and economics can be found elsewhere, what makes his contribution unique and inspiring is precisely that he applies it to other facets of our social life, especially with the ideal of ending the punitive model of society. He joins many others in reminding us that we need not wait for society as a whole to realize a new cooperative vision; we can just cooperate at whatever level we can. And we can start that today, even knowing full well how difficult our transformation will be. ¤"
"The company in charge of the Democratic Party’s prized campaign technology tools announced its second round of layoffs in just under a year on September 6, slashing a total of nearly 350 jobs this year just as the 2024 elections ramp up. In recent years, the privately owned monopoly over the Democratic Party’s voter data has changed hands from one for-profit company to another. Apax Partners, a global private equity firm, currently owns EveryAction and NGP VAN, the firms that house the Democrats’ suite of voter file, compliance, and organizing tools. Apax acquired them from another private equity firm in 2021, creating a new merged entity called Bonterra. Last month, according to current and former employees, Bonterra cut at least 20 percent of its staff, more than 200 employees. Staff members across EveryAction and NGP VAN, which hold the Democratic Party’s most sensitive data, were cut. At least a quarter of the people laid off belonged to the union, 51 of them unit members from EveryAction and NGP VAN. At least half of the developers at ActionKit, a fundraising and customer relations management software acquired by EveryAction in 2019, lost their jobs.

Make sense of the news fast with Opinions' daily newsletter ArrowRight The obvious threat to democracy comes from Donald Trump, yet he is often treated as a normal, if much-indicted, presidential candidate. So it was important for Biden to call the former president out, repeatedly and forcefully, for his open promises, as Biden put it, to rule “with no limits on [his] power” in the name of “vengeance and vindictiveness.” But democracy is also in trouble because of dysfunctions created by the insistence of a far-right minority to rule at all costs. The extremists’ contempt for the wishes of the majority explains why they revere Trump’s eagerness to subvert free elections and why they were willing to burden military personnel and civil servants with the cost of a shutdown."

In the Senate, Mitt Romney announced his plan to retire, having declared to his biographer that “a very large portion of my party really doesn’t believe in the Constitution.” In Wisconsin and North Carolina, G.O.P. legislators push the envelope of hardball tactics to remove or disempower Democrats in other branches of government. And in the presidential campaign, Republican contenders struggle to make the case for a non-Trump candidacy without antagonizing Donald Trump’s many supporters, and often avoid major spheres of public policy. Together these depict a party that is preoccupied with antics that crash into the guardrails of American political life and conspicuously lacks a coherent, forward-looking vision for governing.

The nonprofit has argued—and won—several Supreme Court cases establishing religious exemptions from civil rights laws , most famously Masterpiece Cakeshop v.

After all , the water needs to freeze before it hits the ground . You could say that machine-made snow is flash-frozen instead of naturally grown in the atmosphere .

The 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid was the first to use snow machines , but more recent Games have been especially reliant on them . Eighty percent of the snow at the unseasonably warm Sochi games and 90 percent of Pyeongchang ’ s snow came from machines . All that snow comes at a huge monetary and environmental cost . China estimated the Winter Olympics will need about 49 million gallons of water to make its snow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games will need 10 times that amount . While Chinese officials have pledged to reuse the meltwater once the Olympics end , a study found that up to 40 percent of water used for snow-making is lost to evaporation . Artificial snow runs have also been shown to erode soil and decrease vegetation on mountains . A report from the International Olympic Committee said Chinese officials had “ underestimated the amount of water that would be needed for snowmaking for the Games ” and “ overestimated the ability to recapture water used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what will happen to the Winter Olympics venues once the Games are over . “ That ’ s actually the question I ’ m most interested in , ” said Timothy Kellison , director of the Center for Sport and Urban Policy at Georgia State University and co-author of a recent report titled “ Slippery Slopes : How Climate Change Is Threatening the 2022 Winter Olympics. ” “ One of the things that made Beijing attractive to the IOC is that it had committed to growing winter sports in China. ” In 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roadmap to increase winter sports participation in the country from 12 million people to more than 300 million by 2022 , a goal that China said it reached this January . But a rising demand for snow in places where it rarely falls could be , well , a slippery slope . Similar challenges could also trickle down to recreational skiing and snowboarding sites around the world . “ People schedule entire vacations around the ability to go on a ski trip , and it ’ s becoming more and more challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murfree , a visiting assistant professor in Texas A & M ’ s sport management department and member of the Sport Ecology Group . Ski resorts around the United States and Europe , Murfree explained , are increasingly turning to artificial snow to coat their mountains with snow and maintain the illusion of a winter wonderland . “ One of the things we can do to preserve the sport is to provide artificial snow . Because these sports are so important to us , we ’ re going to find a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ re going to fake it till we make it. ” Snow machines could also worsen the very problem — climate change — that has contributed to their popularity . They guzzle a huge amount of power , consuming about half of a typical ski resort ’ s energy costs . While China has committed to powering all of the snow machines at the Winter Olympics with renewable energy , many ski resorts can ’ t or won ’ t choose clean power ( though some are trying , even going so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure their resorts run on clean power ) . Powering snow machines with electricity from fossil fuels will spew greenhouse gas into the air . This will warm the planet and increase the demand for snow machines , continuing the cycle . “ We don ’ t talk very much about how the use of artificial snow could be unfair , ” added Murfree . Winter sports aren ’ t cheap , and as ski resorts lose precious time to unseasonable weather and invest more in snow-making operations , they may raise prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make snow sports , which already have a reputation for elitism , even more unequal . “ When we sit down at night to watch the Olympic Games , we have this great picture of snowy slopes , ” Murfree said . “ When the camera zooms out , we see trees with no snow on both sides of the slope . That should raise more questions . We get so caught up in the conditions of artificial snow that we don ’ t really zoom out and see the whole picture . @ """""""

""""""" In Carl Trueman ’ s Strange New World ( a condensed version of his illuminating The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self ) , he warns against the temptation to narrowly focus on the specific issues of the day to the point where we lose sight of the big picture : One of the temptations at a time of tremendous flux and change is to fixate upon the immediate challenges to the Christian faith . Now , it is surely not a bad thing to prioritize the most pressing problems the church faces and address them with a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , was a major problem in 1517 , and it was right for Luther to focus on that , rather than spend his time writing on the issue of same-sex marriage , a matter of no import whatsoever in the early sixteenth century . Yet there is a danger here : we can become so preoccupied with specific threats that we neglect the important fact that Christian truth is not a set of isolated and unconnected claims but rather stands as a coherent whole . The church ’ s teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a function of her teaching on what it means to be human . The doctrines of creation , fall , redemption , and consummation are important foundations for addressing the specific challenges of our time . If , as I have argued in this book , modern sexual and identity politics are functions of deeper notions of selfhood , then we need first to know what the Christian view of the self is in order to address them . And as the Bible teaches that the human self is made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good grasp of the doctrine of God . In short , we can stand strong at this cultural moment and address the specific challenges we face only if our foundations in God ’ s truth are broad and deep . [ Emphasis added . ] The key point here is this : “ Christian truth is not a set of isolated and unconnected claims but rather stands as a coherent whole ” ( a point Greg Koukl makes so well in The Story of Reality ) . Without an understanding of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , and when the parts don ’ t make sense , why not simply jettison them one by one when they become a nuisance ? Sadly , if Ligonier ’ s recent study on “ The State of Theology ” in America is any indication , this jettisoning of essential parts of Christianity is well underway , with 38 % of evangelicals agreeing that “ religious belief is a matter of personal opinion ; it is not about objective truth , ” 43 % agreeing Jesus was not God , and 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is born innocent in the eyes of God. ” It ’ s clear something has gone seriously wrong in the American church . I suspect there are many reasons for this , but however we got here , now is the time for us to pick up the pieces of our fellow Christians ’ crumbling foundation and help them fit those pieces back together into a beautiful , meaningful whole . The Parts Connect to Make a Meaningful Whole So , what should we do as Christian apologists , teachers , and mentors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of service , to the building up of the body of Christ ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a mature man , to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ ” ( Eph . 4:12–13 ) ? First , keep in mind what , according to that Ephesians passage , is most important : maturity in the knowledge of the Son of God — something that requires well-rounded knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working out of that knowledge in our lives ( 2 Pet . 1:2–11 ) , empowered by the work of the Holy Spirit . Pressing issues in the culture , while important , are secondary to this . While those controversial issues entail branches that grow naturally from the root , it ’ s the root that must first be planted , established , and nurtured . The branches depend on the root , not the other way around . When the branches are dying , that ’ s a clear indication the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prune the branches , but don ’ t prune them at the expense of nourishing the root . Second , when facing any cultural issue , follow it down to that foundational root so you know what larger idea needs to be addressed .

Going even deeper , our understanding of what a human being is and how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not we were created by God and even whether or not God exists . Seek to understand , and then help the people around you to understand , the big picture — how the parts are connected to each other in a meaningful whole .

"Casper, Wyo. (Wyoming News Now) - We first told you about a website called WyoRino a couple of weeks ago. It’s a website that calls out certain Republicans for not being conservative enough. The Natrona County Republican Party held an event last week, in which they invited the person or people who run the website. Six state senators and representatives, from across the state, who have been called out on wyorino.com were in attendance at the Natrona County Republican Party event. Representative Barry Crago has been one of those targeted by the website. He explains what the website does. “The website rates you based on ten particular votes. Those votes, they claim, are either conservative or not, based on how they view the bill. And so, obviously, if you don’t vote how they want you to vote, or how they think you should have voted, then they give you a score on that.” The person or persons who run the website were invited to be guests of honor, but they didn’t show. One attendee, Dan Sabrosky, explains why he attended... And it may not be why you think. “It’s no secret that there’s a huge divide in the Republican party. Especially here in Natrona County. So curiosity, more than anything, is what brought me here.”"

"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, looking powerless. Photo: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images When partisan control of Washington is divided there is often a risk of government shutdown at the end of the federal fiscal year (September 30). Sometimes shutdown scares are just that: a wake-up call to feuding or procrastinating lawmakers to finish enacting appropriations before the money runs out and nonessential government functions close. Frequently “stopgap” short-term funding measures are passed to provide more time to cut deals. And typically most appropriations are finalized as part of big “omnibus” bills with hundreds of little deals and non-germane policy amendments embedded. It’s the ultimate sausage-making enterprise made messier when the two major parties are waging symbolic battles on a broad front, as they most definitely are right now. Twelve days before fiscal year 2023 ends, the odds of a shutdown are very high, and this one could last a while (of the ten government shutdowns since 1980, six lasted no more than three days). Divided party control of Washington is only one factor. The bigger problem is confined to the narrowly Republican-controlled House, where Speaker Kevin McCarthy is perpetually being held hostage by hard-core conservatives who have the power to take away his gavel via a motion-to-vacate-the-chair maneuver (a device McCarthy was forced to sanction in order to win his initial election as Speaker). With both alleged “runway spending” and alleged McCarthy/RINO coziness with Democrats being huge causes célèbres on the far right, the Speaker’s four-vote majority dooms him to a perpetual choice between losing his position and behaving irresponsibly."

"(JTA) — The Facebook post in early August condemning antisemitic flyers left around Raleigh might not have been surprising, coming from North Carolina’s lieutenant governor. But for Lieutenant Gov. Mark Robinson, the statement marked something of a change in tone. After the Republican was elected to the state’s second-highest office in 2020, revelations emerged that he was the prolific author of Facebook posts downplaying the threat of Nazism, invoking antisemitic stereotypes and targeting other minority groups. At the time, Robinson’s track record earned him criticism from local Jewish leaders and national commentators; the Republican Jewish Coalition called his comments “clearly antisemitic.” In response, Robinson did not publicly apologize for the posts but he said he would no longer make them. He met with a group of local Jewish leaders in 2021 and says he privately apologized to them."

The United States Government does not challenge that position .

These U.S. Government war-mongering efforts have , by now , succeeded overwhelmingly among the residents of Taiwan . Consequently , on 29 March 2005 , Taiwan issued “ The Official Position of the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) on the People ’ s Republic of China ’ s Anti-Secession ( Anti-Separation ) Law ” , and publicly announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejects that Chinese law , because “ the Law proclaims that ‘ Taiwan is a part of China ’ . ” U.S. President Harry S. Truman had created the CIA in 1947 to perpetrate coups and other regime-changes so that the U.S. Government could take control of the world without necessarily using its armed forces for its conquests ( doing it more by subversion , and by hiring mercenaries , and bribing generals ) . Their first coup was in 1948 Thailand ( then called “ Burma ” ) in order to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribes and “ Special Operations ” including future coups , and this first coup relied upon the fascist ( or “ Might makes right ” ) Guomindang ( GMD ) or Kuomintang ( KMT ) forces , who had fled from Mao ’ s victorious anti-Japanese forces in mainland China , onto China ’ s island of Formosa ( whose Japanese rulers welcomed China ’ s fascists ) and formed there the “ Republic of China , ” as an American protectorate . The KMT also had an army that had fled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIA to overthrow and replace Burma ’ s Government in 1948 so as to establish the CIA ’ s funding stream from the international opium-traffic , which , at that time , was centered in Burma . Consequently , the CIA partnered with the KMT at the very of the CIA .

That policy has been very successful toward conquering China , but only gradually , and it is now being brought to the boiling point . If Taiwan makes any attempt to declare publicly that it is a part of China , then China will invade it , in order to enforce what they have always consistently asserted about Taiwan ( that it is ) . And , then , the U.S. Government will say that China ’ s invasion is not “ a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against China , and will blame China ’ s Government , for this war that the U.S. Government has actually been preparing ( setting up ) for decades . Starting only late in the 20th Century did the U.S. Government begin to press more firmly to break off Taiwan from China . Consequently , Taiwan ’ s National Chengchi University instituted in 1994 annual polling on a number of policy-options regarding the way forward regarding Taiwan ’ s status . At that time , the most popular option , supported by 38.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status quo , decide at later date. ” A different policy-option , “ Maintain status quo , move toward independence , ” was supported by only 8.0 % . However , as-of June 2022 , those two percentages have become virtually tied at around 28.5 % for each , which are thus now tied as being the top two policy-choices . So , apparently , this the time to strike . Perhaps Pelosi is hoping to move the needle a bit more America ’ s way by flying into Taiwan now , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against China , on the part both of Taiwan and America . It would bond Americans and Taiwanese to the same fate . And a U.S. military victory against China would do much for Democrats ’ fortunes in this year ’ s off-elections . ( By contrast , a U.S. wouldn ’ t much change the two Parties ’ political prospects , because Party could then be about ‘ our victory ’ . ) On July 29th , the Republican U.S . Senator Marsha Blackburn headlined “ Blackburn , Colleagues Introduce Legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced : U.S .

Perhaps this will turn out to be the pay-off time , after all those decades of subversion , bribery , etc . It seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Government is now more determined than ever to establish China as being yet another colony , or ‘ ally ’ , and nothing would reassert U.S. global hegemony more than breaking off a piece of China would . It ’ d be the strongest assertion yet , of the U.S. Government ’ s “ rules-based international order , ” in which the U.S. Government makes the international “ rules , ” instead of the U.N. making the international “ laws. ” That ’ s what is really the point of all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encompass every nation , eliminate all “ competition. ” America ’ s Government has been preparing for such an opportunity , ever since , really , 25 July 1945 . This could be the biggest pay-off , yet , from it , if it happens . But taking this path could also spark WW III . The U.S. public seem to accept that risk — not WW III to keep , but WW III to win .

As regards the island ’ s , and the key question , of whether the allegation is true “ that ‘ Taiwan is a part of China ’ , ” here ’ s a summary about this history : Taiwan ( Formosa ) was started when the Japanese Empire was forced to give up control over the Chinese island Formosa . Truman backed the fascist Guomindang ( GMD ) or Kuomintang ( KMT ) forces who had fled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainland China , onto China ’ s island of Formosa and formed there the “ Republic of China , ” as being an American protectorate . It subsequently came to be called “ Taiwan ” ( which even Japanese historians acknowledge to be a Chinese name for the island ) but called officially the “ Republic of China , ’ and the “ Republic of Taiwan. ” So ; by the o of anyone who that it is a of and is “ ” is simply , and , lying , because ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. side ( now the Japanese side as the -WW-II , fascist , overlords of Taiwan ) had the civil war in China , but , ever since , the U.S. Government has been , who holed-up in what is actually China ’ s province of Formosa or Taiwan . If and when China finally takes back control of it , the place-name might revert to “ Formosa , ” or to “ the Province of Formosa , ” so as to that China , Japan , won WW II . None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred , at all , if FDR instead of Truman had been America ’ s President WW II . Truman was a fascist-imperialist , but FDR was intensely AGAINST both fascism and imperialism . Anti-communism was merely the that the post-WW-II fascist imperialists gave , for their fascist imperialism ( America ’ s coups , invasions , subversions , etc. , to conquer the world ) , so as to fool their publics into believing they live in a ‘ democracy ’ . If there will be a WW III , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDR ’ s foreign policies , and NOT because of his those policies ( which he do — though many ‘ historians ’ he did ) . The turning-point , from FDR ’ s foreign policies , was on 25 July 1945 . That ’ s what got this snowball rolling down this fascist-imperialist mountainside , of the world ’ s history , since then . It ’ s what caused Truman quickly to all of FDR ’ s foreign-policy team . Truman was the catastrophe — the continuation . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even worse . And it still . FDR was the .

"Two years ago, Burma (Myanmar) saw a huge non-violent movement of civic disobedience in response to a military putsch. However, it was ultimately forced to engage in armed self-defense in the face of merciless repression. Was it any different in India? Was independence, the liberation from British colonial rule in 1947, effectively won through the civil disobedience movement embodied by Gandhi? We put this question to Sushovan Dhar. Myanmar lived, from February 2021, what was perhaps the most far-reaching and widespread movement of non-violent civil disobedience in modern and contemporary history, in response to the army’s desire to secure a monopoly on state and political power, which it shared with the National League for Democracy. The very day after the putsch, the vast majority of the public refused to collaborate with the junta. Had it received the international support it deserved at that time, the military coup would probably have been aborted. This was not the case. Thanks to this respite, the junta was gradually able to regain the offensive, engaging in a ferocious crackdown which, to date, has cost the lives of more than 4,000 civilians. In the central plain, the popular movement was forced to engage in armed resistance (which was already the case in the ethnic states of the mountain periphery), in the face of ruthless power. The civic disobedience movement was not in vain. The illegitimate nature of the military government became abundantly clear, making it impossible to quickly normalise the regime in the diplomatic arena. Links were forged between all the regions of the central plain and many ethnic states. Resistance was able to develop over time. However, non-violent mass action was not enough to force the army to abandon its policy of terror against the population."

And it ’ s in that vein , that we asked both Long and De Sousa to share the best piece of life advice they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finding your purpose and operating toward your passion . “ I remember an actress told me , ‘ N ever pass on work. ’ And she was an older woman , maybe close to 70 . Beautiful actress . And I remember thinking to myself , ‘ I don ’ t know if that applies to me. ’ Because if I look at it as work , how can it be art ? ” Long explained to The Root . “ So I have to kind of look at it as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job that I ’ ve chosen .

And it ’ s just about understanding what the assignment is so your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcome ends up being . Live in the truth of the moment and understand what you ’ re doing. ” For De Sousa , she shared that it ’ s important to attempt to go after the things that make you passionate because that ’ s what ’ s going to keep you going when it ’ s all said and done . “ It ’ s important to keep evolving as a person and as you get older , there ’ s gon na be a whole ‘ nother evolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continuing to learn and grow and learn about yourself and know thyself , ” she explained . “ And also , when you talk about what you really love—I think if you ’ re gon na do something , if you ’ re gon na be in business—the only thing that ’ s gon na get you up the next day and keep you going is you really , really , have to love it .

"But there are three notable aspects to this attempt. First, even if he had managed to pass that resolution, it would have been dead on arrival in the Senate. Second, unlike Gingrich back then, McCarthy tried to go where the money isn’t, slashing nonmilitary discretionary spending. That’s a fairly small part of the federal budget. It’s also a spending category that has already been subject to more than a decade of austerity, ever since President Barack Obama made concessions to Republicans during the debt ceiling confrontation of 2011. There just isn’t any significant blood to be gotten out of this stone. Finally, even this extreme proposal wasn’t extreme enough for Republican hard-liners. I liked what one representative told Politico: “Some of these folks would vote against the Bible because there’s not enough Jesus in it.” The point is that the party’s right wing isn’t actually interested in governing; it’s all about posturing, and the budget fight is a temper tantrum rather than a policy dispute."

"The election is still 423 days away, and Biden and an affiliate of his chief super PAC are already running TV ads in nearly every major battleground state — far earlier than normal for a presidential election. And instead of going on the attack, as super PACs usually do, the ads are trying to boost Biden’s image. Future Forward USA Action, an arm of the top super PAC backing Biden’s reelection bid, is spending more than $12 million on an ad campaign that began Friday in the biggest markets of six major battleground states. That puts the outside group and the campaign — which is a month into its own sustained ad campaign — on the air earlier than Trump and his allies began advertising in earnest for the 2020 election, for example. Future Forward USA Action’s aren’t going after Trump, the odds-on favorite to be the Republican standard bearer. The spots, which are cosponsored by the group Climate Power, are instead boosting Biden, whose average approval rating is only 42 percent, according to RealClearPolitics, lagging slightly behind Trump (who lost reelection) and Obama (who won) at this stage of their presidencies. They particularly seek to shore up Biden in perhaps his greatest area of vulnerability: voters’ negative views of the state of the economy. Biden’s average approval rating on the economy is 38 percent, about 4 points lower than his overall approval rating."

"Photo: Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty Images Joe Biden’s reelection bid faces several obstacles. Voters are still agitated by the past two years of inflation. The young are unenthused by the president, the Electoral College is likely still somewhat biased toward the GOP, non-white voters are drifting rightward, and third-party candidates are threatening to nibble at the Democrat’s margins. But Biden’s biggest liability, by far, is his age. If reelected, the president would be 86 years old at the end of his next term. Very few Americans hold any job at that advanced age (according to Pew, 86.7 percent of Americans over 75 are retired). The notion that someone born in 1942 will be well equipped to serve as president in 2028 strains the electorate’s credulity."
"What is it that the right-wing is objecting to with regard to the video in which Rahul Gandhi cooks and partakes in Champaran mutton, with Lalu Prasad and some of his family members at his daughter Misa’s home in Delhi? Is the consequent severe trolling by the BJP and its allies because Rahul Gandhi is supposed to be a Brahmin and ate meat, or is it because he ate meat during the month of Saawan? Also, does calling him a “Janeudhari” Brahmin in any way add some extra weight to the “wrongdoing” that he is alleged to have committed? He did not just eat the dish but also packed some for his sister. So, that’s two “Brahmins” eating meat, much to the trolls’ ire. Given the kind of cosmopolitanism prevalent in contemporary India, putting people in pigeonholes does not suit anyone, whether on the right of centre or otherwise. Moreover, the mainstreaming attempts of the right-wing, whereby differences and diversity is anathema to them, are old hat by now and firmly passe."
"Although the cash-for-visas scandal knocked Poland’s ruling right-wing party off its stride, it also helped to ensure that migration remained a key issue in the closing stages of Poland’s parliamentary election campaign. The governing party has tried to refocus debate onto the EU “migration pact”, where the opposition remains vulnerable, and in such a closely fought electoral contest the issue could be critical to the outcome. Mobilisation is the key"
""""""" Should public officials—even the ones you really don ’ t like—be allowed to have a moment ’ s peace in their personal lives ? During his appearance on Fox News Sunday this past weekend , Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg dismissed concerns over people protesting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh from outside of Morton ’ s steakhouse in Washington , D.C. , last week . By Buttigieg ’ s telling , this was no big deal . Just normal citizens who want to “ exercise their First Amendment rights. ” Buttigieg is a master at making the radical sound reasonable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of monster could be against citizens who are “ peacefully protesting ” their rights being “ taken away ” ? Here , though , some context is needed to see the full picture . It ’ s not like citizens organically saw Kavanaugh walk into a restaurant and then spontaneously decided to protest him . A lefty group called Shutdown DC appears to have been involved , and the group sent out a Twitter message on the heels of the Morton ’ s protest , asking service industry workers to tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court justices are dining , in exchange for up to $ 250 in payment . ( For context pertaining to the times in which we live , just one month ago , a man traveled to Kavanaugh ’ s house with a plan to assassinate the justice . ) Buttigieg began his Fox News comments with the caveat that public officials “ should always be free from violence , harassment , and intimidation , ” and yet , the protests outside of Morton ’ s were cheered on by prominent online activists with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know peace ” and “ no justice , no peace. ” Does attempting to deprive a public official of any semblance of peace in their private lives constitute harassment and intimidation ? Not in Mayor Pete ’ s world . Of course , the intimidation wasn ’ t directed solely at Kavanaugh or the other conservative justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade . The protesters reportedly “ demanded that the [ restaurant ] manager kick Kavanaugh out. ” And after Morton ’ s refused to cave to the mob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with phony reservations and phone calls . In his brief comments on Fox News , Buttigieg explained that “ these protesters are upset because a right…was taken away. ” But surely people on the right feel the same way from time to time , which doesn ’ t make it any more of a civilized tactic . By going out of his way to reiterate the protesters ’ grievances , Buttigieg betrays that his assessment of the protesters ’ tactics was at least partially premised on the righteousness of the cause . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive speech to be literal violence—while simultaneously excusing rioting as not violence , but legitimate speech . This makes me wonder whether Buttigieg would be such a free speech absolutist if the shoe were on the other foot . During the interview , Buttigieg claimed that he would be OK if it were , adding , “ I can ’ t even tell you the number of spaces , venues , and scenarios where I ’ ve been protested. ” Let ’ s take him at his word . But how about everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s say the Oath Keepers started following Justice Sonia Sotomayor around , paying bounties to restaurant employees who rat on her whereabouts , and “ encouraging ” restaurant managers to kick her out of places . Sounds pretty creepy , right ? How would the media portray that ? How would progressives feel about these citizens exercising their rights ? Or take Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , who mocked Kavanaugh for having to leave the restaurant “ before his soufflé. ” Let ’ s imagine if the Proud Boys started surveilling her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be calling this form of First Amendment expression by its other name : stalking . One of Buttigieg 's undeniable political talents is his ability to take a radical position and frame it as something so wholesome and anodyne that it might be mistaken for a plot point from Leave It To Beaver . It ’ s an auspicious skill in politics , but it ’ s really a form of gaslighting .

""""""" The Herculaneum victims of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD were blasted with such extreme heat that their soft tissue disappeared , scientists have discovered . In a paper released May 27 , scientists have revealed more details of the eruption that destroyed Pompeii . Pier Paolo Petrone , a forensic anthropologist at the University Federico II of Naples , Italy , and co-author Francesco Sirano , director of the Herculaneum Archaeological Site , have discovered that bone proteins from skeletons found in Herculaneum were better preserved than those in the bodies found in Pompeii . The eruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the deadliest volcanic eruptions in history . Several unlucky nearby cities , including Pompeii and Herculaneum , were buried beneath extremely hot pyroclastic flows and ashfall . The remains of the inhabitants are famously well-preserved , with their final moments being frozen in time by the unique conditions that preserved their bodies for thousands of years . Herculaneum , which was located just three miles from Mount Vesuvius , is thought to have experienced temperatures much higher than were present in Pompeii , twice as far away . Petrone told Newsweek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors hypothesized that temperatures at Herculaneum were low since they found some collagen in sporadic bone remains . Now , the new results clearly show that the suggestion that low temperatures correspond to good proteome quality , while high temperatures are associated with degraded organic matter , does not fit with the new evidence highlighted in the victims ' bones from Herculaneum and Pompeii . '' Collagen and other bone proteins do not generally survive extreme heat exposure , not to mention the action of microbes over long periods of time , soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all factors that can have adverse effects on the preservation of organic matter hidden in bone . However , the specimens from Pompeii show a lower content of non-collagenous proteins , higher deamidation level and higher extent of collagen modification , despite being exposed to a lower temperature . `` This indicates that in the case of the 79 AD eruption , organic matter preservation is independent from the intensity of heat , while it has been largely influenced by different ways of soft tissue decay ( very fast or extremely slow ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soils , ) as well as hydrogeological ( constant or periodic moist environment ) properties of the volcanic ash deposits in which the corpses were buried , '' Petrone told Newsweek . In Pompeii , the slow decomposition of corpses ' soft tissues in the natural dry-wet hydrogeological soil cycles damaged their bone proteome more than what was experienced at Herculaneum .

"Reading the recent excerpt from McKay Coppins’s forthcoming biography of Mitt Romney of Utah, I was struck by the depth of the senator’s contempt and disdain for much of the Republican Party, including many of his colleagues in the Senate. He condemned their vanity, their venality, their cowardice. “Every time he publicly criticized Trump, it seemed,” Coppins writes, describing Romney’s account, “some Republican senator would smarmily sidle up to him in private and express solidarity.” Romney made note of the “rank cynicism” of his Republican colleagues and their almost total refusal to stand up for anything that might harm their future electoral prospects. He saved his harshest words, however, for those Republican senators who would do or say anything for political power and influence. What bothered Romney most about Hawley and his cohort was the oily disingenuousness. “They know better!” he told me. “Josh Hawley is one of the smartest people in the Senate, if not the smartest, and Ted Cruz could give him a run for his money.” They were too smart, Romney believed, to actually think that Trump had won the 2020 election. Hawley and Cruz “were making a calculation,” Romney told me, “that put politics above the interests of liberal democracy and the Constitution.”"

"Hard-right House Republicans are threatening to block a stopgap bill to keep the government funded unless it includes a security crackdown along the U.S.-Mexico border, escalating fears of a shutdown within weeks and injecting the supercharged politics of immigration into an already fraught stalemate over federal spending. Members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, whose demands for deep cuts have already stymied agreement on a spending package for the coming year, now say they are unwilling to support even a temporary measure to prevent a lapse in federal funding without a sweeping border measure that has little chance of making it through Congress. The measure, which would revive policies championed during the Trump administration such as border wall construction, extended detention of asylum seekers and expedited deportation of unaccompanied minors, was so draconian that G.O.P. leaders barely managed in May to scrounge together the Republican votes needed to pass it. It has stalled in the Democrat-controlled Senate and would render any spending bill that carried it dead on arrival there."

On voter rolls , Republicans want voters to re-register if they haven ’ t voted in five years . Voter requirements include proof of residency , citizenship , and a photo ID . They also approved compiling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary of state ’ s office can remove deceased persons from voter rolls . They also want to repeal all motor voter laws .

We refuse to let Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ” he said . Democrats have long dismissed the idea of significant voter fraud swaying the outcome of the 2020 election , calling it misinformation perpetuated by former President Donald Trump in his effort to overturn a legitimate election . Texas Republicans also made election integrity a top legislative priority for the 2023 session . Delegates want to restore felony penalties and enact civil penalties for election code violations . They want to restrict the distribution of mail-in ballots , limit early voting , and close Republican primaries . The Republicans also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s attorney general to have the authority to prosecute election fraud , after the all-Republican Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled the state ’ s attorney general couldn ’ t unilaterally do so in December 2021 .

"Brexit and Donald Trump’s election highlighted a global surge in populism. The Economic Freedom of North America Network, of which the Johnson Center is a member, has discussed conservative populists’ growing hostility to markets. Populists should, I hope, embrace free markets and limited government. We first need a definition of populism. Prior to 2016, left-wing groups opposed to the corporate world order were populists. Political scientists focus on hostility toward elites, which I will accept. New research in the 2023 Economic Freedom of the World report finds that populism, identified via a new measure based on this definition, correlates with lower economic freedom internationally. Free market economists have long opposed elites and experts. Thomas Sowell titled a book on elitist intellectuals, The Vision of the Anointed. Austrian economics argued that socialism would not work because experts could not know enough to run an economy well. Even Adam Smith railed against paternalistic elites."
"The fascist form of capitalist rule is never immediately imposed, but is gradually insinuated into daily life, growing in force, power, and violence until the forces behind it secure state power. Fascists fight to normalize assaults on democracy, democratic institutions, socialistic and radical movements, and even liberal democratic forces. Above all, their violence is directed against people and communities who have won a right to exist and to sometimes thrive through democratic protections. The fascistic impulse to normalize violence and hate has been thrust into the foreground of U.S. society for more than a decade. To secure power, fascists target democratic institutions for elimination. As this is being done, liberal democratic forces work to continue to sustain a belief in the neutrality of those institutions as an abstract process, operating independently from its real-life context. The fascist goal is to absolutely destroy any beliefs in institutions and processes in order to create a perceived need for a dictatorial individual or party to rule in their place. As George Dimitrov argued, “By destroying the relics of bourgeois democracy, by elevating open violence to a system of government, fascism shakes democratic illusions and undermines the authority of the law in the eyes of the working people.” While his reference to a positive belief by working class and democratic forces in the “authority of the law” is to a utopian notion of an abstract process, his full statement makes it clear that he was not encouraging a blind belief in the “illusions” of the democratic process with its current class content."

"Pick any week this summer, and you’d likely find a headline about a new front in America’s long-running partisan culture wars – perhaps “surprising” or suspect or both, and usually framed by rightwing pundits as a victory. Maybe it was the backlash to an Anheuser-Busch marketing campaign featuring the transgender TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney that bumped Bud Light from the top of the beer market. Or the country singer Jason Aldean’s Try That In A Small Town, a song threatening violence to anti-police protesters; its streams increased 999% after backlash to its music video, which featured footage of Black Lives Matter protests and was filmed at a Tennessee courthouse where a Black man was lynched in 1927. Or the box office success of Sound of Freedom, an independent Christian film about child trafficking tied to QAnon, or the overnight appearance of Oliver Anthony’s welfare-denigrating song Rich Men North of Richmond on the Billboard Hot 100. In part, it’s a familiar story: a smattering of songs, shows and films turned into culture war symbols, illuminating the amorphous, yet stark cultural divide in the US. “This is happening with everything,” said Lilliana Mason, an associate professor of political science at Johns Hopkins and the author of Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity. “It’s always evolving. New things become the thing of the day, and so one thing replaces another. It’s the same outrage, it’s just a different target.”"

"Southernized In 1969, a young aide in the Nixon White House , 28-year-old Kevin Phillips, published ""The Emerging Republican Majority.""Phillips had worked as a strategist on Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign, the experience of which supplied much of the material for his book. His argument was straightforward: Nixon's victory wasn't just a momentary triumph but the beginning of an epochal shift in American politics, fueled by a latent conservatism among many members of the white middle class. These voters were repulsed, Phillips wrote, by the Democratic Party 's ""ambitious social programming and inability to handle the urban and Negro revolutions.""The latter point was key. ""The principal force which broke up the Democratic (New Deal) coalition is the Negro socioeconomic revolution and liberal Democratic ideological inability to cope with it,"" Phillips declared. ""The Democratic Party fell victim to the ideological impetus of a liberalism which had carried it beyond programs taxing the few for the benefit of the many (the New Deal) to programs taxing the many on behalf of the few (the Great Society).""If one tallied Nixon's share of the national popular vote, at 43.5%, and added it to the share won by the governor of Alabama, George Wallace, at 13.5%, then you had, in Phillips' view, the makings of a conservative majority. ""It was Phillips' thesis,"" historian Geoffrey Kabaservice recounts in ""Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party , From Eisenhower to the Tea Party,"" ""that the Republicans could build an enduring majority by corralling voters troubled by 'the Negro problem' and drawing in elements that had not traditionally been part of the Republican Party: conservatives from the South and West, an area for which Phillips coined the term 'the Sun Belt.'""To some extent, Phillips was remarking on a shift that was already in motion. Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 and 1956 elections and Nixon in the 1960 election made gains with white Southerners.Phillips was also not the first person to notice the potential of racial strife to move this process along. Barry Goldwater, the party's 1964 nominee for president against Lyndon Johnson, won five states of the former Confederacy, doing so on the basis of his vociferous opposition to the Civil Rights Act passed that year.Wallace rested his campaigns, in 1964 and 1968, on the observation that when it came to civil rights, ""the whole country was Southern."" And in his attempt to parry and marginalize Wallace, Nixon aimed directly at the white voters of the South. ""Vote for the only team that can provide the new leadership that America needs, the Nixon-Agnew team,"" the Republican nominee said in a radio advertisement tailored to white Southern voters. ""And I pledge to you we will restore law and order in this country.""But having written a popular book about the future Republican majority -- a book that would prove quite prescient, as Republicans established a durable hold on partisan politics in the South -- Phillips is the man who gets credit for both seeing the opportunity and developing the eventual strategy. As he told journalist Garry Wills during the 1968 campaign, ""The whole secret of politics is knowing who hates who.""Phillips died this week of complications from Alzheimer's disease. He was 82. By the end of his life, he had become a sharp critic of the Republican Party, condemning the extremism, military adventurism and free-market fundamentalism of the George W. Bush years in a 2006 book, ""American Theocracy: The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century.""Phillips' turn against the modern Republican Party he helped create gets at what made his work significant. He didn't just identify a constellation of political, social and economic forces that could produce a durable Republican majority; he identified a social base for the right-wing conservatism that would, in short order, eclipse its ideological rivals within the Republican Party. The new Southern Republicans would be avowedly conservative, committed to the destruction of as much of the social insurance state as possible.You could draw a straight line, in other words, from ""The Emerging Republican Majority"" to the Newt Gingrich revolution of the 1990s to the present, when Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana briefly emerged as the leading candidate for speaker of the House before withdrawing from the race on account of fierce opposition from many of the more radical members of the House Republican conference.First elected to Congress in 2008, Scalise is associated with the hard-right flank of the House Republican caucus. But more relevant to our story is the fact that he represents the state congressional district that once sent David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, to the Louisiana state Legislature. Duke's election, in 1989, was the start of a political ascendancy that culminated in a bitterly fought campaign for governor, which Duke lost -- while winning more than 60% of the white voters who cast ballots in that election.Duke was a toxic figure, condemned by most of the mainstream in the Republican Party, nationally and in Louisiana. But his campaign essentially foreshadowed the transformation of Louisiana politics in the 1990s and into the 2000s, when right-wing Republicans -- adopting Duke's anti-tax, anti-welfare and anti-government rhetoric -- supplanted conservative Democrats.Together, Phillips' death and Scalise's near ascension to the speakership form an interesting synchronicity. On one hand, we have the intellectual father of the Southern strategy, who died estranged from the political party he helped shape. On the other, we have the rise, however brief, of a lawmaker who represents the total success of that strategy.A funny thing has happened as the national Republican Party has rooted itself ever more deeply into the South: The Southern style of conservative politics -- hidebound, populist, staunchly anti-union and devoted to the interests of capital above all -- has migrated well above the Mason-Dixon Line. We've seen it take hold in Wisconsin, Kansas, even Maine. It should be said that Scalise's original rival for the speakership, MAGA radical Jim Jordan, is from Ohio.The Republican Party did not just win the white South in the years and decades after Phillips wrote ""The Emerging Republican Majority."" Nor did it just become the party of the white South -- or at least its most conservative elements. No. What happened is that the Republican Party, with a politics and an ideology rooted in some of the most reactionary -- and ultimately destructive -- tendencies of that political tradition."

""""""" A former Minneapolis police officer has pleaded guilty to a state charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd MINNEAPOLIS -- A former Minneapolis police officer pleaded guilty Wednesday to a state charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in the killing of George Floyd , admitting that he intentionally helped restrain the Black man in a way that created an unreasonable risk and caused his death . As part of Thomas Lane 's plea agreement , a more serious count of aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder will be dismissed . Lane and former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already been convicted on federal counts of willfully violating Floyd 's rights . While they have yet to be sentenced on the federal charges , Lane 's change of plea means he will avoid what could have been a lengthy state sentence if he was convicted of the murder charge . The guilty plea comes a week before the two-year anniversary of Floyd ’ s May 25 , 2020 , killing . Floyd , 46 , died after Officer Derek Chauvin , who is white , pinned him to the ground with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Floyd repeatedly said he couldn ’ t breathe . The killing , captured on widely viewed bystander video , sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the globe as part of a reckoning over racial injustice . Lane , who is white , and Kueng , who is Black , helped restrain Floyd , who was handcuffed . Lane held down Floyd ’ s legs and Kueng knelt on Floyd ’ s back . Thao , who is Hmong American , kept bystanders from intervening during the 9 1/2-minute restraint . All three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial scheduled for June is expected to proceed for Kueng and Thao . Lane is scheduled to be sentenced on the state charge Sept. 21 . In his plea agreement , Lane admitted that he knew from his training that restraining Floyd in that way created a serious risk of death , and that he heard Floyd say he couldn ’ t breathe , knew Floyd fell silent , had no pulse and appeared to have lost consciousness . The plea agreement says Lane knew Floyd should have been rolled onto his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that should be done — but he continued to assist in the restraint despite the risk . Lane agreed the restraint was “ unreasonable under the circumstances and constituted an unlawful use of force . '' The state and Lane 's attorneys agreed to a recommended sentence of three years — which is below state sentencing guidelines — and prosecutors agreed to allow him to serve that penalty at the same time as any federal sentence , and in a federal prison . One legal expert said this would appeal to Lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being incarcerated with people he had arrested . Lane , who is white , told Judge Peter Cahill that he understood the agreement . When asked how he would plead , he said : “ Guilty , your honor. ” Attorney General Keith Ellison , whose office prosecuted the case , issued a statement saying he was pleased that Lane accepted responsibility . “ His acknowledgment he did something wrong is an important step toward healing the wounds of the Floyd family , our community , and the nation , ” Ellison said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is a significant moment in this case and a necessary resolution on our continued journey to justice. ” Lane 's attorney , Earl Gray , said in a statement that Lane did not want to risk a lengthy prison sentence if convicted of aiding and abetting murder , so he agreed to plead guilty to aiding and abetting manslaughter . “ He has a newborn baby and did not want to risk not being part of the child ’ s life , ” Gray said . Wednesday 's hearing was streamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their attorneys issued a statement afterward , saying Lane 's plea “ reflects a certain level of accountability , ” but that it came only after his federal conviction . “ Hopefully , this plea helps usher in a new era where officers understand that juries will hold them accountable , just as they would any other citizen , ” family attorneys Ben Crump , Jeff Storms and Antonio Romanucci said . “ Perhaps soon , officers will not require families to endure the pain of lengthy court proceedings where their criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded guilty last year to a federal charge of violating Floyd ’ s civil rights and faces a federal sentence ranging from 20 to 25 years . The former officer earlier was convicted of state charges of murder and manslaughter and is currently serving 22 1/2 years in the state case . Lane 's plea comes as the country is focused on the killing of 10 Black people in Buffalo , New York , by an 18-year-old white man , who carried out the racist , livestreamed shooting Saturday in a supermarket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of federal charges in February after a monthlong trial that focused on the officers ' training and the culture of the police department . All three were convicted of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care and Thao and Kueng were also convicted of failing to intervene to stop Chauvin during the killing . After their federal conviction , there was a question as to whether the state trial would proceed . At an April hearing in state court , prosecutors revealed that they had offered plea deals to all three men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , Gray said it was hard for the defense to negotiate when the three still do n't know what their federal sentences would be . Rachel Moran , a law professor at the University of St. Thomas , said it ’ s possible Lane received a better offer , though the public doesn ’ t know what happened behind the scenes . As for the other officers , she said Lane ’ s guilty plea has “ got to make them think. ” “ Particularly when I think most people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culpable of the three — and he ’ s the one pleading guilty , ” Moran said . “ Now if you are one of the other two left standing , it might change your position . ... They may have less appealing offers to work with , but it still puts pressure on them. ” It ’ s still not clear what federal sentence Lane and the others could face . Many factors go into determining a federal sentence ; One legal expert told the AP earlier this year that a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 years . Federal sentencing dates have not been set . Under state sentencing guidelines , a person with no criminal record could face a sentence ranging from just under 3 1/2 years to four years and nine months in prison for second-degree unintentional manslaughter , with the presumptive sentence being four years . Lane ’ s recommended sentence of three years , which still must be approved by the judge , would be five months less than the low range . If Lane had been convicted of aiding and abetting second-degree murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 1/2 years in prison . And prosecutors served notice in 2020 that they intended to seek longer sentences for Lane , Kueng and Thao — as they did for Chauvin . “ That ’ s a very sweet deal , ” John Baker , a former defense attorney who teaches aspiring police officers at St . Cloud State University , said of Lane 's agreement . Baker said a guilty plea makes sense and he would not be surprised if at least one of the other former officers also took a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paule , was in the courtroom for Lane ’ s plea hearing . When asked if his client would also plead guilty , he replied “ No comment. ” Storms , one of the Floyd family attorneys , said the deal with Lane happened “ very quickly .

""""""" WASHINGTON — The House passed legislation to keep the government running until Dec. 16 , a final act of business before both chambers of Congress recess for six weeks until the midterm election . The Friday vote was 230-201 , with 10 Republicans joining Democrats to pass it . The bill , which passed the Senate by a vote of 72-25 on Thursday , now goes to President Joe Biden , who is expected to sign it before the midnight deadline to avert a shutdown . The stopgap measure gives congressional leaders additional time to negotiate a full-year funding deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priorities they intend to tackle in the lame-duck session . That includes a defense authorization bill and a package of changes to election laws designed to prevent another Jan. 6-style attempt to overturn a presidential election . The bill includes $ 12 billion in assistance to Ukraine , money for Afghan refugees , enhanced security for U.S. courts and a five-year reauthorization of user fees for the Food and Drug Administration . House Republican leaders pressured their members to vote against the legislation , indicating a split between House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who supported the measure . It is a sign that must-pass funding measures could get contentious if Republicans capture the House this fall . The Senate 's top two appropriators — Committee Chair Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , and Richard Shelby , R-Ala. — are retiring at the end of the year and want to go out with a larger funding deal , rather than punt the issue into the new year . Even though Congress successfully kept the government open , the session ended on a sour note for some House Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party leaders for failing to call a vote on her TRUST in Congress Act , which would ban members of Congress from trading stock while in office . The bill is aimed at boosting transparency and battling possible insider trading by requiring members , as well as their spouses and dependent children , to put certain assets in a blind trust . “ This moment marks a failure of House leadership — and it ’ s yet another example of why I believe that the Democratic Party needs new leaders in the halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long made known , ” said Spanberger , who faces a difficult re-election bid in November . “ Rather than bring Members of Congress together who are passionate about this issue , leadership chose to ignore these voices , push them aside , and look for new ways they could string the media and the public along — and evade public criticism. ” This article was originally published on NBCNews.com """""""

""""""" Bill Maher Smashes COVID Lies , Will Likely Be Called an ‘ Alt-Right White Supremacist ’ By The Week ’ s End Though the Free Thought Project doesn ’ t play in to the two-party paradigm , there is a faction of the establishment left that is worth calling out . This group of institutionalized pundits has no ground to stand on when it comes to continuing to push for restrictions , mandates , and lockdowns over COVID-19 , yet they continue to do so — not following any science at all . When the public chooses not to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel , those people become the enemy . Because the two party paradigm keeps its members in blinders as not to see common ground , anyone who chooses to go against the party ’ s demands must be part of the other , evil party . The sheer lunacy associated with these identity politics means that anyone on the left who calls out the intolerance or authoritarianism from within — is now part of the Alt-right — including hardcore leftists . In the following example , put out by the lovely folks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all folks who support the trucker convoy as far-right , white supremacists . There is no doubt that some small percentage of the people supporting the truckers fit into this category but to group in all Republicans with white supremacists is disingenuous at best and egregiously deceptive at worst . By this logic , the entire left should be judged based on the actions of Antifa . But free thinking rational folks simply do not do this , and for good reason… it leads to the opposite of progress . Despite many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hit pieces like this demonize groups who stand up for freedom because it goes against the establishment narrative of vaccine mandates , lockdowns , and unscientific hodgepodge that must be followed to remain in the club . This black and white identity divide is why people like Bill Maher are a thorn in the side of their scheme . Maher is one of the most outspoken and well known leftists in the media and when he doesn ’ t toe the line , it makes the establishment left look silly , corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this weekend ’ s show , Maher has likely made many enemies within the Branch Covidian cult . During a three-minute rant , Maher destroyed the narrative for masking children , called out the ineffective nature of the lockdowns , and put Biden on blast for his vaccine misinformation . The end result was nothing short of inspiring . “ It ’ s time to do what a growing list of countries have done and announce we ’ re going back to something more like normal , beginning with recognizing that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary and horrible — and I don ’ t even like kids , ” he said as his monologue began . “ But make kids who have a COVID survivability rate of 99.98 % mask up like bandits ? ” he said . “ Unfortunately , the thing that ’ s getting stolen is their education , their sanity , and their social skills. ” He then brought up the recent study from John ’ s Hopkins which is predictably absent from all mainstream press other than FOX . “ A study this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Hopkins concluded that the lockdowns we all suffered through had little impact in reducing COVID deaths , ” he pointed out . “ Okay , ” he said . “ That ’ s kind of a big one to get wrong. ” As we reported last week , a new report by economists who carried out a meta-analysis , found that coronavirus lockdowns had ‘ little to no ’ effect on pandemic death tolls in the US , UK and Europe . The lockdowns , according to the researchers , only reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdowns didn ’ t stop deaths , they certainly caused a lot of them . Their report , led by a Johns Hopkins University professor — which has not been peer-reviewed — concluded : After blasting lockdowns , Maher set his sights on the messiah of Team Doom , president Joe Biden . “ Last July president Biden said , you ’ re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations , ” Maher continued . “ Well , I already knew that was wrong then . And now we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden though , the CDC , Anthony Fauci , and the mainstream press all came out en masse and claimed that the vaccine would not allow you to transmit or even catch covid . As the world quickly found out , however , that was a massive lie . Toward the end of the rant , Maher went after the sacred cow — the origination of covid . For those who recall , anyone who even mentioned the words “ lab leak ” in 2020 were unceremoniously banned from social media , forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established narrative of “ virus bad , it come from bats. ” A year later , however , and the lab leak became the most prevalent theory . “ The former director of the CDC Robert Redfield believes COVID originated in a lab and now our intelligence agencies agree : It might have , ” Maher went on . “ But for months on social media , it was banned to even discuss it. ” “ Look , I ’ m not saying the medical establishment isn ’ t trying to figure s**t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — although there is some of that — but how about just wrong , wrong , a lot , ” he said . “ Wrong about HIV , wrong about lockdowns , wrong about kids , wrong about how you couldn ’ t get it if you were vaccinated , ” he said . “ Remember washing our packages ? ” “ And there ’ s never been research showing that outdoor transmission is likely or common , ” he aptly pointed out . “ Yet , LA county says we ’ re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor events like we ’ ll be at the Super Bowl. ” Maher then showed images of Cali . Gov . Gavin Newsom disobeying his own mandate at the NFC championship game last weekend as the crowd erupted in applause . “ It ’ s all theater . Watching athletes mix it up on the court and then mask on the sideline . Not being able to touch a menu , but watching them touch my food . Maskless at dinner while sitting , but not standing . And by the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our health , they would make us cover our mouths after the food arrived , ” Maher joked . “ I ’ m just asking ; how much wrong do you get to be while still holding the default setting for people who represent the science ? ” he asked . This is a question to which an answer is quickly coming to fruition . As their lies and anti-science narrative come crashing down , their last stitch effort is to name call and resort to the only card they have left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will likely soon be branded a member of the “ Alt-right ” and maybe even a “ white supremacist. ” As TFTP has long been labelled over the years — incorrectly and deceptively — by this censorship class , Maher should welcome the slander , because it means he ’ s finally over the target .

As a result , since July 27 , the pipeline has operated at only 20 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 mln cubic meters per day .

"Protesting against forced conscription, workers went on a general strike that started in Wiltz on August 31, 1942 and spread across the country. 21 workers were executed by Nazi authorities for participating in the action On Thursday, August 31, trade unions and leftist organizations in Luxembourg commemorated the general strike of August 1942 that was organized by workers against the Nazi occupation and forced recruitment of workers to the Nazi army, the Wehrmacht, during World War II. Various events were organized at Wiltz, Esch-sur-Alzette, and Luxembourg city on Thursday, where leaders and cadres of the Independent Luxembourg Trade Union Confederation (OGBL), the Communist Party of Luxembourg (KPL), and Dei Lenk (The Left), among others, paid tributes to the 21 workers who were executed by the Nazi German occupiers for participating in the strike. A memorial event was also organized in Differdange on September 2. During World War II, while Luxembourg was under German occupation, the Nazi authorities demanded the conscription of young Luxembourgers into the Wehrmacht to fight the Allies. To protest against this forced conscription, workers went on a general strike that started in Wiltz on August 31, 1942 and spread across the country. The Nazi authorities tried to suppress the strike with an iron fist as the Gestapo, or the Nazi secret police, arrested hundreds of strikers and put them in torture camps. 20 strikers were detained at the Hinzert concentration camp between September 2-9 and one in Cologne, who were all executed. Several students and youths were sent to correctional facilities and many workers and their families to labor camps in Eastern Europe."

As Israel goes about its righteous task in the weeks ahead, as Hamas manipulates the watching world, all of us ... should heed the timeless words of Ecclesiastes: 'For everything there is a season.'

""""""" Child Predator Given Three Months in Prison by Ketanji Brown Jackson Continued Looking at ‘ Sexually Arousing ’ Pictures of Boys After Release A child pornography offender given only three months in jail by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson continued to lust after children following his early release .

Johnson , who is President-imposed Joe Biden ’ s affirmative action pick for the Supreme Court , gave the man only three months instead – in the name of social justice or some other low IQ leftist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectifying content of children after his release . According to the Washington Post , the probation office petition regarding the offender noted that he “ continues to seek out sexually arousing , non-pornographic material and images of males 13 to 16-years-old ” even though he has been in “ treatment for more than five years. ” This news may give credence to the right-wing axiom that only effective “ treatment ” for pedophiles involves a bullet to the head . It also shows how Jackson ’ s appointment is an affront to decency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rule of law . Big League Politics reported on Sen. Josh Hawley ( R-MO ) sounding the alarm on Jackson ’ s history of coddling predators and enabling the victimization of children : “ President Joe Biden ’ s Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson , who was picked by Biden solely because of the color of her skin , has a shocking and disturbing history of apologizing for child predators on the bench . Sen. Josh Hawley ( R-MO ) wrote a Twitter thread sharing what his office has discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victimizers of children , and it is beyond disgraceful . “ I ’ ve been researching the record of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson , reading her opinions , articles , interviews & speeches . I ’ ve noticed an alarming pattern when it comes to Judge Jackson ’ s treatment of sex offenders , especially those preying on children , ” Hawley wrote . “ Judge Jackson has a pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook for their appalling crimes , both as a judge and as a policymaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since law school . This goes beyond “ soft on crime. ” I ’ m concerned that this a record that endangers our children , ” he added . Hawley showed quotes from Jackson that highlighted her dangerous far-left ideology that coddles predators and provides them with undeserved leniency after committing despicable acts to children . “ In the current climate of fear , hatred , and revenge associated with the release of convicted sex criminals , courts must be especially attentive to legislative enactments that “ use [ ] public health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in essence , punishment and detention. ” Judges should abandon the prevention/punishment analyses that rely on legislative intent…and that assess the “ excessiveness ” of a sex offender statute ’ s punitive effects in favor of a more principled approach to characterization , ” Jackson wrote . In another opinion , Jackson claimed there may be a “ less-serious child pornography offender ” whose motivation for collecting child pornography is not of a sexual nature but rather due to “ the challenge , or to use the technology , ” whatever that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ m wondering whether you could say that there is a – that there could be a less-serious child pornography offender who is engaging in the type of contact in the group experience level because their motivation is the challenge , or to use the technology ?

""""""" An article published this past weekend in The New York Times highlights a glaring problem with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and its policy recommendations related to the pandemic during the past two years . The problem has to do with lack of transparency regarding hospitalizations for COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccinations for the illness.1 2 The Times article , written by Apoorva Mandavilli , starts out : The CDC has shared only a “ tiny fraction ” of its COVID data with the American public ? Former CDC Director Thinks Agency Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to CDC spokesperson , Kristen Nordlund , one of the reasons for the lack of data transparency is because “ basically , at the end of the day , [ the data is ] not yet ready for prime time , ” noting that the CDC ’ s “ priority when gathering any data is to ensure that it ’ s accurate and actionable. ” 1 In an interview with Fox News , former CDC director Robert Redfield , MD confirmed this view , saying… But Dr. Redfield suggested that he disagreed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes whatever data the CDC collects should “ absolutely get out there in real-time. ” He added : CDC Reluctance to Track COVID “ Breakthrough Cases ” Due to Fear of Contributing to Vaccine Hesitancy Nordlund reportedly said that another reason for the CDC ’ s hesitancy to be more transparent was due to fear that its data might be misinterpreted—that information about the number of fully vaccinated people “ breakthrough ” SARS-CoV-2 infections , for example , could lead to concerns about the effectiveness of the COVID shots.1 2 Epidemiologist Jessica Malaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the team that ran The COVID Tracking Project,5 dismissed the CDC worries about incomplete data being misinterpreted . She said , “ We are at a much greater risk of misinterpreting the data with data vacuums , than sharing the data with proper science , communication and caveats. ” During the past two years , the CDC has frequently been criticized for its COVID and COVID vaccine data collection practices , its mixed and confusing messaging and a growing perception that the agency has not been fully transparent with the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 Perhaps one of the clearest examples of the CDC ’ s failure to provide timely and accurate COVID-related information is the agency ’ s inability or unwillingness to adequately track the number of cases in which fully vaccinated ( and boosted ) individuals have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 . Because of this , it is not known how many “ breakthrough cases ” there have been in the United States . Consequently , there is no way to know for sure how effective the COVID shots have been in preventing the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This represents a huge and fundamental scientific knowledge gap underlying the primary tool the U.S. government has aggressively pushed on the American people to deal with COVID . But this is only part of the problem . That other part has to do with the lack of reliable information regarding the number of people in the U.S. who have been hospitalized with COVID . In April 2021 , the CDC arbitrarily decided to stop tracking coronavirus breakthrough cases so that it could focus on tracking only breakthrough cases that resulted in hospitalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this major change in policy would allow the agency to more accurately gauge the number of vaccinated people being hospitalized for COVID and , by extension , the overall number of people hospitalized for the illness.12 CDC System for Tracking COVID Hospitalizations in Need of Overhaul But it has recently come to light that the system the CDC has been using to count COVID hospitalizations is deeply flawed . According to an article in Politico on Feb. 7 , 2021 titled “ Biden officials trying to recalculate U.S. Covid-19 hospitalizations , ” the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with “ hospitals nationwide to improve COVID-19 reporting. ” The task force wants hospitals to report the number of patients who are hospitalized because they have COVID and separate those from the patients who are hospitalized for other reasons but test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus after being admitted.17 18 As reported by The Vaccine Reaction earlier this month : What this suggests is that , in the past , U.S. hospitals have been counting people hospitalized for reasons other than COVID as COVID patients if they happened to test positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the effect of increasing hospital COVID case counts , making the effects of COVID on U.S. hospitals appear worse than they actually were . Remember all those media reports about how overwhelmed hospitals were with COVID patients ? It now appears that at least some of that reporting may have been inaccurate , even grossly inaccurate.18 So not only do we not know how effective the COVID shots have been in real-world circumstances , we do not know how many vaccinated ( or unvaccinated ) people have been hospitalized for COVID—which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people have actually died of COVID , in general . It is no wonder the CDC has consistently found it so difficult to be forthcoming .

""""""" The one-year anniversary of the January 6 riot on Capitol Hill is upon us . If you watch cable news , you know that there has been an abundance of stories to remind us . One question that doesn ’ t get asked very much is whether or not Capitol Police are prepared to handle any such future attacks . After the January 6 , 2021 riot , assessments were made by both lawmakers and law enforcement . Today , Politico breathlessly asks if such an event happens again , will law enforcement be ready ? The answer seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made is that there is a new police chief in charge . Thomas Manger took over the department in August . He says the department is ready . One glaring problem that hasn ’ t been resolved is a shortage of personnel . How can Capitol Police be prepared if they don ’ t have enough people to reasonably handle the job ? Officers are still coping with the trauma in the aftermath emotionally , according to reports , and some politicians note that the police force is overtaxed . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress spiking . Manger says the department is “ probably 400 officers down from where we should be. ” He cites the retirement or resignations from 135 officers since January 6 . According to its website , the department employs more than 2,300 officers and civilian employees . Rep. Bennie Thompson ( D-MS ) and Liz Cheney ( R-WY ) made the rounds on some of the Sunday morning political shows to talk about the work of the January 6 committee . Thompson chairs the committee . He thinks that if such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready , if intelligence sharing capabilities are in place . He points to what was a frequently asked question after January 6 – the word was out there that protesters would rally in D.C. that day so why wasn ’ t the department prepared to handle it ? No one knew the magnitude of what would happen , as it was a rare kind of event on Capitol Hill , but there is no denying that Capitol Hill Police were caught flat-footed . Thompson points to intelligence gathering . “ I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 6 of last year , that if something like that occurred this time , the likelihood of anything close [ happening again ] would be zero , ” Thompson said in an interview . “ The only question is whether or not we have put our intelligence gathering entities on a sharing path … It was the worst-kept secret in America that something was going to happen , and why our agencies did not pick it up in real-time and be better prepared is one of those weaknesses we have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a dry run of what a response to the possibility of an unruly event might be , though , and it sure doesn ’ t inspire confidence that intelligence gathering has gotten any better . The rally that was reported to happen on September 18 with some people who were involved in the January 6 rally left egg on the faces of law enforcement agencies in D.C . The rally was sparsely attended and it looked like there were more undercover FBI agents than Trump supporters . Manger pointed out some improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emphasis on non-lethal gear to handle crowd control . Every Capitol Police officer now carries a department-issued phone that provides real-time emergency alerts . The phones address what became a crippling problem on Jan. 6 : A flood of radio traffic that drowned out key messages and left officers feeling leaderless during the fighting . The department ’ s riot control unit , singled out as deficient on Jan. 6 , now has more diverse “ non-lethal ” gear to help with crowd control . Its intelligence analysts now regularly share threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those officers lamented that their leaders never informed them of prior intelligence about the potential for violence at the Capitol . The department brought in an operational planning expert who has previously organized Secret Service security during major events and Congress allocated an additional $ 100 million last summer to the department . Here ’ s an interesting nugget – Congress passed legislation “ giving the Capitol Police chief the unilateral authority to seek National Guard assistance , eliminating a hurdle that delayed a request for help on Jan. 6 , 2021. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s the transparency on that ? It makes sense but isn ’ t the Biden administration supposed to be the most transparent , ever ? One question that still hasn ’ t been answered is why didn ’ t Pelosi call in reinforcements for the Capitol Police when it became clear they were in over their heads ? Why didn ’ t she , as Speaker of the House , act quicker ? Independent watchdog Michael Bolton says there is still much to be done . He notes a lack of emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants to see Capitol Police function more like a protective agency , like Secret Service , than a police department . The January 6 committee is also supposed to weigh in on recommendations for improvement , though we know it is focused on Trump and his supporters ’ actions on that day . In order to raise the caliber of recruits and increase professional behavior , Bolton recommends that officers obtain secret or top-secret level security clearances . This would involve extensive background checks and ferret out any who would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that some Capitol police aided protesters in entering the building that day and others high-fived the rioters and offered support to them . Manger says the threats against Congress have escalated . He said the number of threats totaled 9,600 in 2021 . Additional personnel is needed as there is no end in sight . He may think that the department is more prepared to handle whatever comes their way but it sounds like there is still much to do , a year out from the January 6 riot last year @ """""""

"On October 8, 1912, the Kingdom of Montenegro declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Montenegro was soon joined by Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria, initiating the First Balkan War. This was seen as a war of national liberation against Ottoman rule, which was pushed back from most of its European land. However, the inter-imperialist rivalries among the Great Powers operated behind the scenes. By June 29, 1913, a Second Balkan War began as the Great Powers turned the victors from the first war, along with previously neutral Romania, against each other. National conflict flared up a third time the following year, but the result, rather than a Third Balkan War, was the First World War. When the Balkan Wars broke out, Russian Revolutionary Leon Trotsky arrived on the scene to experience them firsthand. Exiled to Vienna following the defeat of Russia’s 1905 Revolution, he worked as a journalist for the left-wing Ukrainian paper Kievskaya Mysl (Kyivan Thought). In the Balkans, he served as their war correspondent.

"(Bloomberg) -- Iceland’s finance minister, who resigned this week on conflict-of-interest grounds, will swap positions with the nation’s foreign minister, the government announced on Saturday. Thordis Kolbrun Reykfjord Gylfadottir, foreign minister since 2021, takes over at the finance ministry from Bjarni Benediktsson, who quit in a scandal over the sale of the state’s shares in Islandsbanki hf, where his father was among the investors. His resignation stirred speculation on the viability of Iceland’s three-party coalition, which joins the Independence Party on the right, the Left Green movement on the left, and the Progressive Party in the center."
"At a lunchtime press conference on Tuesday, Daniel Andrews announced that he was resigning as premier of Victoria, Australia’s second-most populous state.

"Fred Rosen, who calmly guided NACLA through the most challenging decades of its history, passed away on September 12, 2023, at age 81 in Cuernavaca, Mexico, after a long struggle with Parkinson’s disease. A radical economist with deep roots in New York social justice work, Fred found his calling and NACLA found its guardian when he joined the organization as editor in 1992 on its 25th anniversary. Over the next 20 years, he would occupy every significant role in NACLA as he fought, with a quiet tenacity, to keep the organization afloat. “In a period when it would not have been strange for NACLA to go out of business because there wasn’t that compelling interest in Latin America, he managed to get us through,” said Steven Volk, a professor of history emeritus at Oberlin College and the chair of NACLA’s Board of Directors from 1984 to 2000."

"No one should be surprised by the recent meeting between Israel’s ambassador to Romania, Reuven Azar, and the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians party (AUR), George Simion — an encounter that has drawn outrage from some Israelis and diaspora Jews. The AUR is well known as a fascist, antisemitic party that glorifies Romania’s World War II-era leader, Ion Antonescu, whose regime oversaw the extermination of about 400,000 Romanian Jews. It is a small but vocal party, which won roughly eight percent of the vote in the last election. While the full contents of the meeting have not been made public, it was presumably at least partly connected to Israel’s ongoing efforts to persuade Romania to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In 2018 and early 2019, Israel was able to get public statements supporting the relocation by the then-Romanian prime minister and the speaker of parliament. However, the Romanian president blocked the move in late 2019, saying that such an action would not happen without a joint decision in the European Union."

"Even as U.S. politics became more contentious and polarized over the past quarter century, a few pockets of the government remained comparatively above the fray, including the courts, which sought to position themselves apart from politics, and state capitols, where pragmatism trumped partisanship. But those redoubts have fallen in recent years. The Supreme Court has become more ideologically aligned with the Republican Party, and state legislatures host pitched ideological battles. Now institutions that sit at their intersection—state courts, especially state supreme courts—have emerged as a site of bitter fights. This fall, Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature are mulling plans to impeach Janet Protasiewicz, a recently elected liberal justice on the state supreme court, before she has even heard a case—by all appearances for the crime of having been elected as an outspoken liberal. In North Carolina, Anita Earls, a liberal justice on the state supreme court, has sued the state’s Judicial Standards Commission over an investigation it began into fairly anodyne comments she made about implicit racial bias in a press interview."

"A few days ago, the Writers Guild of America finally reached a tentative agreement with Hollywood executives after a five-month strike. They writers took on the studios, which now include some of the biggest tech companies on the planet, and won major concessions. Meanwhile, the president of the United States just walked an autoworkers’ picket line in my home state of Michigan. His main rival, former president Donald Trump, hasn’t talked to the United Auto Workers (UAW) — but only because the UAW told him to stay away. (He spoke at a nonunion plant near some striking workers and hoped no one would see the difference.) Both Biden and Trump are clearly reading the polls showing that a supermajority of Americans support the UAW’s strike against the Big Three automakers, and responding accordingly. Even Manhattan Institute fellow Allison Schrager admits that the “labor movement is having a moment.” That can’t be an easy thing for a fellow at a right-wing think tank to concede. But not to worry; the world hasn’t turned upside down. Now that the Right is forced to reckon with the surge in labor movement activity, it’s only expressing its typical antiunion sentiment in a more subtle way. In a nationally syndicated op-ed published earlier this month at Bloomberg Opinion, Schrager argues that unless unions “reform,” the moment they’re having now could be “their last gasp.” Right now, workers are benefiting from a tight labor market, but that will change. Schrager predicts — or maybe just hopes — that the “political environment” will become “less favorable to unions.” (Translated from think-tank-ese to English, that means that union-busting Republicans will come to power.) Fortunately for the labor movement, Schrager has some advice to offer. She recommends that unions give up on all of this fighting-with-the-bosses-to-get-a-bigger-slice-of-the-pie nonsense. Instead, they should work with the bosses on finding arrangements with more “flexibility” — think-tank-ese for accepting lower wages and less protections — and otherwise focus on providing various sorts of insurance services for their members. If they do this, she says, unions can “save themselves.” I’m sure it’s disinterested advice and merely a coincidence that the Manhattan Institute is funded by the Koch family, Goldman Sachs, and numerous plutocrats whose interests aren’t served by labor unions that actually behave like unions. But leaving that aside for a moment, we should ask: Do Schrager’s arguments make any sense? Do unions really need to tone it down for their own good? America’s Union Blues This time two years ago, there were zero unionized Starbucks locations. I can remember standing in a bar in Los Angeles a year and ten months ago, when there was exactly one, arguing with a left-wing friend who told me it was a flash in the pan and — unfortunately, in his view — wouldn’t go anywhere. Today there are 355. Again, there’s no denying that organized labor is having a moment. The question is how durable that moment is. Schrager points to a Gallup poll showing that, while 71 percent of Americans approve of labor unions, “two-thirds” (actually 58 percent) are uninterested in joining one themselves. “That,” she says, “helps explain why many union drives fail.” Her point here is that unions are terribly unpopular, and they had better tread lightly in this moment or risk losing their tenuous hold on the American public. Other sources diverge considerably from the Gallup number, and show that at least half of nonunionized workers want to join up. But let’s assume for the sake of argument that the percentage with at least some interest in joining up is only 42 percent. Organizing 42 percent of the nonunion workforce would mean quadrupling the unionized workforce. That would be an earthquake in labor-capital relations. So why hasn’t it happened? Schrager’s careful phrasing — “helps explain” — gives her some wiggle room, but she’s pretending not to see the elephant in the room. American labor law is absurdly slanted against workers trying to get organized. When a majority of employees at a workplace sign union cards, that isn’t enough for a union to be recognized. There has to be a certification election. In the run-up, bosses can force workers to attend “captive audience” meetings while they’re on the clock to subject them to antiunion propaganda and, quite often, thinly veiled threats that the place will shut down if a union is recognized and everyone will lose their jobs. The union doesn’t have a right to make their countercase or even have representatives present at the meeting. American labor law is absurdly slanted against workers trying to get organized. The whole thing’s about as democratic as it would be if, in the run-up to next year’s presidential election, Joe Biden could legally force every American to come to a meeting where they heard about his accomplishments, no Republicans were given speaking time, and the meeting ended with a heavy insinuation that if Biden were to lose the election he might just be forced to blow up the country to stop the Republican candidate from taking office. If a group of workers does succeed in organizing a union and negotiations fail and they go out on strike, then the playing field is tilted in a vastly more antiunion direction than it is in many other countries. If the workers jump through all the hoops to go on a legally sanctioned strike, the bosses can’t “fire” them — but they can “permanently replace” them. If the workers end their strike after being “permanently replaced,” the boss doesn’t have to rehire them unless new openings come up. Meanwhile, different groups of workers are generally prohibited from acting in solidarity with each other. It would be illegal, for example, for screenwriters to stay out on strike until the actors have had their demands met. And as bad as all of that is, that’s only what unions have to deal with when the letter of the law is being followed. In real life, companies routinely go well beyond the legal boundaries and usually get a slap on the wrist at most. For example, Starbucks Workers United says that more than two hundred of its members have been illegally fired in retaliation for union activity the last two years. In a couple dozen cases, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has agreed and ordered the workers to be reinstated, but even that hasn’t happened in the vast majority of cases. The NLRB is severely underfunded, and existing law gives the board few options for imposing meaningful penalties. No one should hold their breath waiting for Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan or his predecessor Howard Schultz to be led away in handcuffs for breaking labor law. And still, despite the attempted death by strangulation of American unions, many people are interested in joining one. That figure is remarkable for the exact opposite reason Schrager identifies. Schrager thinks unions are skating on thin ice. In truth, despite every attempt to undermine the labor movement, unions remain a viable option in the minds of millions of American workers, offering something of obvious value."

"There is a certain pattern to modern impeachment inquiries. They typically begin after the discovery of blatantly incriminating evidence. In 1998, the House of Representatives began its impeachment inquiry only after DNA tests on Monica Lewinsky’s blue dress exposed that Bill Clinton had lied under oath about their affair. In 2019, the House opened its impeachment inquiry only after it received reports that Donald Trump had attempted to coerce President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine into investigating Trump’s chief domestic political opponent. The day after Nancy Pelosi announced the inquiry, the White House released a rough transcript of Trump’s call with Zelenskyy, and Americans could see that Trump did indeed press Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden, as a “favor” in response to Ukraine’s request for Javelin anti-tank missiles. And we all know what happened after Jan. 6, 2021. The House initiated the second impeachment of Trump only after his weekslong festival of lies about election fraud culminated in a violent attack on the Capitol."
"Over the past twenty-five years, UCLA economic historian Robert Brenner, a longtime contributor to the New Left Review, has developed an increasingly influential theory of what he calls “the long downturn” — the global economic slowdown that began in 1973 with the passing of the postwar boom. In Brenner’s account, for a half century the world economy has stagnated under the weight of a long crisis of profitability caused by chronic overcapacity in global manufacturing — a problem that first made itself felt with the postwar reentry of German and Japanese firms into already-saturated export markets, but which has only gotten worse with time. For Brenner, chronic overcapacity is the symptom of a flaw in the economic mechanism of capitalism, arising from the unplanned anarchy of market production: firms in overcrowded industries, saddled with sunk costs in the form of fixed capital, lack the incentive to withdraw from unprofitable lines of business, resulting in intractable pileups of excess capacity that breed cutthroat competition, sinking profit rates, and, ultimately, stagnation. The politics of the Brenner thesis might not be obvious to the naked eye, but we got a glimpse of it earlier this year via a commentary by the Berkeley sociologist Dylan Riley, a sometime coauthor of Brenner’s, criticizing certain socialists for what Riley thought were their overly indulgent evaluations of the Biden administration’s industrial policies. Whatever the merits of his case, what was notable about Riley’s article was the use he was able to make of Brenner’s economic framework in service of a political argument: Bidenomics, he believes, will result in “a massive exacerbation of the problems of overcapacity on a world scale,” and this fact, in his judgment, exposes “neo- Kautskyite” socialists as lacking a “credible answer to the structural logic of capital.” Crisis in Theory Some readers might still be puzzled about what the connection is, exactly. Why should the prospect of, say, overcapacity in the global solar panel industry exert any influence one way or the other on how socialists judge something like the Inflation Reduction Act? As Eric Levitz of New York Magazine pointed out, a “global glut of low-carbon technology” is hard to see as a nightmare scenario, to put it mildly. But what might seem like a non sequitur becomes less mysterious once you’ve grasped the political subtext underlying Brenner’s theory of the long downturn. A few years before he debuted his thesis in a 1998 issue of the New Left Review, Brenner delivered a talk to fellow members of the socialist group Solidarity on the problem of how revolutionaries should relate to social democrats. (The talk was published under the title “The Problem of Reformism.”) The question was pressing because reformism, as he explained it, was “our main political competitor,” and “the inescapable fact is that, if we want to attract people to a revolutionary-socialist banner and away from reformism, it will not generally be through outbidding reformists in terms of program. It will be through our theory — our understanding of the world.” What distinguishes reformism from revolutionary socialism is not its support for reforms; revolutionaries seek reforms, too. In fact, “as socialists, we see the fight for reforms as our main business.” The real basis of the division lies instead in the reformists’ personal material interests, as well as their theory of capitalism. What distinguishes reformism from revolutionary socialism is not its support for reforms; revolutionaries seek reforms, too. The social basis of reformism, Brenner explained, lay in the ranks of the trade union bureaucracies and social democratic party apparatuses. Since their organizational interests were unavoidably threatened by outbreaks of unabashed class struggle, reformists always opposed militant movements from below. They urged workers to confine their actions to voting for social democrats on election day and backing official trade union actions on the job. Reformists, in other words, want workers to place their fate in the hands of reformists. That was why they were always claiming that “state intervention can enable capitalism to achieve long-term stability and growth”; that the working class can “use” the state to pursue those objectives “in its own interests.” Reformists have to maintain these positions because without promises like these, given their opposition to class struggle, reformism and its organizations would have nothing to offer the working class at all. By the same token, the praxis of revolutionaries must stay closely connected to their theory of economic crisis. Revolutionary socialists must always emphasize that “crises arise from capitalism’s inherently anarchic nature,” and that because of the system’s “unplanned” character, “governments cannot prevent crises.” Only then could they make the case to workers that reformism cannot and will not work, regardless of the alleged good intentions of the reformers. This, according to Brenner, was why, “for revolutionaries, so much is riding on their contention that extended periods of crisis are built into capitalism.” Brenner was hardly the first to elevate crisis theory to so central a role in socialist political practice. The connection has been a staple of Marxism ever since the outbreak of the great revisionist controversy in the 1890s. When Eduard Bernstein, the protégé-turned-apostate of Marx and Engels, called on social democracy to embrace a reformist route to socialism, he put the issue of capitalist crisis at the heart of his case: crises were becoming less frequent and, above all, less apocalyptic as capitalism matured, Bernstein argued. With the scenario of total breakdown seeming increasingly remote, the revolutionary option was robbed of both its plausibility and its justification. Bernstein’s salvo forced the defenders of Marxist orthodoxy, in its various shades, to sharpen their own theoretical arguments, and by the 1920s there were two identifiable poles of analysis in Marxist crisis theory: Rosa Luxemburg’s “underconsumptionist” view, which stressed the inadequacy of working-class purchasing power as the main source of the system’s crisis tendencies; and the German social democrat Rudolf Hilferding’s “disproportionality” theory, which traced the root of crises to the recurrence of accidental mismatches between the outputs of the different branches of industry — a hazard arising from the “blind,” unplanned nature of capitalist investment. When looking back at these debates, what comes into view is the perennial reflex, among Marxists of a certain mindset, to judge theories of crisis according to a criterion of nonreformability: the source of crisis must be something that can be plausibly depicted as ineradicable without some unspecified revolutionary supersession of the existing mode of production. When looking back at the Marxist debates over revisionism, what comes into view is the perennial reflex, among Marxists of a certain mindset, to judge theories of crisis according to a criterion of nonreformability. Now, there are sensible reasons to expect economic crises under capitalism to arise from forces that reflect the vested interests of capitalists themselves in one way or another — in which case, attacking the roots of crisis requires attacking capitalist interests. But actual nonreformability turns out to be a maddeningly mobile target. Take, as an example, Hilferding’s crisis theory, which attributed economic turbulence to “disproportions” in the pattern of capitalist investment, arising from the system’s “anarchic” and “unplanned” development. Like Brenner today, Hilferding — the leading economic expert of the interwar German Social Democratic Party — held that only planning could solve the problem of disproportions. He pointed to the growth of private industry cartels since the late nineteenth century: these were proof that capitalists themselves had been forced to accept the logic of planning to stabilize increasingly chaotic markets. However, cartels were ineffective in the final analysis: as long as they remained purely private, voluntary initiatives, they were unable to bring order to their industries because they could not effectively discipline their members. To stabilize the economy in a lasting way, comprehensive planning would have to be undertaken by the state. From today’s vantage point, Hilferding’s crisis mechanism might seem soundly reform-proof: after all, the planning of prices and production is nowadays assumed to be too strong a medicine for capitalism to swallow. But in the 1930s, Hilferding was roundly attacked by socialists to his left for what they saw as the reformist implications of his theory. For in the ’30s, “planning” was seen by many on the Left as the ruling class’s preferred path to economic stabilization, the route to recovery that posed the smallest threat to the status quo. Recall the history of the Roosevelt years: the “First New Deal” of 1933–35, centered on the National Industrial Recovery Act — with its compulsory cartelization of the private economy and imposition of mandatory price floors and output quotas — was the “conservative” phase. The “Second New Deal” that began in 1935 — with its welfare state measures, jobs programs, and union-friendly labor laws — was the “radical” phase. In the ’30s, ‘planning’ was seen by many on the Left as the ruling class’s preferred path to economic stabilization, the route to recovery that posed the smallest threat to the status quo. The same pattern held throughout Europe, where the right wing of the socialist and labor movements embraced the New Deal-ish “planisme” advocated by the Belgian Labor Party and its theorist Hendrik De Man. Left-wing socialists and communists denounced the allegedly fascist undertones of planism and espoused neo-Luxemburgist doctrines of underconsumption. For them, taming the anarchy of production seemed potentially achievable under capitalism. What seemed unthinkable was a drastic redistribution of wealth. But just a few years later the wheel would turn once again, as a combination of war and pressures from below forced the capitalist world to accept redistributionism on a scale that had once seemed inconceivable. The consequences were, so to speak, revolutionary. In Britain, the share of national income going to the bottom 50 percent, which had been less than half the share of the top 1 percent in 1910, ballooned to more than double its level by 1950. So it was only a matter of time before underconsumptionism, once regarded as the radical doctrine of Red Rosa, came to be seen as the ruling-class palliative of John Maynard Keynes — sending crisis theorists off once again in search of browner pastures. The Rise of the Falling Profit Rate In the 1970s, a very different kind of crisis descended on the capitalist world. This time, there was no question of attributing the problem to a shortage of mass purchasing power: the late 1960s and early 1970s had witnessed a “wage explosion” throughout the industrialized countries amid full employment, tight labor markets, and a wave of heightened working-class militancy. Accordingly, a so-called profit-squeeze account of the crisis — whose locus classicus was Andrew Glyn and Bob Sutcliffe’s massively influential British Capitalism, Workers and the Profits Squeeze — immediately gained adherents among Marxist and Marx-adjacent scholars in the English-speaking world. (The profit-squeeze theory is sometimes called the “wage-squeeze” theory; the idea, in either case, is that profits were being squeezed by wages.) The profit-squeeze theory painted the turmoil of the 1970s as a sort of mirror image of the 1930s Depression: just as the earlier calamity had been exacerbated by wages that were too low, sapping aggregate demand, now working-class militancy had pushed wages up too high, eroding the profit rate and bringing investment to a halt. Initially this account held attractions across the Marxist spectrum. All sides could agree that profit rates had, in fact, declined as wages had surged. And for a fair number of radicals, the theory could be seen as vindication for the kind of militant “transitional” strategy long espoused by Trotskyists: demanding “reforms” calculated to be impossible for capitalism to deliver. Revolutionaries in the trade unions, the thinking went, had helped spur the working class to greater heights of militancy, and the resulting wage demands had now produced a full-blown crisis of capitalism to which ruling-class Keynesians had no response. However, once it became clear that the 1970s crisis was not leading to revolution, the profit-squeeze account came to be seen in the opposite light: as giving ideological sanction to schemes of wage moderation — “incomes policies” — long advocated on anti-inflation grounds by Keynesian experts in social democratic parties. In the radicals’ view, the Svengalis of incomes policy and their political masters in the cabinet offices found it all too easy to muster willing recruits for wage moderation in the trade union bureaucracies — whose leaders, in turn, were all too eager to offer their services to anxious social democratic politicians hoping to “manage” the crisis in the interests of crass electoralism. However, once it became clear that the 1970s crisis was not leading to revolution, the profit-squeeze account came to be seen in the opposite light: as giving ideological sanction to schemes of wage moderation. In 1969, a book called Marx and Keynes: The Limits of the Mixed Economy was published by Paul Mattick, a German council communist and self-taught adept of Marxian political economy who had settled in the United States in the 1920s to become a tireless — and, for decades, generally ignored — evangelist for the ideas of the largely forgotten Polish theoretician Henryk Grossmann, whose 1929 opus The Law of Accumulation and Breakdown of the Capitalist System was notable for being one of the few substantial works of pre-1970s Marxist writing to ground its theory of crisis firmly in Marx’s famous “Law of the Tendency of the Profit Rate to Fall.” “It is my contention,” Mattick wrote with apparently remarkable prescience in his book’s introduction, “that the Keynesian solution to the economic problems that beset the capitalist world can be of only temporary avail, and that the conditions under which it can be effective are in the process of dissolution. For this reason the Marxian critique of political economy, far from having lost its pertinency, gains new relevance through its ability to comprehend and transcend both the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ economics.” When these prognostications seemed to come true a few years later, an exhilarated cohort of youthful New Left Marxists, in quest of a new reform-proof crisis theory, embraced Mattick as their lodestar and dusted off Marx’s falling rate of profit (FROP) conjecture. One of them, David Yaffe, who prominently championed the FROP throughout the 1970s, stated the case squarely in a critical review of the Glyn/Sutcliffe book that appeared in the New Left Review in 1973. “The crisis of profitability,” Yaffe wrote, “far from being caused by large wage increases, results from the contradictions of capitalist production itself which has its expression in the tendency of the rate of profit to fall.” Taking the wage-squeeze theorists to task for their apostasy, he explained their error in terms almost identical to those of Brenner discussing the problem of reformism two decades later: If the capitalist mode of production can ensure, with or without government intervention, continued growth and full employment, then the most objective argument in support of the revolutionary socialist position breaks down. The reformist perspective then becomes a reasonable one. Thus, over the course of the 1970s, by a process of ideological self-selection, the FROP came to be, as the late Simon Clarke put it in his study of Marxist crisis theory, “associated politically with a sectarian millenarianism” that was becoming increasingly conspicuous in certain ultramontane sectors of the shrinking post-’60s Marxist left. In an exasperated counterblast published in 1973, Paul Sweezy decried “an interpretation of Marx’s theory of capital accumulation which appears to be shared, with variations, by a growing number” of Marxist economists, a group for whom Sweezy personally had become “a favorite target.” This school of thought — of which “Paul Mattick perhaps deserves to be called the dean” — was characterized by a “fetishization of the falling tendency of the rate of profit” and a general approach to Marxism that had “degenerated into a sterile orthodoxy.” With the Mattick-ites charging their Marxist opponents with heresy and their opponents tarring the Mattick-ites as fundamentalists, it’s easy to see how the FROP could come to be perceived, by Marxists and non-Marxists alike, as, for better or worse, the purest standard of Marxian orthodoxy. To this day, in fact, it’s widely assumed that the FROP has always been the orthodox Marxist theory of crisis. With the Mattick-ites charging their Marxist opponents with heresy and their opponents tarring the Mattick-ites as fundamentalists, it’s easy to see how the ‘falling rate of profit’ could come to be perceived as the purest standard of Marxian orthodoxy. But the truth is almost the opposite: in the eight decades between Friedrich Engels’s death and the OPEC oil shocks, the FROP played almost no role in the various crisis theories of most leading Marxist authorities. Rosa Luxemburg was famously contemptuous of the idea. Karl Kautsky mentioned it as a factor tending to promote the centralization of capital, but not as an important cause of crisis. The relevant chapter of Sweezy’s hugely influential 1942 textbook of Marxian economics, The Theory of Capitalist Development, noted that the law “has been the object of numerous criticisms from both followers and opponents” of Marx, and devoted a whole section to “A Critique of the Law.” Ernest Mandel in his 1967 Introduction to Marxist Economic Theory included a dutiful five-page section on the law and then studiously ignored it for the rest of the book. There’s even good reason to doubt Marx’s own commitment to the idea. Clearly the FROP was a theory Marx wanted to believe was true. Just as physicists and mathematicians have been known to hope that an especially elegant theory or theorem will end up being confirmed by a future proof or experiment, Marx wanted to find a way to make the FROP work because, within the context of his theory, it led, as Duncan Foley put it in his 1986 Marxian economics textbook, to “a beautiful dialectical denouement.” But Marx was a scrupulous scholar, and every time he tried to work out the details of the concept in his notes and drafts of the 1850s and 1860s, he found himself — as the German Marxologist Michael Heinrich has shown — lost in a maze of algebra that could only prove that a falling profit rate was a possibility, not a necessary outcome of capitalist development. The Law of the Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall entered the corpus of Marxian thought thanks to Engels’s incorporation of some of these materials in the posthumously published third volume of Capital. But, as Sweezy noted in 1942, Marx’s analysis in that section was “neither systematic nor exhaustive” and “like so much else in Volume III it was left in an unfinished state.” How central, then, was the FROP to Marx’s view of capitalism? In Marx’s Theory of Crisis, Clarke made a compelling case: “Perhaps the best indication of the importance that Marx attached to the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall is that he did not mention it in any of the works published in his lifetime, nor did he give it any further consideration in the twenty years of his life that followed the writing of the manuscript on which Volume Three of Capital is based.” In other words, exactly a century before Mattick’s youthful disciples excitedly rediscovered the FROP, Marx had definitively lost interest in it. Exactly a century before Mattick’s youthful disciples excitedly rediscovered the FROP, Marx had definitively lost interest in it. In the decades after 1973, Marxism as a political force suffered punishing defeats. But at the level of scholarship, it enjoyed a remarkable renaissance. Marxist economics in particular saw a tremendous increase in its level of theoretical sophistication and technical competence thanks to a generation of radicals who had joined the academy during the Vietnam War era. One of the leading lights of that cohort was Anwar Shaikh of the New School for Social Research, who emerged over the course of the 1970s and 1980s as the preeminent scholarly proponent of the FROP and the broader approach to Marxism with which it is associated: “classical Marxism,” in Shaikh’s terminology; “fundamentalist Marxism” (or, more politely, “orthodox Marxism”) in the mouths of its detractors. But however orthodox, Shaikh is a scholar’s scholar, not a blinkered doctrinaire. His 2016 summum opus, Capitalism: Competition, Conflict, Crisis — a 1,026-page treatise presenting the fruits of his four-decade-long research program — is a work of remarkable erudition, notable for its consistent conceptual clarity, careful attention to empirical evidence, and refusal to settle for hand-waving or appeals to authority. Shaikh’s book does for Marxian political economy what Paul Samuelson’s 1947 Foundations of Economic Analysis did for neoclassical economics: setting it on a firm theoretical foundation informed by the most rigorous modern methods. And among the many topics it addresses is Shaikh’s version — Shaikh would say Marx’s version — of the theory of the falling profit rate. Thus, by the time Robert Brenner presented his alternative falling-profit-rate theory, the falling-profit-rate theory — the classical FROP of the third volume of Capital — had acquired an odd status within Marxism. It had never been especially popular with the leading Marxist authorities, and was now in especially bad odor thanks in part to the strident dogmatism of some of its noisiest champions. And yet, it had quietly benefited from two decades of careful and intelligent reconstruction at the hands of Shaikh and a few other serious scholars, including Duncan Foley and the French researchers Gérard Duménil and Dominique Lévy. Because of the classical FROP’s perceived canonical status, and because it, as much as Brenner’s version, has always been intended to serve as a “reform-proof” theory of crisis, the two theories deserve to be assessed side-by-side."
"While Britain has long been a leader in cutting emissions, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is now implementing a stunning reversal of climate-friendly policies, with new plans to “max out” oil production. Business leaders have joined environmentalists in condemning the moves. In 1988, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher became the first world leader to take a stand on fighting climate change. Last month, exactly a quarter-century later, her successor Rishi Sunak tore up a cross-party consensus on the issue that had survived the intervening eight general elections and replaced it with a populist assault on what had been his own government’s environmental policies. Thatcher, who trained as a chemist before entering politics, took her stand at a packed meeting of the country’s most prestigious science body, the Royal Society, on September 27, 1988. She told the assembly that “we are creating a global heat trap which could lead to climate instability” and promised action to curb global warming and achieve “stable prosperity”. That speech marked the start of 25 years during which Britain led the world in cutting its carbon dioxide emissions, which are today 47 percent below 1990 levels. But on September 27, 2023, another Conservative prime minister, former banker Rishi Sunak, sounded what many regarded as a retreat from climate leadership and the pursuit of “stable prosperity.” As part of a new policy to “max out” oil production, his government gave the go-ahead for exploiting Britain’s largest untapped oilfield in the North Sea. Most analysts saw the new policies as an attempt to mollify right-wing critics and seduce voters wary of the costs of climate action."

""""""" Ages before modern tourists flocked to Greece to enjoy its sun , sea , antiquities , and adventure , people of the Roman Empire descended on Greece for the same reasons . Antony and Cleopatra headed for a romantic island tryst on Samos ; the emperor Tiberius preferred Rhodes . Some Romans attended the famous philosophy schools and drenched themselves in Greek history ; others came for the Olympic Games ; still others were attracted by the sensational—a chance to gawk at the egg hatched by Leda after her affair with Zeus in the guise of a swan , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen had bathed , or to gasp as professional divers jumped off the notorious “ Lover ’ s Leap ” of Leucadia , a 200-foot promontory where Sappho was said to have ended her life . And they all lugged home souvenirs : terracotta statuettes , trinkets , pots of Hymettian honey , silk scarves from Cos , gnarled walking sticks from Sparta , copies of racy Milesian love stories , and entire temple columns and thousands of statues . Greek hospitality was renowned long before the Roman sightseers arrived . People who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek cities , and as early as the fifth century B.C . innkeepers let rooms in towns and along roads . Famous temples and sanctuaries provided public accommodations run by the host city or by other cities for their own citizens visiting the shrine . The fourth-century politician Demosthenes mentioned a hotel popular with ambassadors near the Temple of the Twins in Pherae on the northern coast of Greece , and the remains of an ancient hostel for visitors to Athens was found in Plateia in modern times . Herodotus was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for curiosity and pleasure in the fifth century B.C.. His books related the many strange customs and marvels he saw and heard about on his tours ( see chapters 1 and 21 ) . By the fourth century B.C. , foreign travel was becoming more common , as diplomats , messengers , mercenaries , tradespeople , merchants , poets , philosophers , musicians , artists , actors , and athletes all traveled for business , education , or pleasure . Ordinary and rich folk alike made journeys to attend festivals and religious celebrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sparta allowed visitors only short , rigidly supervised tours of its sights and restricted the travel of its own citizens . By Roman times , however , Sparta had become a sort of “ theme park , ” a must-see on every tourist ’ s list , where Old Sparta ’ s myths , legendary austerity , and harsh discipline were glorified . Gullible tourists could view Leda ’ s Egg ( out of which Helen of Troy hatched ; sophisticated travelers dismissed the large beribboned egg as that of an ostrich ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular Roman poet Ovid probably hoped to see beautiful Spartan women wrestling in the nude , but they had to settle for statues of clothed female runners or women warriors brandishing swords . Tourists could watch endurance contests in which stoic Spartan teenagers were flogged , in the theater built by Roman entrepreneurs to accommodate hundreds of spectators . Or they could witness puppy sacrifices , exciting boar hunts , and brutal mock battles ; visit the cave where criminals were confined , the altar where human sacrifices took place , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to die . They could admire “ vicious Laconian hounds ” paraded on leashes ; and wander through the impressive “ victory ” colonnade displaying Persian spoils and columns in the forms of chained captives . Many of the bloodthirsty images of ancient Sparta current today actually come from descriptions of these commercialized sideshows created to entertain the Roman tourists . Travelers stayed at inns along roads , near the city gates , or in the town center . Then , as now , the comforts of these lodgings varied enormously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide their own food and linens , and they could expect to encounter hard beds , bedbugs , mosquitoes , little privacy , shady characters , and brawls . Wealthier tourists avoided these quarters and booked accommodations in luxurious converted mansions , with garden patios or dining rooms catering to Romans used to reclining during dinner . Wayfarers could buy simple snacks and wine at a modest café called a kapilos . All inns of the day provided sexual companionship of varying standards and costs . Rich , famous , and powerful globe-trotters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cruised the Aegean in 40–30 B.C. , traveled first class . In April of 32 B.C . the pair sailed from Ephesus to Samos , bringing with them a retinue of popular actors , comedians , and musicians . For three weeks their revels were the talk of Greece : the island resounded with the sounds of pipes and lutes ; there were sumptuous drunken banquets and all-night performances . Cleopatra ’ s souvenirs from Samos included life-size bronze statues of Zeus , Athena , and Heracles taken from the Temple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paintings and thousands of books . Antony bought Greek costumes for himself . Cleopatra was hoping to persuade Antony to get a divorce from his wife in Rome . But he was preoccupied with the upcoming showdown with Octavian ( future emperor Augustus ) in the Adriatic . The couple sailed from Samos to Athens , alternately bickering and making up all the way . The tempestuous affair continued in Athens , where the city raised statues to both lovers on the Acropolis and hailed Cleopatra as the Goddess of Love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riotous drinking bouts , torchlight parades , and outrageous behavior . Antony dressed up in a Dionysos costume . Cleopatra bought tablets of onyx and crystal , had them inscribed with love letters , and sent them to Antony . Antony caused a scandal by caressing her feet in public . The lovers moved their celebrations to the city of Patras , but by September of 30 B.C . the party was over . They both committed suicide after their fleet was defeated by Octavian at Actium in the Gulf of Preveza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not-to-be-missed destinations reads like the itinerary of today ’ s traveler : Athens and its harbor Piraeus , Delphi , Corinth , Sparta , Olympia , and Epidauros . The Olympic Games and those at Nemea , Delphi , and Isthmia continued full bore , and there were Greek theatrical , literary , oratorical , and musical events galore . Local folk dances and festivals drew spectators , and energetic tourists , such as the emperor Hadrian , climbed mountains for the spectacular views . Strabo , the geographer of the first century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place at Sappho ’ s Leap , was very impressed with the sunset panorama visible from the great Acropolis of Corinth . In about AD 160 , Pausanias wrote A Description of Greece , the first guidebook and the model for all subsequent efforts . Pausanias ’ s Greek vacation lasted between 10 and 20 years . Some speculate he began his trip to forget an unhappy love affair , as had Propertius , whose grand tour to Greece was undertaken to “ erase the scar in my heart. ” Pausanias ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still relied on today , is jam-packed with information on history , sights , road conditions , time-saving hints , and curiosities throughout the Greek world . By the time Pausanias began his excursion , the Roman Empire was maintaining and policing roads ( many of which are still extant ) and regulating inns , mules , and carriages in Greece . Carts could be hired in one city and left in the next , like modern rental cars . The emperor Hadrian had widened the road from Athens to Corinth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Via Egnatia connected the northwest coast of Greece with Constantinople . Nero and other investors built inns along the Via Egnatia . Large public latrines were constructed near the Agora in Athens to accommodate visitors . At famous sites , cicerones offered their services and guidebooks were hawked , along with souvenirs and art reproductions . In the Agora , for example , one could buy miniature busts of Socrates near the “ very spot where he drank the hemlock. ” The Oracle at Delphi , once consulted by kings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Guru to the Stars—wealthy private citizens , including Cicero and Nero , now made the journey to have their fortunes told . Other oracles and fortune-telling concessions proliferated—Pausanias described dozens of them , featuring dice , mirrors , lizards , birds , dream interpretations , and magic potions . Pausanias sought out places of historical or romantic interest , and he was always on the lookout for antiquities . Like Herodotus , Pausanias sometimes made a nuisance of himself with his curiosity , pestering and contradicting local guides and arguing with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . He usually traveled by horse cart , going on foot when the route was narrow and “ only fit for an active man. ” Complaints about steep footpaths and bad roads pepper his book , but Pausanias always lets the reader know whether the sight is worth the trouble . Local guides pointed out so many “ Hercules slept here ” places and “ Helen bathed here ” pools that Roman tourists must have pounced on Pausanias ’ s rating system with sighs of relief . His ratings ranged from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” “ I was amazed , ” “ my favorite , ” “ very worthwhile , ” and “ delightful , ” to downright “ silly , ” “ stupid , ” “ utterly idiotic , ” and “ waste of time. ” In his many years of touring Greece , Pausanias was shown countless Helen ’ s Pools and Hercules Passed Here attractions . Epidauros , for instance , boasted an olive tree “ twisted by Hercules himself. ” He admired myriad springs bubbling up where Pegasus Stamped His Hoof ( there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Medusa Was Slain ( Argos had one of these ) , springs where Hera Renewed Her Virginity ( one near Eleusis and another at Nauplion ) , shady glades where Dionysos Stopped for a Drink or Zeus Met a Maiden ( ubiquitous ) , grottoes where Pluto Abducted Persephone to the Underworld ( at Nauplion , Troezen , Hermione , Boeotia , etc . ) , caves of Various Lions Wrestled by Hercules ( Tiryns , Nemea , Mount Kitheron ) , and dozens of rival birthplaces and graves of heroes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patras , Pausanias found “ a delightful place for idling in the summer. ” He noticed that Patras itself had twice as many women as men , and “ if ever women belonged to Aphrodite , they do ! ” These women were expert weavers of cotton and flax , and their decorative hairnets and dresses were popular souvenirs of Patras . Pausanias consulted no fewer than three fortune-telling oracles near here , and he was enchanted by the story of a man who fell hopelessly in love with a faithless mermaid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , the guides assured Pausanias , could make one forget an unhappy passion . “ If true , the river water is worth more to mankind than any amount of money , ” he remarked . His discovery of the delights of the coast near Patras , like Tiberius ’ s fondness for voltas ( evening strolls ) with villagers in Rhodes , and Strabo ’ s ascent of Acrocorinth for the thrilling view , remind us that , besides the glorious antiquities and stirring history , it is this glimpse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique out-of-the-way experience , that every visitor hopes to treasure as a personal souvenir . By the third century A.D. , worsening economic and social conditions , not to mention barbarian hordes , made gadding about the Mediterranean for the pure fun of it simply too adventurous for most people . After three centuries of relatively safe travel guaranteed by the “ Roman peace , ” more than a thousand years would pass before philhellenes would again make Grand Tours to Greece to satisfy curiosity and to seek history and adventure .

The report includes findings from 2020 , a year in which most governments in the West , and a large number in the rest of the world , invested heavily in “ Stay Home , Stay Safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes or engage in any outdoor activity as a means of preventing the spread of Chinese coronavirus . Governments around the world , including many local governments in America , closed down some of the most important sites of physical activity for adults and children – gyms and playgrounds – going as far as to prosecute some gym owners for defying lockdown restrictions and arresting parents for giving their children fresh air . “ Your hip hop yoga class can fucking wait , ” pop star Ariana Grande advised fans in 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wednesday ’ s W.H.O .

It did , however , condemn school closures as detrimental to children ’ s health . “ School closures denied many children one of the opportunities they had to be active in communities where options for physical activity , sport and recreation are absent or inaccessible , ” the report detailed . “ The response to the pandemic also revealed the importance of providing opportunities that enable everyone to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender , income , ethnicity or physical ability .

"By all accounts, liberalism is in a state of crisis globally. Liberalism finds itself especially under threat in its contemporary “homeland” — the U.S of the post-2016 Trump era, prompting a once unthinkable question among concerned American intellectuals of different political persuasions: Is liberalism worth saving? Although much of the discourse surrounding liberalism’s contemporary crisis emanates from the U.S., it reaches far beyond American borders and manifests itself in the palpable ascendence of right-wing authoritarian governments around the world (propped up, in some cases, by openly fascist parties in power) that are led by “strongmen.” These include (until recently) Donald Trump in the United States and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, and to this day, Narendra Modi in India, Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Jaros?aw Kaczy?ski in Poland, among others. Orbán and Kaczy?ski, once lionized by Cold War liberals and neoconservatives alike for their anti-communist credentials, have increasingly embraced the politics of “illiberal democracy.” The crux of illiberal democracy is that democracy is reducible to majoritarian politics, including adherence to seemingly traditional values, which does not extend to the corollary protection of individual rights as demanded by liberal legality. Of course, none of this prevents these strongmen from invoking “law and order” to abrogate hard-won rights while stifling their opponents at every turn. The invocation of illiberal democracy has the unintentional consequence of reminding us that liberalism and democracy did not always go hand in hand, and indeed that the two pillars remain in a fraught relationship well into the present. Classical liberalism and its subsequent heirs, which champion private property and freedom of contract, carry a brutal “counter-history” (to use Domenico Losurdo’s term) of exclusion and domination, replete with slavery, colonial genocide and an enduring legacy of disenfranchisement. Of course, this counter-history does not concern illiberal democrats in the least, even though the modern histories of their respective polities have also been shaped by disenfranchisement and genocide. At this juncture, one might think it ill-advised to tackle the global crisis of liberalism by drawing anything from the Marxist tradition, least of all from the writings of Karl Marx. According to the usual mainstream refrain, didn’t those teachings contribute to the politics of totalitarianism, which showed utter contempt for human life, not to mention running roughshod over such liberal ideals as justice, legality and rights? Indeed, socialists must genuinely reckon with the Soviet legacy and its monstrous warts, but it may still pay to learn from Marx in a context where the struggle for democracy and rights was critically at stake, by which I mean the European Revolutions of 1848 in which Marx was an active participant."
""""""" Joe Biden isn ’ t floundering alone in the current culture war . The Democratic Party ’ s brand has chosen the wrong side of some hot-button issues , ranging from “ soft on crime ” policies to COVID-19 shutdowns to critical race theory . It has gotten so bad that , according to Politico , the Democratic Party ’ s congressional campaign arm is warning their candidates that “ they risk losing significant ground to Republicans in the midterms. ” If Dems don ’ t adequately respond to Republican attacks on these culture-war issues , party operatives say “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generic ballot balloons to 14 points from 4 points ... ” This could be the difference between a wave and a tsunami . It ’ s tempting to dismiss the culture war as ginned-up or phony . But the problem with brushing off the culture war writ large is that culture is everything . Democrats should not dismiss people ’ s concerns about their culture being threatened as beneath them because it encompasses a person ’ s way of life—including their institutions , worldview , and sacred values . Native Americans struggled against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives but their way of life . Today , conservationists fight against overdevelopment to conserve not just their environment but their culture . There is nothing inherently ignoble about this , except to those who view these fights as hindering progress . When it comes to “ social progress , ” we call these folks progressives . Now , because some forms of change , like most technological advancements , are both salutary and inexorable , progress has a positive connotation . But when change is either perceived as harmful to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is radically thrust upon people , you can expect a visceral backlash . Such is the case in American politics today . You might wonder how the Democratic Party preemptively and prematurely picked a culture war fight they couldn ’ t win . I believe it ’ s because a ) ideology is blinding , and b ) they assumed a “ coalition of the ascendant ” would counter any attrition that might come from working-class voters defecting . ( This is not an endorsement of “ replacement theory. ” ) The latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . For the purposes of this discussion , I ’ m more interested in the former . The loudest voices on the left today are very online–young , educated “ woke ” white progressives . As Democratic data guru David Shor noted last year , “ as Democrats have traded non-college-educated voters for college-educated ones , white liberals ’ share of voice and clout in the Democratic Party has gone up. ” “ And since white voters are sorting [ based ] on ideology more than nonwhite voters , ” Shor continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a situation where white liberals are more left wing than Black and Hispanic Democrats on pretty much every issue… ” In their minds , they are on the right side of history ; and that history must be constantly progressing . And because progressives are always pushing for progress , they are the aggressors in the culture war . Or , as Kevin Drum , the liberal journalist formerly with Washington Monthly and Mother Jones , put it last year , “ It is not conservatives who have turned American politics into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals. ” That ’ s because , according to Drum ( who charted changes in public attitudes on issues like abortion , guns , gay marriage , taxes , and religion ) , “ Since 1994 , Democrats have moved left far more than Republicans have moved right. ” Not surprisingly , this shift is most acutely felt in rural and small-town America , which tends to be more non-college white and culturally conservative . “ The [ Democratic ] party ’ s brand is so toxic in the small towns 100 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us , “ that some liberals have removed bumper stickers and yard signs and refuse to acknowledge publicly their party affiliation. ” Progressives sometimes lament the fact that working-class and/or rural Americans vote against their self-interest , by which they generally mean economic self-interest . To the degree their premise is correct , it comes down to culture . The materialists can ’ t fathom how intangibles like honor , respect , tradition , loyalty , religion , status , or identity so often trump pecuniary concerns . The truth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their presumed self-interest to preserve their way of life , they will sometimes even die for it . This can be noble ( as is the case with a war hero willing to die for his country ) or even silly ( think of the Americans who were so wedded to the anti-vax tribe that they would rather die than get a vaccine ) . Of course , sometimes these culture war issues are not so esoteric . In some cases , the worry is not about losing one ’ s way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s life . Progressives can try to dismiss the “ defund the police ” phrase as a culture war slogan , but violent crime is a serious issue . What is more , it ’ s plausible that some of the problem is the result of a left-wing political culture where district attorneys are increasingly soft on crime and police officers feel like we have abandoned them . The crime issue isn ’ t going away , and the latest front in this ongoing culture war seems to be bail reform . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , this week we saw the man who allegedly stabbed a 35-year-old Asian woman to death in New York City released without bail , and a local Black Lives Matter chapter posting bail for a man accused of attempting to murder a Louisville , Kentucky , mayoral candidate . “ Part of the political problem for Dems is that they ’ re months behind in appreciating how damaging their positions at the time are , ” Kraushaar tweeted . It might be too obvious to say that the Democratic Party had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looming electoral losses in the coming November midterms .

""""""" Europe is facing an existential crisis – having sufficient affordable heat and electricity this winter for its populations . People are not only suffering ahead of winter ’ s arrival , but the likelihood of people dying because of this crisis is growing . A similar challenge is being faced in many U.S. power markets . Can the worst of the potential outcomes be avoided , or are we on a path that will only worsen for our residents ? In May of this year , Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) commissioner Mark Christie said the country was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That claim was supported by a report from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation declaring that the central and upper Midwest ( MIZO ) , Texas ( ERCOT ) , and California ( CASIO ) power markets were staring down the barrel of blackouts . While they are yet to materialize broadly , the challenges facing regional power grids remain serious issues for the foreseeable future . Managing the “ clean energy transition ” while keeping the lights on requires the skills of a juggler . Balancing the many demands , often coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is room to address only one is a talent that comes from years of practice and trial-and-error . In this case , mistakes can be life-threatening . In late 2021 , Gordon van Welie , president and CEO of Independent System Operator – New England ( ISO-NE ) warned of potential blackouts throughout New England if the upcoming winter was colder than forecast . He told reporters they were cautiously watching “ [ three ] variables that could put the region in a more precarious position than past winters and force the ISO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and including controlled power outages. ” Van Welie cited the following variables he and his operations team were watching closely . First was “ how much natural gas will be available for gas generators during cold weather. ” This was an acknowledgment that getting adequate natural gas supplies into New England was challenging because of pipeline constraints imposed by neighboring New York and New Jersey that have blocked capacity expansions . The second variable was low storage levels of heating oil and liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) supplies . The final variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” was the weather . Even though a mild winter was predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , van Welie said , “ even a mild winter forecast does not preclude extended cold snaps . Such prolonged cold snaps would heighten the probability that emergency measures would have to be taken to keep the system from collapsing. ” Fortunately , a crisis was avoided , but the issues surrounding these three variables have not been erased . They may be intensifying due to the Russia/Ukraine war and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic oil and gas industry . Recently , U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm wrote to Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker . “ I urge you to consider what additional steps you can take in the coming weeks to improve preparedness , including using any legislative or executive tools at your disposal , working with responsible state agencies to require increased storage levels , and encouraging industry to voluntarily prioritize increasing gasoline and distillate inventories at this pivotal period of heightened risk , ” she wrote . East Coast gasoline inventories are at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while diesel supply is roughly 64 % below the five-year average storage level . Given an extended winter storm impacting the East Coast and New England regions , home heating oil supply chains could be disrupted . Oil is a key fuel source for ISO-NE in managing the region ’ s power grid and for home heating during the winter . While the issue of avoiding blackouts for ISO-NE is receiving greater attention , the paths the various states have elected to travel in decarbonizing their economies increase the risk of blackouts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keynote speaker at the summer WIRES conference . His talk was titled “ The Four Pillars Needed for a Successful Clean Energy Transition , and the Critical Role of Transmission Infrastructure. ” The pillars are : • “ Significant amounts of clean energy to power the economy with a greener grid ” • Balancing resources that keep electricity supply and demand in equilibrium • Energy adequacy—a dependable energy supply chain and/or a robust energy reserve to manage through extended periods of severe weather or energy supply constraints • Robust transmission to integrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers across New England Peculiarly , van Welie made no mention of affordability . Securing his pillars depends on reasonable cost . However , as we are seeing in Europe , the number of people involuntarily forced into “ energy poverty ” by skyrocketing electricity and natural gas ( heating ) prices is growing exponentially . According to the European Union , “ ‘ Energy poverty ’ is a widespread problem across Europe , as between 50 and 125 million people are unable to afford proper indoor thermal comfort. ” In the U.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British households will face poverty this winter after paying energy bills . The End Fuel Poverty Coalition ( EFPC ) estimates that about 10.5 million U.K. households will be in energy poverty during the first three months of 2023 . After paying for energy , these families ’ incomes will fall below the poverty line defined as a household income of less than 60 % of the U.K. median , which was £31,000 ( $ 37,500 ) in 2021 . The estimate is based on energy cost estimates from research firm Cornwall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills hitting £3,582 ( $ 4,335 ) a year by October , and rising to £4,266 ( $ 5,163 ) from January , roughly equal to about £355 ( $ 430 ) a month . Although many may think the New England region is immune to an energy crisis past summer , winter peak demand is the issue . It can cripple the region when and if temperatures drop very low . Add in a winter storm – a Nor ’ easter or a blizzard – and you have a recipe for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding the alarm about power adequacy in the New England region last winter , there had been periodic less dire warnings ahead of prior winters . The warnings became more urgent last week with the release of a “ Draft ISO/EDC/LDC Problem Statement and Call to Action on LNG and Energy Adequacy ” ahead of the upcoming FERC New England Winter Gas-Electric Forum . ( More on this later . ) In his WIRES talk , van Welie highlighted how the ISO-NE grid fuel mix had changed over time . Between 2000 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % to 0.2 % of electrical energy production for the grid , while coal use went from 18 % to 0.5 % . Nuclear fell slightly from 31 % to 22 % , largely due to plant retirements , and renewables increased by 50 % from 8 % to 12 % of the total . The biggest change was for natural gas , which went from supplying 15 % to 53 % –a huge shift . The problem for the region is that dispatchable generating capacity has shrunk . Since 2013 , 7,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired or announced plans to retire . Most of that capacity has been coal , oil , and nuclear . Van Welie estimates that 5,000 MW of oil generation is at risk of retirement . He pointed out that retirements occur on schedule while new generating resources are often delayed , putting pressure on the grid . Additional grid pressure comes from its heavy dependence on imported LNG and oil that provides peaking energy supplies in the winter . These supply chains become uncertain during extreme weather conditions that create reliability risks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how quickly generating capacity is changing on ISO-NE . In a slide for his talk , van Welie showed how the future fuel capacity mix is projected to change . In 2017 , the grid ’ s projected fuel mix called for natural gas to provide 48 % , wind 44 % , and solar 6 % of the estimated 13,250 MW . But a recent forecast update sees natural gas at only 3 percent with wind at 59 % of the 28,704 MW of nameplate capacity to be added , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % . The huge wind component relies on new offshore projects , primarily off Massachusetts . Substantially less dispatchable energy in the future ISO-NE grid raises serious questions about energy adequacy . The future for the grid will be interesting given the following two slides about projected electricity demand and how peak demand switches from summer to winter . Van Welie ’ s opening slide ( July presentation ) shows ISO-NE ’ s forecast of energy demand from 2022 to 2031 based on the prediction of additional EVs and electric heating in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Department of Energy ’ s Alternative Fuels Data Center , there were 101,400 electric vehicles ( battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric ) in the six New England states in 2021 . The ISO-NE forecast calls for over 1.5 million electric vehicles in the region that will need to be charged , thus the dramatic increase in transportation electricity demand . The implications of the green energy trends highlighted in the above chart , if carried through to 2050 are that the peak electricity demand in New England shifts from summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart . Moreover , the growth in the winter peak is dramatic , especially by 2050 , compared to summer demand . The winter demand peak represents a doubling of the current gross generating capacity . That increase comes from heating electrification , which is a load that can not be compromised because of its potential for creating a human disaster . Van Welie concluded his WIRES presentation with the following points : • ISO-NE needs to plan to ensure energy adequacy to fully support the region ’ s transition to clean energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating sectors . • New England has vast renewable energy potential , primarily from wind , that the states want to tap for their decarbonization efforts . ( He also cited the potential of tapping additional hydropower from Quebec , but that adds to the grid ’ s risk from both greater imports of power and the need to transport it from Canada to New England power markets . ) • ISO-NE will ultimately require massive transmission investments to facilitate the clean energy transition . Estimates are that the grid must invest billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are issues with siting and cost allocation that needs to be overcome for the clean energy transition to be successful in New England . The projects necessary to add the required generating capacity and transmission lines to move the power around the region are complicated , costly , and have extended construction times . As mentioned earlier , the ISO-NE has issued a draft problem statement about LNG and energy adequacy in advance of a major regional and federal energy planning meeting . The two issues highlight the risk of early closure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently planned . The following statement from the ISO-NE paper describes the issue . We have no idea how long ISO-NE anticipates keeping the Everett LNG Facility operating , but we suspect it will be many years . ISO-NE continues working on finding solutions to manage energy adequacy while facilitating the region ’ s clean energy transition . Its efforts have been done through the Future Grid Reliability Study , which involved collaboration between ISO-NE , the energy offices of the various New England states , and NEPOOL . Since 2005 , NEPOOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent , FERC-approved stakeholder advisory group on all matters relating to the competitive wholesale market rules and transmission tariff design . Involving NEPOOL is a recognition of the challenge of managing state environmental and power offices and plans with ISO-NE ’ s needs and responsibilities along with FERC rules in developing energy solutions . As part of the planning , the study showed that approximately 73-90 gigawatts ( GW ) of wind , solar , and battery storage will be needed by 2040 to ensure the reliability of the energy systems depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In summarizing its draft position paper to help focus the discussion at the FERC session in early September , ISO-NE wrote the following . New Englanders are largely unaware that the light at the end of the clean energy transition tunnel is not a train , it ’ s a blackout . Those who are reading the newspapers and financial press about sharply higher electricity and natural gas prices in Europe , increased energy poverty , and the potential for social unrest should be alarmed .

"Governor Kathy Hochul signed a legislative package Wednesday that includes strengthening early voting practices.

The legislation also enhances electoral education, requiring the state’s Board of Elections to provide a training program for poll workers."
"Every time someone mentions the possibility of a leftwing electoral alternative to the Labour party, I am immediately reminded of a scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, in which Dennis, the Lord of Swamp Castle, explains to his son Herbert: “Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show ’em. It sank into the swamp. So, I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So, I built a third one. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp.” The Socialist Labour party was founded in 1996 by Arthur Scargill, hero of Britain’s most important post-war industrial dispute. It has never won an election of any kind. The Socialist Alliance was formed in 1999 and collapsed four years later, leaving no electoral footprint. Respect grew out of the movement against the Iraq war, but gradually became a personal vehicle for George Galloway and was deregistered in 2016. Since its foundation in 2010, the Trade Union and Socialist Coalition (Tusc) has never kept a deposit in a general election. By and large, first past the post creates two-party systems. To come close to power, new parties must reset voting behaviours and displace establishment parties. At Westminster, this has happened once, in 1922, when Labour overtook the Liberals to become the UK’s main party of opposition. The task took two decades, and was the result of a much longer-term shift in the size and confidence of the industrial working class. Social Democratic and Labour parties broke through across western Europe at around the same time."
"In less than two weeks, Argentinians will head to the polls to elect a new president. While always an important event, this election cycle feels particularly weighty. August’s primaries defied expectations and seemed to signal voters’ increasing wariness with the current political environment. Our visit to Argentina in July left us with a similar impression, as our talks with individuals on the ground gave us a sense of frustration with the nation’s politics. Given Argentina’s long-standing rule under Peronist leaders, we see a potential change in political ideology as transformational for the country’s outlook. This could include reining in spending, allowing for a free-floating currency, reducing or eliminating import controls, allowing for increased International Monetary Fund (IMF) cooperation, and/or generally boosting investor confidence, which could in turn attract capital and potentially result in the country regaining its emerging market designation.

"The Biden administration is facing criticism for its decision to outsource a key part of its climate agenda to a foreign non-profit tied to a behemoth left-wing dark money network. President Biden announced late last year, during a speech at a global climate summit, that his White House would issue requirements for federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, share climate-related financial risks and set emissions reduction targets. The regulations, though, will leverage criteria set by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), a U.K.-based group linked to left-wing, dark money funding streams. ""The federal government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers,"" said House Science, Space, and Technology Investigations and Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., during a hearing last week. ""However, that is exactly the case in this instance."""

"House Republicans appear poised to launch an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), who called an impeachment inquiry a “natural step forward” during a Fox News appearance late last month, is reportedly strategizing with other top Republicans about how to open one by the end of September, which would likely focus on the business dealings of Biden’s son Hunter during the Obama administration. House congressional probes of the subject have generated plenty of content for right-wing outlets. But even members of the GOP caucus acknowledge it has uncovered little to no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden. As one House Republican (anonymously) put it: “There’s no evidence that Joe Biden got money, or that Joe Biden, you know, agreed to do something so that Hunter could get money. There’s just no evidence of that. And they can’t impeach without that evidence. And I don’t I don’t think the evidence exists.” Absent that proof, political commentators rightfully warn, moving forward with impeachment “would carry considerable risk for the Republican Party.” McCarthy’s folly is a sign of the hammerlock Fox News has on the Republican Party. The right-wing propaganda network’s stars have long demanded a Biden impeachment as both retaliation and political cover for Donald Trump’s various impeachments and criminal indictments. Since those Fox commentators wield more power within the GOP than most of its putative leaders do, a Biden impeachment inquiry has seemed inevitable, with the only question being what they’d end up backfilling as its rationale. And somehow, they’ve settled on taking a shot with the Hunter Biden minutiae they’ve all spent years feverishly rehashing (but that no one can parse without a PhD in Sean Hannity Studies)."

""""""" Oakland , CA — While the question of “ Who will build the roads ? ” is typically presented as a problem that only government can solve , all too often , government does nothing to solve it , or , in some instances , makes the problem worse . Every election year we listen to the politicians all preach about the crumbling infrastructure and how they will fix it . And , every year after each election , the American people never see those promises come true . Because the state is notoriously horrible at doing the jobs they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oakland , California has taken it upon themselves to fix the problem . Because fixing potholes without the approval of the state is illegal , these self-proclaimed “ pothole vigilantes ” strike under the cover of darkness in the dead of the night . The group has a GoFundMe account set up and resident of Oakland donate to it . Folks with dangerous potholes on their streets can then request that the vigilantes fix it — and that is exactly what they do . What started as a mission between two friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gained national attention and dozens of volunteers . In a short film posted this month to Facebook , residents of Oakland expressed their praise for the group in the comments below it . They have to do this because our government is corrupt and fails us all . It is in our hands to make things right for ourselves . Government officials only care about making money while plunging us deeper in debt . These guys are REAL ones . This is great ! I ’ m thrilled that people take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ’ m disheartened that our tax dollars and government neglect these issues . It costs so much less to prevent and patch these problems than it does to deal with lawsuits and harm caused by their existence in the first place . thank you for the time and effort you guys are contributing to Oakland It doesn ’ t unnoticed . Makes me wonder if I ’ ve driven over filled potholes that you guys have fixed I ’ m sure I have . The work by this group can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need the government “ to build the roads , ” projects like this dispel that claim by showing that work can get done through voluntary measures and without theft via taxation . Despite the fact that many people believe roads would cease to exist if they were not funded by the government , private charities and businesses have actually been able to serve this function in isolated circumstances when they had the freedom to do so . As TFTP reported in 2018 , Domino ’ s Pizza took to solving pothole problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pothole repairs at pavingforpizza.com . So far , they have gone to all 50 states and repaired roads in dozens of cities . Another perfect example of this very situation was in the news a few years ago on Hawaii ’ s Kauai Island , when private citizens performed a $ 4 million road repair job for free—in just 8 days . When a need arises in a community , people naturally come together and take care of what needs to be done ; they don ’ t need someone forcing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t have to do this , but when it gets to a state level , it just gets so bureaucratic , something that took us eight days would have taken them years , ” said Troy Martin of Martin Steel , who donated machinery and steel for the repairs . “ So we got together—the community—and we got it done. ” In one Michigan community , people took these matters into their own hands instead of sitting around and waiting for the failed government to do it . In 2015 , residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of Detroit—started an effort to fill in potholes and repair roads themselves . Critics of taxation are often asked , “ who will build the roads ? ” Apparently , there are those who believe that in the absence of the state , humanity will suddenly become incapable of laying down a dirt path or connecting roads into an interstate freeway . These people discuss the creation of government roads as if the construction was simply due to the kindness of government and not made possible by the theft of taxation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is collect money from private citizens under the threat of violence , then use that money to employ those very same citizens to build infrastructure . The reality is that the people could build infrastructure themselves for less money if they coordinated with neighbors and other communities and they would do a far better job at it . """""""

"Adjust Share For decades, New Hampshire has generated brisk and gratifying drama with its first-in-the-nation presidential primary. The Granite State momentously destroyed a presidency in 1968, when the Minnesota senator Eugene McCarthy ran against President Lyndon Johnson on an antiwar platform. Johnson had been so confident of his renomination that he had not initially deigned to enter the New Hampshire race, while other leading Democratic politicians, including Robert F. Kennedy Sr., remained aloof, fearful of challenging the president despite his mounting unpopularity during the Vietnam War. Thus, McCarthy was the only major Democrat on the ballot. When the fervor behind his campaign revealed the senator’s surging support, Johnson hurriedly mobilized a write-in effort, which duly yielded him a 50 percent share against McCarthy’s 42—a poor enough showing for a sitting president to embolden Kennedy to enter the race four days later, and for Johnson to announce his retirement from the race two weeks after that. For Joe Biden, the New Hampshire primary’s history is entirely hateful. In 2020, the contest came close to terminating his hopes for the White House. Running out of money, his staff deflated by the results in Iowa, his public image scarred with mishaps (including an unpleasant jibe in which he called a questioner a “lying, dog-faced pony soldier”), he finished fifth, with just 8.4 percent of the vote. Fleeing the state before the polls closed, he moved to the more congenial territory of South Carolina, where black voters, generally his most dependable constituency, set him on the path to the White House."

That was just one week after Trump praised Majewski and his landscaping at an Ohio rally for Vance . “ There ’ s never been an endorsement in American history that has the political punch that President Trump ’ s endorsement has , ” said Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-Ohio ) . At the moment , Vance ’ s flailing-to-sailing campaign is a case study in Trump ’ s ability to change the game for a candidate down the stretch . Vance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , but Trump ’ s mid-April endorsement plus big spending by a Peter Thiel-backed super PAC vaulted him over his primary rivals Josh Mandel , Mike Gibbons , Matt Dolan and Jane Timken . Six years ago , retiring Sen . Rob Portman ( R-Ohio ) significantly outpaced Trump in 2016 as he romped to reelection in Ohio , even after rescinding his endorsement of the then-presidential nominee . Things looked much different this time around : Portman ’ s preferred candidate Timken ended up in fifth place , torched by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s ( R-Ohio ) impeachment vote that lost her Trump ’ s potential backing . “ I told you the endorsement was going to matter . And it did , ” Portman said of Trump backing Vance . “ He has a very high approval rating among Republican primary voters. ” It also didn ’ t hurt that in Ohio “ you had two other frontrunner candidates who almost beat each other up on stage , ” quipped Sen. Shelley Moore Capito ( R-W.Va. ) , referring to a televised clash between Gibbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio won ’ t end debate over Trump ’ s GOP sway after four chaotic years in the White House ; in fact , his pull will be tested on a weekly basis this spring . And if he can replicate his performance in Ohio in most races , there will be little doubt that Trump ’ s blessing is determinative in open seats . “ When Trump endorsed , Vance was in fourth place . And he rocketed to the front on the shoulders of Trump ’ s endorsement , ” said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who campaigned for Mandel in Ohio . “ It has been obvious for a long time that he has enormous influence in the party , that Republicans strongly support President Trump , and they care about his leadership. ” Still , Cruz said he wouldn ’ t be dissuaded from campaigning for Republican hopeful David McCormick in Pennsylvania ’ s Senate race just because Trump ’ s endorsement cost Mandel the primary . As to whether Trump is the frontrunner for the 2024 nomination , Cruz said of his former 2016 rival : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frontrunner in every circumstance. ” After 18 months of build-up , the primaries are now coming fast , starting next week with a West Virginia battle between Republican Reps. David McKinley and Trump-backed Rep. Alex Mooney , as well as a Nebraska gubernatorial race in which Trump endorsed Charles Herbster , who — like the former president — has faced accusations of sexual assault . After that comes open Senate GOP primaries in Pennsylvania , where Trump endorsed TV personality Mehmet Oz over business executive McCormick , and North Carolina , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gov . Pat McCrory and former Rep. Mark Walker . Trump ’ s also struggling to dislodge Idaho Gov . Brad Little . Then comes Georgia , where Gov . Brian Kemp has a steady lead over Trump-backed former Sen. David Perdue and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger squares off against Trump ally Rep. Jody Hice . Trump yanked his Senate endorsement of Rep. Mo Brooks in Alabama after Brooks ’ numbers sank down the stretch , raising eyebrows among Senate Republicans . He ’ s expected to endorse one of Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the next month . Trump will struggle to win all of those races . And his allies are hoping Trump would be a gracious loser — a high bar for a man who still refuses to admit he lost to Biden . “ If one of his preferred candidates loses down the road , I hope he ’ ll do the same thing everybody else should do , which is get behind the person that won , ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) , who called Trump ’ s endorsement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed that “ 70 percent of the people voted for somebody else ” in Ohio . In Georgia ’ s Senate race , Trump essentially ended the Republican primary before it even started by anointing Herschel Walker to challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock . Republicans have barely lifted a finger to try and stop the scandal-plagued Walker given his popularity among GOP voters , reasoning that if they are going to win the seat they have to do it with Trump ’ s candidate . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans have only sought to protect Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R-Alaska ) from Trump ’ s wrath after he endorsed primary challenger Kelly Tshibaka in Alaska . He ’ s stopped trying to topple Senate Minority Whip John Thune ( R-S.D . ) , perplexing the No . 2 GOP leader . Asked why Trump has gone quiet in his reelection race , Thune responded : “ Good question . I don ’ t have any answer to that. ” Sen. Mike Rounds ( R-S.D . ) offered one explanation : that Thune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ’ d be difficult to beat under any circumstance . And in high-profile Senate races , Trump ’ s been relatively strategic . He endorsed Vance and Oz late to help push them over the top and has stayed away from scandal-plagued former Missouri Gov . Eric Greitens ’ Senate bid . Trump ’ s also aligned with the deep-pocketed Club for Growth to help vault Budd into the lead in North Carolina , two factors that when combined “ have a pretty big impact , ” said National Republican Senatorial Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That pro-Budd alliance comes after Trump and the Club supported different candidates in Ohio . But even where Trump hasn ’ t endorsed , the GOP primaries are mostly about Trump anyway . “ He ’ s ramping up his activity . He ’ s doing more rallies , he ’ s getting more involved in these races , ” Hawley said . “ He doesn ’ t have to be involved in these races . Because everyone ’ s claiming his mantle anyway . ” """""""

"Too bad Donald Trump won’t attend the second Republican presidential primary debate next week at the Ronald Reagan Library. His friends and enemies in the media will miss him and the high ratings he automatically generates, but he’s leading by a huge margin in the polls and he doesn’t need the TV time or media attention. And though nothing he ever says at this point in his political life can hurt him among his 74 million followers, Trump figures any minor benefit from being in a primary debate is not worth the risk of having some hopeless longshot show him up on stage."
"The Republican primary to challenge Democrat Jon Tester for his U.S. Senate seat in 2024 has a new contender: former Secretary of State and Public Service Commission Chairman Brad Johnson. The Helena Republican, who filed his candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday, cited electability as one factor that distinguishes him from Bozeman businessman Tim Sheehy, a political newcomer, and Rep. Matt Rosendale, who lost to Tester in the 2018 general election. Sheehy announced his candidacy in June after being recruited by top Republicans in Washington, D.C. Rosendale, the congressman from Montana’s eastern district, hasn’t announced but is widely believed to be planning a Senate run. His congressional office last week helped to stoke those rumors, describing him in a statement as “the strongest candidate to beat Jon Tester.”"

""""""" A Uvalde coroner is haunted by identifying the bodies of children and an old friend UVALDE , Texas — Eulalio `` Lalo '' Diaz , Jr. is n't always on call , but it was his turn to be at the helm as Uvalde 's Justice of the Peace on the day a gunman massacred 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in the deadliest school shooting in state history . The county is so small that the justice on call also acts as Uvalde 's de facto coroner . He does n't expect he 'll ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck ... my bad luck , '' Diaz told NPR . `` But I would n't wish it on anyone . '' Sitting in his office at the Uvalde County Courthouse , across the street from a makeshift memorial in the town square , Diaz recalled the shock of walking into the site of the slaughter that included so many small children whose parents and grandparents he 's known for years , and one of his own high school classmates . `` I know both teachers , their husbands , '' he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kids ' families or their grandparents . It 's just that type of community and it 's close , '' Diaz said . Despite the connections , Diaz explained , `` It was my job to identify the bodies . '' Because there is no local medical examiner 's office , the Justice of the Peace regularly steps in as the county coroner , in addition to presiding over misdemeanor court cases , small civil disputes , and marriage ceremonies . Last week , that meant that Diaz was the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put names to the small , ravaged bodies of mostly 9 and 10 year old children before they could be autopsied . `` It 's just the most devastating news you 'd want to hear , '' he said , shaking his head . Nothing could have prepared him for what awaited at the school The case was so grisly , and so unlike anything he 'd ever had to face , that it required extra help from the Bexar County Medical Examiner in San Antonio . ( Up until last Tuesday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualties that he had ever dealt with was when an 18-wheeler hit and killed a family of four a few years ago ) . While he waited for the medical examiner to make the drive to Uvalde , Diaz tried to steel himself . `` For two hours , I sat there , preparing myself and getting ready for the scene we 're about to see ... because you know it 's going to be a tough scene , '' he said . There was an inner monologue running through his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : `` You have to be strong and you have to maintain professionalism because the families are counting on you now . '' But nothing could have prepared him for what was waiting for him inside . He saw first-hand what a semi-automatic can do to kids When they entered the school , he and the medical examiner found that the first responders had moved the bodies – separating the deceased from the wounded – in order to get to those who needed medical assistance . `` So when we got there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial two rooms plus two other rooms , '' Diaz said , adding that they `` went room by room getting the plan together on what we were going to need to make sure that we identified everybody correctly . '' Diaz did not describe the scene in detail . Instead , he said , `` It 's something you never want to see and it 's something you do n't , you can not , prepare for . It 's a picture that 's going to stay in my head forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like for it to stay . '' He says he has no intention of ever sharing exactly what he saw . The AR-15 , which is the weapon used by the gunman at Robb Elementary , is designed to blow targets apart . It 's a weapon built for war . And when fired into a human adult body , its bullets travel with such fierce velocity that they can decapitate a person , or leave a body looking `` like a grenade went off in there , '' as Peter Rhee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona , told Wired . The carnage the weapon leaves behind has become a signature of school shootings and other mass shootings across the country . Unfortunately , Diaz has now seen first-hand what such a weapon can do to children with small bones and limbs , which made the process of identifying them even more agonizing . He found an old classmate among the victims Diaz had to confront another chilling discovery : among the dead , lying still on the floor of the same elementary school he attended as a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garcia , one of the two teachers who was killed that day . `` She was one year younger than me through junior high and high school , and I knew her husband , '' he said , referring to Joe Garcia , who died of a heart attack two days later . `` He was a year older than me . They had been high school sweethearts . I 've known them all my life . '' He knows he 'll need help to process the trauma Holding his head in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long day , Diaz said the scene will haunt him for the rest of his life . He admits that he 's probably still operating on adrenaline , and the demands of the situation are keeping him so busy that he does n't have time to think . But he said that when he gets opportunity to come up for air , he plans to seek some sort of help to process the trauma of what he has witnessed . It is not uncommon for people who are tasked with identifying bodies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mass shootings like the one in Uvalde can cause long-lasting trauma `` because you keep remembering , '' he said . For now , he 's turning to his family and friends , and other Justices of the Peace , who he says are the only other people who understand what he 's going through : `` They 've lived it . They understand it . They 've seen some scenes that have been horrific . '' """""""

He has zero chance of winning the race,” Lundy said, trying to position himself as an alternative to the party favorites in next month’s election. A look at the Republican-heavy field for Louisiana governor might lead one to support Lundy’s take on the situation for the top Democrat in the race.

"For three years now, I’ve had a recurring dream. I am walking into the British Parliament, which seems to have become a cathedral. Passing beneath coffered ceilings, Gothic wallpaper, and sinuous brass work, I arrive at a marble version of the debating chamber, in which I can see my sometimes-antagonist, the Conservative member of Parliament Jacob Rees-Mogg, lying in what appears to be a bishop’s surplice on one of the pews. When I step in to join my other colleagues, a large man in a tailcoat intercepts me, indicates courteously that this place is no longer for me, and escorts me out. I had thought that I was reconciled to my break with Britain’s Conservative Party. My dreams suggest otherwise. That break was sudden. Four years ago, Boris Johnson became prime minister. Almost overnight, the liberal-centrist tradition of the Conservative Party, which I had championed, was replaced by a right-wing, anti-immigrant platform for populists who reveled in stoking culture wars. The new prime minister threatened that MPs who tried to block his hard-Brexit proposals would be expelled from the party. Twenty-one of us chose to do so. He was true to his word: We all lost our seats. The party that I had served in Parliament for nearly a decade, and latterly for several years as a government minister, disinherited me. Friends turned against me."
""""""" What Europe 's ban of Russian oil could mean for energy markets – and your gas prices It 's going to get even more volatile in energy markets – and hence for gasoline prices . Crude prices jumped on Wednesday after the European Union proposed a ban on oil imports from Russia as part of a new round of sanctions targeting the country after its invasion of Ukraine . The details are still being hammered out , and the proposal needs to be unanimously agreed upon by the 27 members of the bloc before going into effect . Brent crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped more than 4 % on the news and was trading at around $ 110 a barrel . Here 's what the proposed EU ban could mean for global oil markets and gasoline prices in the U.S. How much impact will there be on oil markets ? Crude prices will likely go even higher still after already surging following Russia 's invasion of Ukraine . Europe is hugely dependent on Russian oil imports . It gets about a quarter of its oil from Russia , by far the biggest single source of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find other buyers like India for the crude , it 's unlikely that Russia will be able to sell the entire allotment that would usually go to Europe . Heavy sanctions have made some traditional buyers reluctant to deal with Russia . And as part of its latest proposal , the EU is also seeking to ban European ships from transporting Russian oil . Ultimately it 's expected that an EU ban on Russian oil imports will result in a loss of 2 million barrels a day from Russia . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be cautious when the region was considering its oil ban given that Russia could make up the loss of revenue from sales to the EU through higher crude prices . There are factors that could contain oil prices , however . Lockdowns in China to deal with an outbreak of Covid-19 cases are expected to reduce global demand for crude , though it 's hard to say how long the measures will last . What does the EU ban mean for gasoline prices ? European citizens will be hit hard for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's hard to see any relief in sight to gas prices . After all , what consumers pay at the pump is most directly affected by the global price of crude . When the price of oil spiked following Russia 's invasion of Ukraine , the average price of gasoline in the U.S. shot up above $ 4 a gallon and has remained there since , according to data from the American Automobile Association . The U.S. is also approaching the summer season , when traditionally more people take to the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is the Biden administration 's release of emergency oil from the strategy oil reserve . The U.S. is releasing about a million barrels a day and will tap up to 180 million barrels . Al Salazar , senior vice president with Enverus Intelligence , says if it had n't been for the emergency oil release , gasoline prices would have jumped even higher than they already are . `` You 've basically alleviated any chance of ridiculous oil prices for the summer , '' says Salazar . But there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the U.S. reaches its planned 180 million barrel limit . A lot will depend on the conditions in crude markets at the time . Can other oil producers step up production ? The oil cartel OPEC and its allies , a group known as OPEC+ , is in the best position to make up for lost supply , but that 's unlikely . For one , Russia is a member of OPEC+ . Any moves against Russia risks jeopardizing the alliance that has long been important to stabilizing the global price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some members of OPEC+ are struggling to meet their current quotas due to political strife and underinvestment . OPEC+ countries have been gradually increasing production by about 430,000 barrels per day since last summer , in a steady effort to get back to pre pandemic levels of production . OPEC+ meets again on Thursday and is largely expected to maintain its current plans to increase production only gradually . What about U.S. producers ? The U.S. is the world 's biggest producer of oil , but most of that oil is consumed domestically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said than done . It takes months for even the fastest producers to build a new well . And labor challenges and supply chain problems are lengthening that timeline . Oil companies are still proceeding cautiously . These companies are beholden to their investors , and those investors do n't want to invest in further drilling . They lost a ton of money in the oil crash at the beginning of the pandemic , and growing concerns about environmental impact are making them hesitant to invest further . That said , U.S. producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that U.S. producers will increase output by an average of 800,000 barrels a day this year . But it 's hard to go faster than that , and that simply does n't make up for the expected loss of Russian oil . """""""

Per Statista , here are the countries most dependent on Russia for natural gas . The percentages tell us just how dependent : As of 2019 , a full 27 percent of the European Union ’ s crude oil , 41 percent of its natural gas , and 47 percent of its solid fuel ( mostly coal ) come from Russia . Well , it ’ s very simple . Russia is not stupid . Putin is not stupid . He drills and digs and fracks while Western countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal mines , refusing oil leases , and shuttering nuclear power plants . And in doing so , even at the expense of giving the gangster Putin leverage over them , these Western countries pat themselves on the back for decreasing their carbon footprints and going green… Meanwhile , Putin is given control over the very thing that allows Western Civilization to remain Western Civilization : energy . Without energy , we are back in the dark ages within a few months . Ah , but our Western Wackos , our John Kerrys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela Merkels don ’ t want to get their hands dirty producing energy . Instead , they choose to take advice from a weird little girl who doesn ’ t go to school and import the energy from a gangster who is open about his expansionist ambition and who is not afraid to dirty his hands dirty digging and drilling and fracking . Sure , the E.U . and America claim they are “ producing energy ” by going green — solar and what not . And sure , the corrupt Western media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending the unicorn of green energy is real . But guess who ’ s not fooled by the unicorn of green energy ? That would be Putin , who laughs as the E.U . hands him the energy switch that can turn the E.U . into a third-world country in a matter of months . So the gangster Putin invades Ukraine and says , What are you going to do about it ? Are you gon na attack me when I can shut off your economy ? Sanctions ! Sanctions ! ? Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ’ re going to sanction me while I make trillions selling you all your energy ? Everything that has happened since Joe Biden allegedly won the 2020 election has told Putin to go right ahead and invade Ukraine . • On day one , Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline . • Biden greenlit Nord Stream 2 , a Russian pipeline that will provide 55 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Europe every year . • Germany announces the closing of three of its six nuclear power plants just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilled Putin was when Germany shut down half of its working nuclear reactors ? It ’ s okay , sweetheart ; I can send you all the energy you need , said the Devil .

So instead of NATO countries , like America , using our vast natural resources and nuclear science to keep each other going , to keep NATO energy independent , we pretend we ’ re virtuous by shutting down our own pipelines ( while approving Putin ’ s ) and killing our own energy production while we import the same amount of energy from a gangster . And this reliance not only gives this gangster leverage over us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars that keep him in power and fund his expansionism .

""""""" A year and a half after the attack on the U.S. Capitol , Congress has passed precisely zero legislation to prevent it from happening again . But it could be close . Now a group of Democrats and Republicans is recommending new limits to Congress ’ s and the vice president ’ s roles in declaring the presidential winner . They want to change a very old law known as the Electoral Count Act that they think President Donald Trump exploited to try to stay in power in 2020 . The House of Representatives passed its bill recently , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And efforts to reform this law just got a big boost from the top Senate Republican , Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) , who endorsed the Senate ’ s version of the bill . Here ’ s what ’ s going on . Congress ’ s job is to simply count up each state ’ s electoral votes — with the vice president presiding over it all in a ceremonial capacity — and officially declare the winner of the presidential election . After that , all that ’ s left is to inaugurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act is a 140-year-old law that governs what Congress and the vice president should do in the case of a dispute about which presidential candidate won in a state . ( A legitimate dispute about who won the presidential election actually happened in 1876 . ) It ’ s taken this long to find a compromise , particularly in the Senate , that has enough Republican support to pass . Making these changes means going directly against Trump ’ s will ; he ’ s publicly bashed Republicans leading this effort . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation has underscored the urgency of preventing rogue actors from abusing the Electoral Count Act . If Trump ’ s plan had worked , retired federal judge J. Michael Luttig told the Jan. 6 congressional committee , it “ would have been the first constitutional crisis since the founding of the Republic. ” The authors of a House bill to reform the law , Reps. Liz Cheney ( R-Wyo . ) and Zoe Lofgren ( D-Calif. ) , warned in the Wall Street Journal this month that the GOP ’ s continued embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another effort to steal a presidential election , perhaps with another attempt to corrupt Congress ’ s proceeding to tally electoral votes. ” On Tuesday , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) endorsed making changes to this bill , saying : “ Congress ’ s process for counting their presidential electors votes was written 135 ago . The chaos that came to a head on Jan. 6 of last year certainly underscored the need for an update. ” They ’ re trying to figure that out . The House and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ ll have to come to agreement to get anything passed and to Biden ’ s desk . Plus , they ’ re running out of time before Republicans potentially take control of one or both chambers of Congress , and there is not a majority of support within the GOP for these changes . One option that has the support of all lawmakers working on this : making it crystal clear that the vice president can ’ t override the will of voters — that their job is largely ministerial . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2024 , Vice President Harris will be presiding over certifying the victory . ) Lawmakers also want to raise the bar for how many members of Congress are required to challenge election results . Right now it ’ s two , one from each chamber . The House bill would raise this threshold significantly , to one-third of lawmakers in each chamber . The Senate bill puts the threshold slightly lower , at one-fifth , report The Washington Post ’ s Marianna Sotomayor and Leigh Ann Caldwell . ( After the Jan. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to question the results . But 139 House Republicans still voted not to certify certain states ’ election results . Eight senators joined them . ) Both bills also try to clarify part of the law — basically , an unclear rule about the timing of a state ’ s election — that could allow bad actors to argue a state ’ s electors aren ’ t legitimate . Lawmakers also want to , in some ways , make it easier for a presidential candidate to challenge election results — but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a special court for them to adjudicate their claims , with a pipeline directly to the Supreme Court . The hope is that this would settle any disputes quickly . There are still major details the House and Senate need to work out , and the debate could take the rest of the year to finish . But Congress is closer than ever to doing something to prevent another election dispute like 2020 ’ s — and its ensuing political violence . """""""

"In recent months, Donald Trump’s campaign and conservative action groups have developed a coordinated strategy to gut the federal civil service, effectively returning the United States government to the spoils system of the nineteenth century. Under this plan, Trump, if returned to office, would issue an executive order called “Schedule F,” which would reclassify the status of thousands of employees—making it easier for the president to fire them at will. The Heritage Foundation has crafted “Project 2025” to create a “civic infrastructure” to implement on day one of a second Trump term, including tens of thousands of right-wing Trump ideologues ready to replace fired civil servants. Heritage recently recruited potential candidates at the Iowa State Fair and other locations nationwide. This plan would reproduce the spoils system’s worst corruption, grift, and inefficiencies. The spoils system is the colloquial term for the period from roughly 1828 to 1883 when political appointees were doled out government positions in return for their vote and political loyalty. To the victory of the presidential election went the extensive and lucrative “spoils.” Under the spoils system, most federal positions were political appointees, from post office managers to customs house collectors to clerks in the executive departments. Party bosses granted these positions as rewards to loyal operatives and used them as cudgels to force supporters to toe the party line."

And sometimes we’re so quick to go to the ‘but’ part that we negate that opportunity to grieve, which might be a place for coming together in grief. If we felt we could just have a moment of grief, we might not have to be so polarized about it.” For some in the congregation, the attacks have meant wrestling with internal conflict. Sarah Sokolic, Lab/Shul’s executive director, said she grew up being taught that Israel was good and Palestinians were bad, and has worked for the last two decades to promote more nuanced, progressive views. Now, she said: “I find myself asking, How can I be a Zionist and be a person who does anti-oppression work at the same time? How can I teach my children about power, oppression, equity, empathy, otherness while also teaching them that Israel is our homeland, and that Israel has a right to exist and defend herself?” As she wrestles, she said, “I find myself leaning into my Zionist roots.”"
"The US House of Representatives returns this week from yet another long and unearned recess with only 12 working days until the deadline for funding the government for the fiscal year which starts October 1.

But House Republicans are holding the government hostage, refusing to budge unless the ultra-conservative wing’s ever-changing demands are met. Topping their list is the impeachment of President Joe Biden. Not that they have any hard evidence to support such a move, but the invertebrate Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, is expected to give them the go-ahead because he knows if he doesn’t, they might take away his gavel."

It also included FAA reauthorization, federal disaster relief and an extension of federal flood insurance. The Senate approved it in an 88-9 vote hours later."

""""""" Tiger Woods produced a couple of firsts Saturday , neither cause for a fist pump . He posted his highest score ever in the PGA Championship , and later withdrew from a major for the first time in his pro career . Hours after Woods limped his way to a 9-over 79 in the third round at Southern Hills , he informed the PGA of America of his withdrawal . Anyone who watched the staggered steps from a right leg that was battered 15 months ago in a car crash should not have been surprised . Woods declined media interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pool reporter . He was asked if days like this — high pain , high score — made him question the process it takes to play and if he would tee it up on Sunday . `` Well , I 'm sore . I know that is for a fact , '' he said . `` We 'll do some work and see how it goes . '' The PGA of America announced his withdrawal after the third round ended . Woods was 21 shots behind Mito Pereira of Chile , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . For Woods , attention now turns to next month at the U.S. Open . When he made the cut at the Masters in his first time walking and competing against the best since the February 2021 car crash in Los Angeles , he said he would be at the British Open at St. Andrews in July . He did not mention the PGA Championship or U.S. Open , wanting to assess his recovery . But he made a trip to Southern Hills in the weeks ahead of the PGA and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Masters . That lasted only so long . Even as he grimaced at times , Woods produced his most compelling golf on Friday afternoon with he rallied to make the cut with a series of clutch putts and short-game wizardry . Woods has played through pain during his career , more memorably the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines that he won with a double stress fracture in his left leg and shredded ligaments in his left knee that required season-ending surgery when it was over . But on Saturday , walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-inch of rain in the early morning , he had reason to wonder if making the cut was worth it . `` I did n't do anything right , '' Woods said after making a 5-foot par putt on the 18th to break 80 . `` I did n't hit many good shots . Consequently , I ended up with a pretty high score . '' It was n't his worst in a major . There was that 81 in the 2002 British Open in the raging wind and bitter cold of Muirfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slam . He had an 80 at Chambers Bay in the 2015 U.S. Open while recovering from the first of what would be five back surgeries . This was painful to watch , and not just the sloppy play with wedges and two water balls . Much like the weekend at the Masters , his first competition since the February 2021 car crash that mangled his right leg , the limp became more pronounced as the day went on . And the weather — the high 50s , compared with a heat index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week — did n't help . `` You feel so sorry for him having to go through this , '' said Shaun Norris , the South African who played with Woods before a large gallery , but certainly not the size of the previous two days . `` But then again , you also see the type of person that he is , that he grinds through everything and pushes himself , even all the pain and that , '' Norris said . `` It 's not easy to see a guy like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle like that . He 's swinging it nicely , and I think he 'll be back once he gets back to normal health and sorts out all the problems . '' Woods chose not to speak to the media , instead offering a few thoughts to a pool reporter . He did n't get into one of the clear problems , which was distance control . Whether the ball was n't flying as far because of the cold or his speed was slower than he realized , there were two occasions when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball landed . One was on the par-3 sixth hole , when Woods ' shot not only came up short , it found the water . He put his next shot short into the shaggy collar , flubbed a chip and walked off with a triple bogey . And that was only the start . Woods made five straight bogeys from the ninth hole . One of them was on the par-3 11th , when he posed over an 8-iron only to see it land short — well short . He looked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's short of the bunker ! '' His pitch up the hill had so much pace that it ran over the green and down the slope , and he had to make a 4-footer to escape with bogey . This was one hole after a similar pitch up the hill from slightly farther away settled on the top shelf of a green . The pin was at the front . And then on the par-5 13th , when a bold play to go over the green from the first cut of rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pay off , his pitch from 100 feet went 35 feet past the pin and off the green . A likely birdie turned into a bogey . `` Could n't get off the bogey train , '' he said . Even when it looked like a lost cause , and there were moments where it looked as though his right knee began to buckle , Woods rarely rushed a shot or a putt . The lone bright spot was a 35-foot birdie putt on the 15th , and Woods forced a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air to mark his first birdie of the day . It also was his only one . He talked Friday about needing a hot round , and that was n't available to him on a cold day . He ultimately decided it was n't worth going through again . """""""

""""""" When Pennsylvania Lt. Gov . John Fetterman took up the cause of Dennis and Lee Horton , long-incarcerated brothers serving life sentences for second-degree murder , he vowed to strenuously advocate for their release , even if it ended his political career . “ Even if he lost the next election and every election after that , ” Lee Horton , 56 , recalled the Democrat telling his sister . “ He was going to fight until he got us home , ” Horton told NBC News in a telephone interview . The Horton brothers , who maintain their innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left prison last year , their sentences commuted by Democratic Gov . Tom Wolf after a recommendation by the state Board of Pardons that Fetterman chairs . And true to Fetterman ’ s foreshadowing , Republicans are now emphasizing the case as he runs for Senate in one of the year ’ s most hostile races . Fetterman ’ s GOP opponent in November , celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz , casts him as soft on crime , pointing to how he has championed clemency for the Hortons and others convicted of similar felonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fetterman took office in 2019 , consistent with his progressive philosophy on criminal justice reform . But the campaign attacks have omitted both context — such as recommendations of leniency from judges , prosecutors and prison officials — and the nuances of a state law that requires life sentences for second-degree murder . For example , the getaway driver in a fatal shooting can be punished just as severely as the person who pulled the trigger . Oz and the outside groups supporting him have spent millions of dollars to hammer home the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have outspent Democrats $ 24.5 million to $ 21.9 million on advertising in the Senate race , according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact . Many of the ads from the Oz campaign , the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the GOP-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC have focused on crime . “ We all know Fetterman loves free stuff , ” a narrator says at the end of one recent 30-second digital ad from Oz ’ s campaign . “ But we can ’ t let him free murderers. ” The attacks also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an “ Inmates for Fetterman ” website , paid for by Oz ’ s campaign , featuring mugshots of those whose commutations Fetterman has supported , including the Hortons . Oz has even called on Fetterman to fire the two brothers , who now work for his campaign as field organizers . The Hortons were involved in mentoring and anti-violence programs while in prison , where their clemency case received support not only from Fetterman but also prison administrators familiar with their character . Several questions remain unanswered about the investigation that led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers have said they were pulled over by police in Philadelphia after offering a ride to a friend , not knowing he was fleeing the scene of a crime . Witnesses had identified them as assailants , The Philadelphia Inquirer reported , but police files turned over decades later identified another man as the shooter . “ John believes there are people who deserve to spend the rest of their life behind bars in prison , but he also supports common sense bipartisan policies to free the wrongly convicted and provide second chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Calvello , a spokesperson for Fetterman , said . “ John ’ s work on the Board of Pardons was widely praised , including by elected Republican officials . All Dr. Oz and his team are engaging in is gross fear mongering. ” Oz ’ s focus on crime and clemency has also angered advocates for criminal justice reform . “ What I don ’ t love — what frustrates me about what I ’ m seeing — is funny memes about felons for this person or that person , ” said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party official who leads the Justice Action Network , a national bipartisan organization . “ I don ’ t like seeing cruelty . Cartoonish memes really devalue the hard work of so many people that we know. ” The race between Fetterman and Oz to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is one of the most competitive in the nation this fall and could determine control of the evenly split Senate . Recent polls have shown Fetterman ’ s once-wide lead is now shrinking . Several Republican strategists who spoke to NBC News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s focus on crime — and not his campaign ’ s relentless attacks on Fetterman ’ s reluctance to debate as he recovers from a stroke . When asked this week about Fetterman ’ s health , Sen. Rick Scott , who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee , said the Democrat has to “ come clean ” on both his condition and what Scott called “ his radical policies ” on crime . Oz spokesperson Barney Keller said the nuance surrounding the clemency cases does not undercut the campaign ’ s core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with voters on crime , an argument many Republican candidates are making against Democratic opponents heading into November . “ Dr . Oz is surging in the polls because the more people learn that John Fetterman is the most pro-murderer candidate in the entire country , the more people recognize that Dr. Oz will better represent Pennsylvania and its values than John Fetterman ever will , ” Keller said . The Oz campaign 's messaging has put Fetterman on the defensive . He has responded with his own ads . “ Doc Oz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on crime , ” Fetterman says in one TV spot that details his earlier work as mayor of Braddock , a town near Pittsburgh . “ Public safety is why I ran for office. ” Fetterman has also said that the opportunity to oversee the Board of Pardons is one reason why he ran for lieutenant governor . Under state law , the lieutenant governor chairs the pardons board . Clemency had largely fallen out of favor in Pennsylvania , especially in murder cases after a convicted murderer released from a life sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and commit other violent crimes in New York . State law was later changed to require unanimous Board of Pardons approval to recommend commutations for those serving life sentences . Criminal justice experts have long cited Pennsylvania ’ s mandatory life sentence for second-degree murder as excessive . Shawn Bushway , a senior policy researcher for the nonprofit Rand Corp. , said that the punishment is often disproportionate , does little to deter crime and keeps behind bars people who are unlikely to reoffend if released . “ It ’ s not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ’ s a society ’ s decision , ” said Bushway , who is also a professor of public administration and policy at the State University of New York at Albany . “ It does seem reasonable that you should consider the costs and benefits on both sides . And I don ’ t think there are a lot of benefits here for those kinds of extra-long sentences. ” Between 1995 and 2014 , a mix of Democratic and Republican governors commuted only six life sentences in Pennsylvania , according to state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2015 , commuted five in his first term as governor , but clemency has risen sharply since Fetterman became lieutenant governor in 2019 . In his second term , Wolf has already commuted 47 life sentences , at the urging of the pardons board . “ John took a fair-minded approach to clemency cases , voting to give second chances to the wrongfully convicted and deserving elder inmates , but also voting to deny hundreds of applications where he felt clemency wasn ’ t merited , ” said Calvello , the Fetterman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John scrupulously reviewed clemency applications and consulted with corrections officials , prison wardens , judges and DAs . One question John would always ask was , ‘ Would you want this person as your neighbor ? ’ ” In search of political liabilities , Oz and his Republican allies have mined Fetterman ’ s comments about clemency and the cases he has championed . Independent fact-checkers have rapped them for broad brush attacks . Fetterman has not , as one Oz ad implies , called for eliminating all life sentences for murderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors ending the mandatory life sentence for second-degree murder . Oz has also hammered Fetterman for agreeing with a state corrections official ’ s assessment that one-third of Pennsylvania ’ s prison population could be released without posing a threat to public safety . The attacks parse words and imply that Fetterman has directly fought for such a measure , but he has not , Calvello said . Oz ’ s emphasis on the Horton brothers and five others highlighted on the Inmates for Fetterman website leaves out certain details as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been serving life sentences on second-degree murder convictions , with a variety of mitigating circumstances in their favor . All had served at least a quarter-century behind bars . In one case , the district attorney asked in a sentencing exhibit that “ serious consideration ” be given to any clemency request . In another case , the prosecuting attorney — by that point a judge — spoke at the clemency hearing on the inmate ’ s behalf . And under state law , none would have been released had the pardons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement . One of the men whose mugshot appears on the site — the only one convicted of first-degree murder — remains incarcerated after Fetterman was the only person on the five-member pardons board to cast a vote in favor of clemency .

Unlike others who had their sentences commuted after admitting to the crime and expressing remorse , the Hortons have maintained their innocence .

The board returned a year later with a unanimous decision in favor of commutation .

"THE RULE OF LAW means, at its core, that those who govern may not simply issue decrees. Their actions must be based on reasons that are publicly known. Power must explain itself. So, it should be big news when courts break their own rules. As one Supreme Court opinion explained in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), “the Court’s legitimacy depends on making legally principled decisions under circumstances in which their principled character is sufficiently plausible to be accepted by the Nation.”But the laws that bind courts are rules of procedure, which are notoriously technical and complex. If courts abuse their power, how are ordinary citizens to know that this is happening?Stephen Vladeck’s new book, The Shadow Docket: How the Supreme Court Uses Stealth Rulings to Amass Power and Undermine the Republic, is important because it explains those rules clearly, and shows that the court—particularly since Amy Coney Barrett joined it and cemented its right-wing majority—has been defying them, often in partisan ways that benefit Republicans. A large part of the court’s business consists of unexplained orders—what has been called the “shadow docket” of decisions. For a long time, the power to issue such orders was unexceptionable and necessary. And until recently, the court deployed that power with care and restraint.A provision in the judicial code, first enacted in 1789, authorizes the Supreme Court to issue emergency injunctions in cases where the lower courts, which inevitably are more familiar with the facts of the cases before them, have refused to do so. Such orders are often issued without explanation. Cognizant of the danger of uninformed meddling, Justice Potter Stewart declared in 1968 that this power should be utilized “sparingly and only in the most critical and exigent circumstances.” Justice William Rehnquist observed in 1972 that the right to emergency relief has to be “indisputably clear.” In 1986, Justice Antonin Scalia cited both of these passages with approval. Likewise, in 2001, the full court held that such an order “is appropriate only if the legal rights at issue are indisputably clear.”Yet lately, this power has been deployed frequently, aggressively, and in ways that make the judges look like Republican Party apparatchiks.Sometimes the court issued shadow docket orders to reverse lower-court injunctions that had, correctly as it later turned out, blocked illegal government action, including the military ban on transgender members, a rule punishing immigrants who needed publicly funded medical care, new limits on asylum for refugees, and a ban on abortions for minors in immigration detention. “Over and over throughout the Trump administration, policies that no court ever upheld (and that multiple lower-court judges had held to be unlawful) were allowed to remain in effect for years thanks to one-sentence orders from the Court,” writes Vladeck. Some of the actions that the court put back into place, Vladeck reports, “would eventually be deemed unlawful by every court that actually ruled on their merits.” This pattern of deference to presidential prerogatives abruptly stopped after Joseph Biden’s inauguration.Even though a challenge was filed the day Alabama issued its 2022 electoral map in response to the latest census, and the challengers persuaded the district court that the map was drawn with racist intent, the court declared that it was already too close to the election for a district court to stop it. That meant, Vladeck observes, that “every state would get one free election cycle using unlawful district maps every ten years.” But the court also, at the behest of the Republican National Committee, blocked a Wisconsin map that would have created a new majority-Black district, and intervened to block mail-in ballots in that state the day before an election. In sum, “the election cases appeared to be almost homogeneously partisan, with conservative justices voting in favor of whatever position supported the political power of Republicans.”Death penalty cases likewise skewed in suspicious ways. In a pair of 2019 decisions, a state was first permitted to allow Christian but not Muslim chaplains in the execution chamber, and then eight weeks later the court ruled for a Buddhist in a similar case, weirdly mirroring the anti-Muslim animus of the Trumpified Republican Party. The court rushed the execution of Dustin Higgs, who died January 16, 2021, even though his arguments were scheduled to be heard in the Court of Appeals on January 22. What was the emergency that justified vacating his stay of execution? The court didn’t say. But it is hard not to notice that Biden, who opposes the death penalty and might have commuted the sentence, was about to be sworn in. That is, the danger was that an elected official would exercise his undisputed authority in a way the judges didn’t like. So, writes Vladeck, the court “invented a brand-new shadow docket procedure to allow the Trump administration to execute one last prisoner on its way out the door, all while ignoring the limits that its own rules supposedly imposed on such relief.”The list goes on. As Vladeck writes, “It’s difficult to dismiss as coincidence that the Court’s interventions in immigration cases, for example, generally allowed President Donald Trump’s policies to go into effect and generally blocked President Joe Biden’s policies.” Yet when Texas devised a novel scheme that made it impossible to exercise the right to abortion, which at that time was still constitutionally protected, the court “hid behind procedural questions.”During the COVID-19 crisis, crowded churches sometimes became vectors for spreading disease. Many states imposed restrictions on religious gatherings. As soon as Barrett joined the court, it started blocking those restrictions—once more, in cases where courts had not yet taken evidence. It invoked new, previously unheard-of rules. (See my article “The Increasingly Dangerous Variants of the ‘Most-Favored-Nation’ Theory of Religious Liberty” in the Iowa Law Review.) Rights can’t be “indisputably clear” when the court just made them up and the facts are disputed. Chief Justice John Roberts’s dissents from decisions that he likely found politically congenial show that the objection to the court’s misbehavior is based on more than political disagreement.Vladeck concludes that the court’s new use of its injunction power is “indefensibly lawless.” In these cases, there has been no trial and no opportunity to develop an evidentiary record. The court reproaches lower courts for failing to heed its earlier orders—orders issued without any opinions explaining them, which makes them hard to heed. Justice Elena Kagan observed that henceforth “officials must guess which restrictions this Court will choose to strike down.” Vladeck writes that the Court was “[o]blivious to the irony of complaining about a lower court’s failure to apply an analytical framework that the Court itself had never articulated.”The purportedly religious resistance to efforts to contain the coronavirus (resistance which itself followed curiously partisan patterns) finally became too much for the court when it was presented with vaccine-refusing healthcare workers. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch wanted to let those workers go back to their jobs in hospitals and nursing homes. Justices Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh disagreed, noting that the emergency power involved “a discretionary judgment about whether the Court should grant review in the case,” which would force the court to make a preliminary judgment on the merits “on a short fuse without benefit of full briefing and oral argument.” That was of course true of all the earlier orders they had both supported.Vladeck thinks that their hesitation might have been “a tacit concession that they had exercised that discretion a bit too permissively over the previous eleven months.” But there is a more disturbing possibility: what restrained them was precisely their view of the merits. Vaccine refusal was by far the most extreme religious liberty claim the court heard, threatening to expose already frail and sick patients to COVID-19. Gorsuch made the astounding claim that preventing contagious, deadly diseases is not a sufficiently compelling interest to justify burdens on religious dissenters. He also proposed that, because some people have been excused from vaccination for medical reasons—a tiny number have life-threatening allergic reactions—“the most narrowly tailored means” to achieve herd immunity “is to re­strict vaccine exemptions to a particular number divided in a nondiscriminatory manner between medical and religious objectors.” Faced with people whom no ethical doctor would vaccinate, Gorsuch thinks that the fair solution is to force vaccines on them in order to make room for the religious. That wouldn’t even contain disease: religious vaccine resistors tend to be geographically clustered, to spread the disease among themselves, and so to present far greater risks than those with medical excuses. (I explain all this in detail in my ILR article, cited above.)It would be nice if we knew that Barrett and Kavanaugh reject Gorsuch’s position. But if that’s what stopped them from joining him, then Vladeck is too optimistic in suggesting that the court was (is?) beginning to respect the legal limits on its power. They just happened to decide, in this case, to exercise their unconstrained power in a different way. Vladeck notes: “As for what would govern that discretion going forward, the Court’s two newest justices wouldn’t say.”Why does the court have such broad powers at all? Vladeck begins the book by explaining how, over many decades, Congress gave the Supreme Court increasing control over its docket. Today it has full autonomy.Vladeck could say more than he does about why this discretionary control over its agenda makes sense. Justice Joseph Story explained in 1816 the core function of the Supreme Court: Judges of equal learning and integrity in different States might differently interpret a statute or a treaty of the United States, or even the Constitution itself; if there were no revising authority to control these jarring and discordant judgments and harmonize them into uniformity, the laws, the treaties, and the Constitution of the United States would be different in different States, and might perhaps never have precisely the same construction, obligation, or efficacy in any two States. The public mischiefs that would attend such a State of things would be truly deplorable. For a long time, the rules laid down by Congress described in detail which cases the court must and may not hear. By the 20th century, the court faced a flood of appeals and developed tools for managing its docket. It demanded jurisdictional statements in support of petitions for appellate review, aimed at persuading the court that the appeal presented a substantial federal question. Only then would the court invite fuller briefing and argument. If petitions did not meet the “substantial” question threshold, the court would affirm or reverse them summarily—rulings that had weight as precedent in the lower federal courts, even though they had not been briefed or argued. That created ill-reasoned law, as when it declared in Baker v. Nelson (1971) that same-sex marriage did not create a substantial federal question.Today, Congress has given it much broader discretion. The court’s announced standards for agreeing to hear a case (you can look up Supreme Court Rule 10) generally line up with Story’s concerns: typically, to resolve “conflicts” on “important” questions about the meaning of federal law, including the Constitution, where importance is, as Vladeck observes, “left to the subjective determination of the justices.” This supervisory power wouldn’t mean much if the court couldn’t slap down flagrant error or outright defiance from the lower courts, which has sometimes happened. Thus the emergency injunction power.The virtue of this arrangement is that, with respect to issues it declines to hear, the court makes no law at all. But Vladeck shows that the new shadow docket practice is in fact making new law, “through rulings that are unsigned and unexplained (or, at least, insufficiently explained).” “[T]hose rulings are objectively inconsistent in how they apply the same procedural standards,” he argues, “in ways that certainly appear to favor Republican policies (or litigants) over Democratic ones; and […] the justices themselves are now insisting that at least some of these inconsistent and insufficiently explained rulings have precedential effects.” All this amounts to “a full-blown institutional crisis.”At the end of the book, Vladeck responds to efforts by Alito and Barrett to defend the court’s work. Some of Alito’s claims, such as that the shadow docket orders do not have the authority of precedent, are flatly untrue. Barrett told an audience in 2022 that you can see that the court is not results-oriented if you just “read the opinion.” Vladeck responds: “[I]t’s essential context to point out that, just two days later, she joined a 5–4 shadow docket ruling with no opinion for the public to read.”We have a rogue Supreme Court. It disregards normal constraints on its power because it can. After the unseemly gamesmanship that led to the appointments of Gorsuch and Barrett, the new conservative majority should have looked for opportunities to, as Barrett said shortly after her confirmation, “convince you that this court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks.” Instead, it has become perhaps the most politically extreme and partisan Supreme Court in American history.The shadow docket is only part of that story. The dramatic decision to overrule abortion rights is only the tip of a very large iceberg of right-wing triumphalism. The court has been so sympathetic to a libertarian philosophy that appears nowhere in the Constitution that it has devised vague new rules that constrain the federal government’s capacity to address climate change or prevent the spread of COVID-19. It has devised inventive new ways to prevent Congress from guaranteeing voting rights. It deployed a distorted and dishonest pseudo-originalism to block gun control. It has given conservative Christians a broad license to defy laws they don’t like.Vladeck is reticent about how to remedy this situation. Congress could rein in the court by imposing term limits, adding additional justices, or stripping the court of jurisdiction over some cases. All these measures are drastic and not normally to be considered, but our situation is extreme. None of that will happen without a political consensus that the judges have really become, in Barrett’s phrase, a bunch of partisan hacks. She and the other Republican appointees have inadvertently been working to build that consensus. The best way for them to keep the public from thinking that is to stop making it true. Vladeck is right that his narrative shows “the importance of involving and investing the public in understanding the technicalities of legal process itself.”Lawyers sometimes irritate other people with their persnicketiness about technicalities (as I’ve previously noted for The Hill ). But scrupulousness about legal detail is what gives courts their authority. This Supreme Court feels free to issue orders to public officials based on gut feelings, undisturbed by exposure to evidence. Its lack of authority means that it is not merely misinterpreting the law. It is breaking it."

""""""" For most people , the World Cup is the only sporting event they ’ d wait for 4 long years . So , the whole world seems to stop when it ’ s finally time to turn on the TV and enjoy a few matches . Since 1930 , the World Cup has been a celebration that has given us unusual and incredible anecdotes . Here are some that we can not forget . 1 . The youngest player to score a goal in the World Cup It was 1958 , and the World Cup was held in Sweden when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team appeared and changed the history of soccer forever : Pelé .

In the inaugural World Cup of 1930 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rego lost track of time and blew the whistle to mark the end of the Argentina-France match 6 minutes before it was scheduled to end . The Argentines were leading 1-0 , and the French planned a comeback when the referee blew the final whistle . The Argentinian team rejoiced while the French protested . The referee then rectified the mistake and ordered the remaining six minutes to be played . The police on horseback had to be called in to force the fans off the pitch and bring the Argentine team back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the score didn ’ t change . 3 . The first World Cup broadcasted in color The 1970 World Cup in Mexico was one of the most memorable events in the sport ’ s history because it was the first to have color broadcasting . It was also the first World Cup broadcast worldwide , the first to be played outside Europe and South America , and the first to feature now-classic elements such as penalty cards and substitutions . 4 . The game with the most goals in history The quarterfinals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match between Switzerland and Austria . And while it may seem like the most normal match ever , it soon became apparent that this was not the case . In total , 12 goals were scored : 7 by Austria and 5 by the hosts .

The fastest goal of the World Cup At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa , a situation never seen before in the history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers faced each other in the same match with different teams . The match was Ghana vs. Germany in the group stage . Jérôme Boateng played for the German team , while Kevin-Prince Boateng played for Ghana . When speaking of top scorers , people probably think of well-known characters like Maradona , Pelé , Ronaldo , or even Messi . But the honor of top scorer goes to Frenchman Just Fontaine , who still holds the record today , with 13 goals in 6 games in Sweden ’ s 1958 World Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mexican wave was born in a baseball stadium .

The Pope arrived in Quebec Wednesday afternoon , traveling first to the Archbishopric before transferring to the Citadelle de Quebec , the official home of Governor General Mary Simon , where a welcoming ceremony took place . After brief introductions , Pope Francis , along with civil dignitaries , was greeted into the reception hall as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

As part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder from the Huron-Wendat nation opened proceedings by initiating what is known as a ritual “ smudge to the four directions , ” using sweetgrass and animal feathers to waft smoke around the room . As noted by LifeSiteNews , the ritual , which apes the use of Catholic sacraments and sacramentals , “ is a clear act of pagan superstition , ” reminiscent of the Holy Father ’ s veneration of the pagan pachamama idol at the Vatican in 2019 . The ritual is intended as “ a ritual of purification ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed to as a kind of pantheistic deity .

"WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Thursday, Sept. 7, the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed a set of lawsuits that challenged the state’s congressional map for partisan gerrymandering. This decision preserves the status quo, leaving in place a congressional map that the Ohio Supreme Court previously struck down for being a partisan gerrymander. Ohioans voted under this map during the 2022 elections and will again vote under it in 2024. Nevertheless, the pro-voting groups behind the lawsuits — who requested that the court dismiss their cases — maintain that “this is the best result under the circumstances for the people of Ohio who deserve certainty about the congressional map that they will be voting under in this cycle, at the very least.” In other words, Ohio Republicans will not have the opportunity to further gerrymander the state’s congressional map before 2024."

Today , with 70 percent of the vote counted , Lake trails in the polls by less than a percentage point , but she points to printer errors in Maricopa County that delayed the tabulating of votes as evidence of a potentially nefarious plot to stymie her win . “ We had a big day today , ” Lake told a room full of her supporters late Tuesday night . “ And don ’ t let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Don ’ t let them doubt . Don ’ t let them put doubt in you. ” Such claims by Lake , and other Arizona Republican candidates , harken back to the so-called Stop the Steal movement , a disinformation campaign aimed at overturning the 2020 presidential election and which had a strong foothold in Arizona . Like then , Lake has lashed out at election officials over the conduct of this week ’ s elections . “ The fake media back there tried to tell us we were wrong for asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said on election night . “ We needed another stark reminder that we have incompetent people running the show in Arizona. ” “ When we win , the first line of action is to return honestly to Arizona elections . Are you willing for incompetency to play its self out and for the victory to come at us ? ” Lake asked to her supporters ’ cheers . “ When we win , and I think it will be within hours , we will declare victory , and we will get to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no more corruption in Arizona elections. ” Chants of “ Kari ! ” broke out in the crowd . Lake continued railing against Maricopa County on Thursday . Speaking to Charlie Kirk on “ The Charlie Kirk Show , ” Lake pointed the finger at election officials in the county and Democrats . “ I think there could be some intentional actions here to slow roll this . They always intentionally have the early ballots ready to go , they favor the Democrats , they want to bring down the excitement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted to throw cold water on our movement , they want to take that victory , they want to make it look like America First isn ’ t thriving , when in fact it is. ” “ I believe it was a traffic jam by design .

During his discussion with Lake , Kirk pointed the finger at the election officials in Maricopa County , saying that poll workers were being manipulated . “ These poor people are being manipulated by Bill Gates and Steven Richer , ” Kirk said .

""""""" The Chicago Police Board has denied the Civilian Office of Police Accountability ’ s recommendation to fire the officer who shot Anthony Alvarez in a high-profile case last year , with a reviewer for the board calling the shooting “ objectively reasonable. ” Alvarez , 22 , was fatally shot by Chicago police Officer Evan Solano after a foot chase in Portage Park . Police Board member Steven Block reviewed COPA ’ s investigation and recommendation of separation and denied it . At Thursday night ’ s Police Board meeting , Block announced his decision to side with Chicago police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 20-day suspension for Solano . Block , a partner at the law firm Thompson Hine and a Police Board member since late 2021 , wrote in his opinion of the case that Solano ’ s use of force was “ objectively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances as the officers reasonably perceived them. ” He agreed with Brown that COPA ’ s evidence was “ legally insufficient ” to sustain that the officers acted against general orders when using force and engaging in the foot pursuit . Block found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension was more reasonable than the chief administrator ’ s recommendation of firing the officer . Block only agreed with the allegations that Solano failed to activate his body-worn camera in a timely manner , properly load his firearm or make a required notification to the Office of Emergency Management and Communications of the pursuit . Block ’ s opinion noted that the officers had reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop of Alvarez based on their knowledge that he had been driving on March 29 , 2021 , with a suspended license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest Alvarez based on how he held his waistband when he fled , leading the officers to believe he was illegally concealing a firearm . Block also noted that the officers were familiar with Alvarez because both Solano and his partner , Sammy Encarnacion , had responded to a domestic call involving Alvarez and the mother of his child the previous April . That call resulted in Solano chasing Alvarez , who was detained without incident . Block disagreed with COPA ’ s finding that Solano failed to use de-escalation techniques . Solano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ continual communication , ” yelling at him to drop the gun — and further warning that Solano was going to shoot could have prompted Alvarez to shoot first , Block found . But because Encarnacion did not activate his body-worn camera until after Alvarez had been shot , footage of the foot pursuit captured by the camera was in buffering mode , which does not have audio . So Block credited the officers ’ consistent testimonies to confirm the verbal demands directed at Alvarez during the pursuit . The attorney for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice in a statement Thursday . “ The Alvarez family continues to reel from Anthony ’ s death . They are appalled by Mr. Block ’ s decision to merely recommend a 20-day suspension of a police officer who COPA determined violated numerous policies and directives before killing Anthony Alvarez , ” the statement read. `` ... Today ’ s decision is not only a gut-punch to the Alvarez family , but it perpetuates the message that encounters with the Chicago Police Department remain potentially lethal. ” Solano ’ s attorney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right one . “ With its ruling in the Anthony Alvarez officer-involved shooting , the Chicago Police Board has shown that is has potential to be a great force in providing civilian accountability that is both fair and just ... , ” his statement read . “ COPA , on the other hand , has proven once again that while its statutory mandate in theory could provide acceptable police oversight , in reality it is beholden to the mob mentality of the anti-police movement. ” Andrea Kersten , COPA ’ s chief administrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood by COPA ’ s investigation and findings . After the meeting , Kersten told reporters that she understands each case has its own merits . But she said COPA believes it ’ s important with cases “ of this consequence ” with large amounts of evidence that it should advance to the full Police Board instead of being up to a single member . “ We reached the conclusions we made because , based on the totality of the circumstances , ” she said . “ We felt that the officers ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to this unnecessarily and that that is a big part of the reason why we reached the sustained finding that we did , particularly with respect to the ultimate justification or lack thereof as we found to use fatal deadly force. ” Kersten said the 20-day suspension is the final decision and COPA has no avenue of recourse or appeal . Alvarez was shot while moving away from Solano , who was pursuing him and yelling at him to “ drop the gun , ” a video of the shooting released last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and footage shows Alvarez drop a pistol as he fell to the ground . He was shot in the back and thigh , an autopsy later revealed . His family filed a lawsuit in February alleging the city bears responsibility for his death partly because the Chicago Police Department did not have a policy on foot pursuits at the time . The family ’ s lawsuit states that Alvarez did not threaten the officers or anyone else , and that police had no valid reason to stop him or chase him that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different Chicago police officer fatally shot 13-year-old Adam Toledo during a foot chase . The two shootings sparked protests and prompted the city to implement a policy on foot pursuits . In April 2021 , the Civilian Office of Police Accountability had recommended to Chicago police officials that Solano be relieved of his police powers during its investigation , an action that would require the officer to forfeit his badge and gun for work purposes while assigned to paid desk duty . He was stripped of his police powers in June 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation of the Alvarez shooting . In March , Cook County State ’ s Attorney Kim Foxx announced her office would not bring criminal charges against the officers involved in the Alvarez and Toledo shootings .

Both Toledo and Alvarez were carrying guns on the nights they were shot . The Police Department released its final version of a foot pursuit policy in June , which was in the making for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toledo shootings . The policy states that officers can engage in a foot pursuit only if there “ is a valid law enforcement need to detain the person ” that outweighs the dangers of the pursuit . Officers also must not start a chase or stop one for various reasons , such as if the officer becomes injured or a third party is injured and requires immediate medical aid ; if the officer is unaware of their current location ; and if the officer loses his or her radio or firearm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is alone , he or she should not start or continue a chase . All officers will receive e-learning training on the new policy , and it will also be built into the department ’ s in-person 40 hours of mandatory training , according to police leaders .

Subject to memorization in school and known as the definitive planetary lineup , Pluto was included in the list until the International Astronomical Union determined it did not meet qualifications in 2006 .

In 2006 , the IAU voted that the definition of a planet relied on three specifications : • It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient mass so that it becomes a nearly round shape • It has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit IAU members also concurred that dwarf planets and planets are two distinct classifications . They determined the Solar System contains eight planets : Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .

This means Pluto is classified as a dwarf planet rather than a major planet like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are smaller planets that do not meet all three categories of a planet .

"Just one week after a man shot and killed three Black people in a Florida Dollar General with a rifle he decorated with swastikas, numerous prominent right-wing online influencers seemed to agree: the neo-Nazi groups that demonstrated just two hours south of that murder scene must have been part of a “false flag” operation staged by the federal government to smear their otherwise righteous conservative movements. At first glance, one might begin to wonder if these clickbait hawks could be onto something. The scenes that played out around Orlando, Florida, on Saturday were almost cartoonish, after all. Dozens of individuals, most of whom wore face coverings to conceal their identities, marched while waving flags emblazoned with swastikas, throwing up single-arm Nazi salutes, and belting out their affinity for Adolf Hitler and hatred of Jewish people. A similar but separate group of neo-Nazis made scenes at the entrance to Disney World. They had their own swastika flags and pro-Hitler signs, and they made it a point to destroy a LGBTQ+ Pride flag for the people filming them."

"Labour’s immigration policy is starting to take shape. Migration, historically, has been a tricky issue for the party.

Speaking at Labour party conference, the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, announced a new cross-border unit of hundreds of police officers to go after smugglers. Labour leader Keir Starmer has vowed to “smash the gangs”, to treat people smuggling on par with terrorism and to use serious crime orders to freeze smugglers’ assets and restrict their movement.

Yet neither Obama nor Clinton managed to alter the basic trajectory of the American economy. Income and wealth inequality, which had begun rising in the early 1980s, continued to do so.

"This is an almost wearyingly familiar narrative in our fractious republic: red-state governor declares war on “woke culture” and “critical race theory” and then force-feeds the glory of dead white males to an increasingly diverse society. South Dakota, acting at the behest of Gov. Kristi Noem, another culture warrior, was enacting the same drama as Virginia at the same time. In recent months, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who is running for president as the foe of all things “woke,” has overseen the publication of state standards for Black history that, among other things, suggested a moral equivalence between “acts of violence perpetrated against and by African Americans” during the Jim Crow era. The very effort to teach the American story, and thus turn out citizens less polarized than ourselves, runs headlong into our cultural wood-chipper. And yet … it wasn’t so simple in Virginia. Some of the Youngkin appointees wanted to see more flag-waving, but others were dismayed by the Northam curriculum’s elaborate flow charts on “Learning content THROUGH developing social science skills.” Their concern was not just over ideology but pedagogy — over how to teach, not what to teach. Andy Rotherham, an educational consultant who was first appointed to the board by Democratic Gov. Mark Warner before being appointed again by Youngkin, said that he voted for a pause in August because “there wasn’t enough content in there.” Years spent visiting classrooms had shown Rotherham that teachers who have learned precious little history in ed school are left adrift without strong moorings in historical fact. “That’s why you get these classes where everyone’s talking but no one’s saying anything about content,” as Rotherham puts it."

On June 6 , with the help of the Social Media Victims Law Center , Spence filed a lawsuit against Meta Platforms ( formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent company of Instagram , alleging that Instagram ’ s design caused these mental and physical harms . Similar lawsuits have failed in the past , mostly because social media platforms claim immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act . However , Spence ’ s lawsuit is different—and Meta should be worried . First , Spence ’ s lawsuit follows Frances Haugen ’ s disclosure of Facebook ’ s internal research , known as the Facebook Papers , that shows Meta knew its social media products are highly addicted and harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the first lawsuits to allege design defects : that certain product features and capabilities built into Instagram are fundamentally defective , and these defects caused Spence ’ s mental and physical injuries . Third , instead of alleging injuries attributable to the content uploaded to the platform by its users , it targets Instagram ’ s features and capabilities in a way that is content-neutral . In late 2021 , Haugen received international attention as the Facebook whistleblower . The Facebook Papers , which she shared with journalists and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company believed the use of its social media products could lead to serious mental health issues , such as anxiety , depression , and eating disorders . In fact , Facebook named the harms as “ Suicide and Self-Injury , ” or SSI . For instance , one of the slides released in the Facebook Papers was titled , “ But , We Make Body Image Issues Worse for 1 in 3 Teen Girls. ” While some experts have challenged the research as inconclusive , in Haugen ’ s testimony , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ potential dangers , especially to preteen and teen girls . She also discussed the Facebook Papers ’ overarching theme : Instagram ’ s success and growth depends on the acquisition and retention of tweens and teenagers . Despite Meta ’ s policy that all users must be at least 13 years of age to create an Instagram account , the Facebook Papers revealed that the company deliberately studied 10- to 12-year-olds and how they used the platform . And most importantly to Spence ’ s lawsuit , the Facebook Papers also revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Likes ” feature called Project Daisy . In the study , the control Group A kept the publicly displayed like counter , but for Group B , Facebook hid the number of likes from the user . In the end , Facebook concluded , “ Likes , comments , and Direct Messages are all very important to teens . … Teens seem very sensitive to receiving interactions and their emotions are directly correlated to the type and [ number ] of interactions they receive. ” Spence ’ s suit claims Meta is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In general , a products liability claim can take three forms : manufacturing defect , design defect , and marketing defect . A manufacturing defect may occur when , during the manufacturing process , the product deviates from the intended design , leading to harm or injury to the consumer . A design defect may occur when the design of the product itself causes harm or injury to the consumer . A marketing defect may occur when the manufacturer fails to provide proper instructions or warnings regarding the product . Other lawsuits against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it liable under products liability claims . In 2021 , in a consolidated ruling , the Texas Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of three lawsuits against Facebook that primarily alleged marketing defects . In those cases , victims of sex trafficking alleged that they became entangled with their abusers through Facebook and said that the company should be held liable for failing to warn and prevent sex trafficking . Facebook moved to dismiss these claims pursuant to Section 230 . Section 230 generally protects online platforms from legal liability for transmitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-party content . Courts have interpreted its immunity broadly , but recently , Section 230 has faced tremendous criticism from scholars , politicians , and regulators on both sides of the aisle . In the Texas cases , the state Supreme Court said Section 230 barred the claims because they were rooted in the content posted on the platform by malicious users . The lawsuits sought to impose liability on Facebook for its failure to combat or remove third-party content , which is specifically barred by Section 230 . Defenders of Section 230 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these products liability claims . For instance , the Cato Institute argued that the use of products liability claims improperly circumvents Section 230 ’ s protections . From Cato ’ s perspective , Section 230 ’ s primary beneficiary is the internet user , not the platform , because Section 230 ’ s purpose is to protect users ’ free speech rights under the First Amendment . And if plaintiffs were to prevail with their products liability claims , it would frustrate Section 230 ’ s purpose . However , not everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Professor ( and occasional Slate contributor ) Danielle Citron , who has written extensively on Section 230 , argues that its protections should not extend to activity that has little or nothing to do with free speech , such as the distribution of a dangerous product . And at least one court appears to agree . In 2021 , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that Section 230 does not shield Snapchat from liability for an alleged design defect related to its speed filter . In Lemmon v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Snap could be held liable for foreseeable injuries resulting from the use of its speed filter because the existence of this filter does not rest on any third-party content . One case that might be instructive in Spence ’ s claims against Meta is Herrick v. Grindr LLC , which sought to hold the dating app for gay men liable under a products liability claim . In that case , Matthew Herrick met J.C. on the app , and after their relationship ended , J.C. created a fake profile imitating Herrick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men to Herrick ’ s home for violent sex . Herrick reported the fake profile to Grindr and local law enforcement , but his complaints went unaddressed . So he sued Grindr and asserted that it failed to incorporate common safety features or warn of how Grindr can be used as a “ stalking weapon. ” The federal district court dismissed Herrick ’ s complaint on Section 230 grounds . On appeal , he argued that Section 230 did not bar his claims because they concerned the app ’ s design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app . But in 2019 , the 2nd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal because , as it concluded , Herrick ’ s alleged injuries were caused by the content submitted to the app by J.C. , not the app ’ s design . The causation analysis put forth in Herrick v. Grindr LLC may be the most important part for Spence ’ s lawsuit . In fact , both the Texas cases and Herrick illustrate a dispositive issue in lawsuits alleging products liability claims : whether or not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries alleged by a plaintiff . But for J.C. ’ s speech on Grindr , Herrick would not have experienced the alleged harassment and stalking . J.C. ’ s unlawful acts ( speech ) were the actual cause of Herrick ’ s alleged injuries , not Grindr ’ s acts or omissions . In the Texas cases , but for the predators ’ actions , the victims would not have become entangled in sex trafficking . Spence ’ s lawsuit against Meta , by contrast , focuses on Instagram ’ s “ Feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friend Recommendations , ” and “ Likes , ” with the latter likely being the strongest claim . Her claims can be reframed as : Regardless of the content posted on Instagram by its users , these product features and capabilities caused the injuries alleged . In Lemmon v. Snap Inc. , the availability and use of the speed filter did not depend on a third party ’ s content . In Spence ’ s case , Instagram ’ s feed , explore , and likes features similarly do not depend on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlike in the Texas cases , where the content of the sex traffickers played a significant role in entangling the victims , in Spence ’ s case , Instagram ’ s core features “ entangled ” her in the mental and physical injuries . Regardless of the content she posted or other users posted to Instagram , it was the “ Likes ” feature caused the anxiety , depression , and addiction alleged . And as Project Daisy illustrated , per the Facebook Papers , but for the Likes feature , tweens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety , depression , and addiction . Further , in Herrick , J.C. ’ s content ultimately caused the harassment and stalking against Herrick . But in Spence ’ s case , regardless of whatever content Instagram showed her , the Feed + Profile and Explore ’ s design ( e.g. , endless scrolling ) elicits the emotional response that drives the apparent addiction among tweens and teens . As Spence alleges , Meta ’ s use of psychological manipulation techniques—sometimes referred to as persuasive design—caused the well-established hallmarks of clinical addiction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct a reasonable age verification , Spence would not have been exposed to Instagram ’ s features and design . But for the likes feature , Spence would not have experienced the anxiety and depression that stem from the number of likes collected . But for the endless feed and explore features , Spence would not have experienced the clinical addiction that these features were designed to promote . While Spence ’ s case is not a slam-dunk , its focus on content-neutral features as the actual cause of Spence ’ s mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finding Meta liable . Even though Meta will likely argue that all of Spence ’ s claims are barred by Section 230 , only some of her claims—the claims that rely or depend on the content posted by third-parties—should be barred . However , her claims that rely on content-neutral features should survive . And with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California—where Spence ’ s case is filed—having a greater understanding of technology than other courts , the suit may survive Meta ’ s motion to dismiss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proper causation analysis . And it ’ s important that Spence ’ s content-neutral claims are allowed to proceed . As I ’ ve generally argued in the past , social media platforms will not change their behavior , including how they design their platforms , unless the incentive structure changes . Under the status quo , social media platforms are incentivized to maximize user engagement because it increases advertising revenues . Section 230 allows platforms to maximize user engagement without regard to any mental or physical injury that the platforms may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside whether Section 230 defenders ’ interpretation is correct or proper , the reasons for Section 230 immunity fall flat with respect to Spence ’ s lawsuit . Here , there is no speech to protect . And if the primary beneficiary of Section 230 protection is the internet user , then it follows that platforms should not be allowed to use Section 230 immunity for the harms the platforms directly cause their users . Simply put , if platforms are exposed to legal liability ( e.g. , damages ) , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of their users may suddenly align with maximizing profits or , at the very least , avoiding excess costs .

"“This is potentially an opportunity for large-scale reform that actually embraces debate, questions orthodoxies, and allows for freedom of speech,” says Greg Lukianoff, head of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. But some free speech advocates hope campuses will rededicate themselves to the First Amendment. As the Monitor reported, thinkers on both the right and left have begun to doubt the very concept of a free “marketplace of ideas.” Conservatives, especially, say that American institutions of higher education have become hostile to their ideas to the point of censure."
""""""" ( Natural News ) A coalition of lawyers and judges from all around the world has convened to prosecute the “ crimes against humanity ” perpetrated by governments and their psychopathic puppet masters in the name of “ fighting covid ” and “ saving lives. ” The international cohort , which calls itself the Peoples ’ Court of Public Opinion , gathered in Germany recently to detail the many human rights violations inflicted by corrupt politicians under the directive of the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) . “ This case , involving the most heinous crimes against humanity committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looks complicated only at first glance , ” said German attorney Dr. Reiner Fuellmich in his opening statement ( watch below ) . Fuellmich went on to highlight how the Wuhan coronavirus ( Covid-19 ) plandemic was purposely engineered by the establishment to usher humanity into a new technocratic “ great reset ” system under a centralized global power structure . “ One , there is no corona pandemic , but only a PCR test ‘ plandemic ’ fueled by an elaborate psychological operation designed to create a constant state of panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Fuellmich said . “ This agenda has been long planned. ” Covid isn ’ t about saving lives ; it ’ s about ending them Fuellmich believes that this was all tried before with swine flu , the precursor to covid .

Governments everywhere , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead pushing people to get “ vaccinated ” with experimental gene therapy needles that are spreading vaccine-induced AIDS to the “ fully vaccinated. ” “ Our governments are not our governments anymore , ” Fuellmich says . “ Rather , they have been taken over by the other side through their main platform , the World Economic Forum , which has started to create their own global leaders through their ‘ Young Global Leaders ’ program as early as 1992. ” Some of the first graduates of the Young Global Leaders program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize : billionaire eugenicist Bill Gates and corrupt German Chancellor Angela Merkel .

""""""" This retrospective population-based study leverages the IEMS data system and analyzes all calls related to CA and ACS events over two and a half years , from January 1st , 2019 , to June 20th , 2021 . The IEMS call data are coupled with data on COVID-19 infection rates , as well as the respective vaccination rates over the same period of time . The study ’ s time period spans 14 months of a ‘ normal period ’ prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout ( 1/2019–2/2020 ) , about 10 months of a ‘ pandemic period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3/2020–12/2020 ) , and about 6 months of a ‘ pandemic and vaccination period ’ ( 1/2021–6/2021 ) , during which Israel launched its vaccination rollout parallel to a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic . Thus , it allows to study how CA and ACS call counts change over time with different background conditions and potentially highlight factors that are associated with the observed temporal changes . This study was deemed exempt from review by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institutional Review Board ( E-3300 ) . The study was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IEMS . The IEMS data system includes records of all the calls received through Israel ’ s national emergency telephone number ( 1-0-1 ) . Note that the IEMS is a national organization that manages all EMS calls in Israel . Each record contains multiple fields of information , including the retrospective verified call-type as determined by the EMS team ( as opposed to the initial call classification ) , date , relevant response characteristics ( e.g. , death on scene and whether resuscitation was required during the response ) , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The study ’ s dataset includes all non-cancelled calls with reported patient age and a verified call-type of either CA or ACS . CA calls were defined as a sudden electrical malfunction of the heart of presumed cardiac or medical etiology , resulting in collapse of a patient , excluding CAs related to trauma , drug overdose , or suicide . ACS calls were defined as conditions where the patients experience a reduction in blood flow to the heart that is associated with myocardial infarction . The call codes used to identify CA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMS teams based on defined protocols of the IEMS . CA diagnosis was made based on the circumstances of collapse as described by the caller to the dispatch team , the CA victim ’ s electrocardiogram ( ECG ) as obtained through an automated external defibrillator , and common indicators of CA as observed by the responding paramedics ( e.g. , patient unresponsiveness , agonal breathing ) . CAs due or obviously related to trauma , drug overdose , or suicide were excluded in this call code and from the study . ACS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s 12-lead ECG ( a 12-lead ECG was performed on all patients suspected of ACS to confirm the diagnosis ) , symptoms ( e.g. , chest pain , shortness of breath ) , medical history , and physical examination , as obtained by the responding paramedics . Importantly , these protocol and diagnoses were the same throughout the entire study period ( 2019–2021 ) , allowing for a consistent comparison between the call counts during the baseline , pandemic , and vaccination periods . The Supplemental Methods describe the IEMS call data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail . Data on the vaccinations and COVID-19 cases were obtained from the online Israel Government Database Portal ( https : //info.data.gov.il/datagov/home/ ) . These data include the number of daily administered 1st and 2nd vaccination doses by age group , as well as the weekly number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases by age group , across all of Israel . The age groups consist of bins of 20 years starting with 0–19 . Population counts by similar age groups were also collected from publicly accessible data used to complement these datasets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which the lag between the 1st and 2nd dose is three weeks , and that during January–May 2021 , the vaccines were administered to individuals of age 16 and over . For each pair of a diagnosis ( CA or ACS ) , age group ( 16–39 , over-40 or all-ages ) , and gender ( male , female , or both genders ) the year-to-year absolute and relative changes in calls were calculated . The respective statistical significance of these changes were based on the two-tailed Poisson E-test . These changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full calendar year ( 2019–2020 ) and from January 1st to May 31st ( 2019–2021 ) . January–May time period was used for comparison as it corresponds with the administration of vaccinations among the 16–39 age group in 2021 . The full calendar year comparisons were calculated to examine the changes in calls when COVID-19 infections were prevalent , but no vaccinations were administered among the 16–39 age group . Additional analyses describing the percent of CA calls where the patient died on scene ( i.e. , death declared prior to hospital arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient received defibrillation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation ) are outlined in the Appendix . To visualize the temporal trends of CA and ACS call volume and potential relationship to COVID-19 infection rates and vaccination rates for the 16–39 age group , graphs were created for CA and ACS calls , respectively . Each graph overlays several moving-average time-series over the study period . These include the five-week centered moving-average of the respective weekly EMS call counts , as well as the three-week centered moving-average counts of new COVID-19 infection cases , administered 1st vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The graphs also indicate the periods of the three national COVID-19-related public health lockdown advisories in Israel40 . To improve the understanding these trends during the third pandemic wave and vaccination rollout , ‘ zoom-in ’ graphs were similarly created for the time-period October 18th , 2020 , through June 20th , 2021 . The zoom-in graphs also highlight estimates of the number of individuals who only received one vaccination dose during this time . This was done by plotting an additional time-series of the three-week moving-average of the administered 2nd vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . More precisely , the difference between the number of 1st vaccine doses and the number of 2nd vaccine doses shifted backwards in time by three weeks shows the estimated number of patients that only received their 1st dose following Pzifer ’ s vaccination administration recommendations ( i.e. , the estimated number of patients who did not received a 2nd vaccine dose after a 3-week period following 1st vaccine dose administration ) . This difference is also used to estimated number of single doses administered to individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st , 2021 , onwards ( April 1st 2021 was shortly after the Israel Ministry of Health approved vaccination for this population41 ) . Graphs for the above-40 and all-ages groups are shown in Supplemental Figs . 1–4 . Time-series data processing for CA and ACS call , vaccination administration , and COVID-19 infection counts To check whether the observed year-to-year trends in weekly counts of CA and ACS calls among the 16–39 age group are associated with either COVID-19 infections or vaccine administration , the following weekly time-series were calculated and considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly call counts , respectively , for patients in age groups 16–39 and over-40 ; ACS weekly call counts of patients in age group 16–39 ; bi-weekly ( current and prior week ) cumulative counts of 1st and 2nd vaccine doses administered , respectively , in age groups 16–39 and over-40 ; and cumulative three-week ( current and prior two weeks ) new COVID-19 infection counts in age groups 16–39 ( approximated by age group 0–39 ) and over-40 , respectively . Note that the COVID-19 infection dataset37 only includes aggregated data for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of COVID-19 infections for the age group 16–39 . The choice of bi-weekly counts of 1st and 2nd vaccine doses is motivated by studies that suggest myocarditis typically appears within two weeks from vaccination19 . The choice of three-week cumulative counts of new COVID-19 infections is motivated by the fact that acute symptoms of COVID-19 are typically observed within three weeks of infection onset19 . Since the impact of COVID-19 might be variable , some of the analysis described below was conducted also with different COVID-19 new infection counts varying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( i.e. , cumulative counts between one , two , three , four , five and six weeks ) . Association of year-to-year call count trends with COVID-19 infections and vaccine administration The Spearman rank correlation was calculated between the time-series of CA weekly call counts for the age group 16–39 and the time-series of the bi-weekly ( current and prior week ) cumulative counts of 1st and 2nd vaccine doses administered for the same age group . Similarly , the rank correlation was calculated between the time-series of the CA weekly call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cumulative three-week ( current and prior two weeks ) new COVID-19 infection counts . The same was calculated for the sum of the time-series of CA and ACS weekly call counts for the 16–39 age group ( i.e. , correlation with the respective time-series of vaccine dose and new COVID-19 infection counts ) . As mentioned previously , the bi-weekly and three-week cumulative counts for the vaccinations and COVID-19 infections , respectively , were determined based on prior literature suggesting adverse events occur within those respective durations of time19 . A post hoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( version 3.1.9.7 ) 42 to determine the statistical power ( i.e. , the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis , concluding an effect is found , and avoiding a Type II error , when an effect truly exists ) of the correlation analyses . Finally , since the impact of COVID-19 might occur across a variable period of time , the same analysis was repeated with respect to the time-series of new COVID-19 infections count but varying the cumulative count period from the original three-weeks to a range between one to six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association between weekly CA and ACS counts , vaccine administration and COVID-19 infections , and control for cross interactions and other factors , two Negative Binomial regression models43 were developed .

Such models can also be designed to use cumulative historical count data as features to estimate outcome counts during a given current time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to as Model 1 , regresses the respective time-series of the CA weekly call counts and the ACS weekly call counts in the age group 16–39 ( the dependent variable ) , against the time-series of the bi-weekly cumulative vaccine dose counts and three-week cumulative new COVID-19 infection counts , both in age group 16–39 normalized by the respective population size ( independent variables ) . The model also controls for the different diagnoses ( CA versus ACS ) , for weeks included in periods of national public health lockdown , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. , due to population growth ) in calls through respective dummy variables . Similarly , the second model , hereinafter referred to as Model 2 , regresses the respective time-series of CA weekly counts of age groups 16–39 and over-40 ( the dependent variable ) against the time-series of the bi-weekly cumulative vaccine dose counts and three-week cumulative new COVID-19 infection counts in the respective age groups , again normalized by the respective population size ( independent variables ) . Additionally , instead of the dummy variable used in Model 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Model 2 introduces a dummy variable to capture the different age groups ( 16–39 and over-40 ) . To identify the most statistically significant predictors , the models use bidirectional stepwise feature selection based on the model ’ s Bayesian information criterion ( BIC ) .

During each step of the selection algorithm , features are tested to be added or removed to minimize the model ’ s BIC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) , representing the estimated change in weekly calls per unit change of each predictor variable , were reported both for the final model after stepwise BIC selection and the full model without variable selection . Model development was performed using R version 4.0.2 .

""""""" The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a New York state law that had restricted who could obtain a permit to carry a gun in public . Under the law in place since 1913 , New York residents needed to show proper cause , or an actual need , to carry a concealed handgun in public for self-defense.. The justices said that law conflicts with the Second Amendment 's right to bear arms . It drew swift reaction from New York Gov .

Some of those cases eventually could make their way to the nation 's high court . A rundown of the similar laws in the other states , reaction to the Supreme Court ruling and what could happen next : The court ’ s ruling will likely affect California ’ s strict permitting laws , said California ’ s attorney general and gun owners ’ rights organizations . Attorney General Rob Bonta told California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month that “ given California ’ s similar , ‘ good cause ’ standard , the decision may impact California laws regarding the carrying of firearms in public places. ” He said many aspects of California ’ s law might remain untouched , despite the ruling . Nearly two-thirds of California ’ s 58 counties already eased their standards for granting concealed weapons permits after a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the state ’ s concealed carry standard in 2014 , said attorney Chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pistol Association . They kept the more permissive standard even after a larger appellate panel reversed the decision two years later , said Michel , who wrote a book on California ’ s strict gun laws . At issue is the standard that local officials — usually sheriffs , but sometimes police chiefs — use when considering who should be allowed to carry a concealed weapon outside the house . Gun rights advocates say the court overturning the New York law means California must join the 43 states that have what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those generally require officials to issue permits unless there is some reason that an individual should be denied . Of California ’ s 58 counties , 37 already grant permits if an applicant requests it for self defense . That effectively makes them “ shall issue ” counties , advocates said . The other 21 counties have tighter standards , for example requiring applicants to demonstrate that they have business-related or professional risks that justify them being armed . The Supreme Court decision “ not only affirms that laws prohibiting licensed public concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , but also that courts have been applying the wrong approach to evaluating the constitutionality of gun control laws , ” Michel said . Michel ’ s organization plans to immediately send the 21 counties legal notices that they must ease their standards in light of the Supreme Court ’ s decision . He also plans to ask the 9th Circuit to rule on his latest legal challenge to California ’ s “ good cause ” standard , a decision that has been on hold awaiting the U. S. Supreme Court ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sam Paredes , executive director of Gun Owners of California , said his organization expects to quickly sue California to force it to adopt the standard set in the New York decision , and to sue local jurisdictions if they don ’ t adopt the high court ’ s ruling . Hawaii has among the strictest gun laws in the nation . So strict , said attorney Alan Beck , that Hawaii essentially bans carrying guns outside the home . It has been practically impossible to get a permit to carry a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the past 22 years , there have been four permits issued in Hawaii , said Beck , who represents various residents challenging Hawaii gun laws . The state attorney general ’ s office has argued that it ’ s not a flat-out ban because people can carry firearms if they have “ good cause. ” County police chiefs in Hawaii have had the discretion in determining whether to issue a carry permit , something the Supreme Court now says is too restrictive . Without a carry permit , people have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can transport them – unloaded and locked up – to firing ranges and other limited locations such as for repairs . One of Beck ’ s clients is George Young , a Big Island resident who wants to carry a gun for self-defense . Young doesn ’ t care if it ’ s concealed or open carry . The favorable ruling in the New York case means Young ’ s lawsuit would prevail , Beck said . The Hawaii Rifle Association anticipates that lawmakers now will work to make it difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s outrageous training requirements or exorbitant fees , ” said Kainoa Kaku , the association ’ s president . “ We ’ re prepared to train potential concealed carry permit holders for whatever ridiculous requirements the state is going to ask of them , ” Kaku said . State Sen. Chris Lee said lawmakers have been getting ready by introducing bills in the last couple of years that would establish training for those who are licensed to carry weapons . He called Thursday 's ruling frustrating . “ I think there ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how states can intervene and ensure public safety , ” he said , adding that lawmakers will be looking at screening , training requirements and ways to keep guns out of public spaces . Chris Marvin , a Hawaii resident with Everytown for Gun Safety , said lawmakers also could consider legislation that carefully vets applicants for a carry permit and rules to keep guns out of locations such as protests , polling places , state land and schools . Allowing nearly all civilians to carry guns would be a big cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ We live in a place that a lot of people call paradise , and they ’ re usually talking about the weather . But from a safety standpoint and violence standpoint , we live in a place that is a relative paradise to the rest of the country , '' he said . `` We are not perfect and we certainly have our share of violent incidences , but it would be really strange to be walking down Waikiki Beach and see someone with a side arm visibly on their hip. ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Maryland has to show a “ good or substantial reason ” to carry a concealed gun . That could include showing a person ’ s life is in danger from threats or that they work in a job that could put them in contact with people who are dangerous . Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said the laws are similar to New York 's , but they take different approaches . He said he was examining today 's ruling to determine its impact on the state . “ Today ’ s decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country already awash in gun violence , '' Frosh said in a statement . `` If the norm is that people can carry firearms , our neighborhoods , our streets and other public places will become more dangerous . It will make the lives of law enforcement more difficult and more perilous . “ The epidemic of gun violence sweeping our nation demonstrates daily the folly of introducing more guns into this boiling cauldron. ” Opponents to the law in Maryland already have sued , in a case that has been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Appeals , pending the ruling in the New York case . Mark Pennak , president of Maryland Shall Issue , a gun-rights group that is challenging the Maryland law , said the group is “ absolutely ecstatic ” about the court ’ s ruling . “ It confirms what we ’ ve always believed — that the right of self-defense extends outside the home , ” he said . Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson and House Speaker Adrienne Jones , who are both Democrats , said they will review the ruling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . “ More guns in public means more violence , and more violence means more death and heartache everywhere . This is the wrong answer , '' they said in a joint statement . “ The Second Amendment permits reasonable restrictions on the right to carry a firearm. ” Massachusetts ’ law had given local police chiefs the power to decide whether someone is suitable to have a license to carry a handgun . Police chiefs have been able to deny applicants if they determine that the person would pose a risk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history of domestic violence . Those who are denied can appeal to their local district court . The law says those deemed suitable can get a license to carry if they show “ good reason to fear injury ” to themselves or their property “ or for any other reason , ” including “ for use in sport or target practice only. ” What ’ s considered a “ good reason ” has been up to police chiefs , who vary in what they require of applicants to meet that standard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reason to fear injury that distinguishes them from the general population in order to get an unrestricted license . Massachusetts courts have ruled that if someone can ’ t show a “ good reason to fear injury , ” police chiefs can put restrictions on licenses that limit when someone can carry a firearm . State Attorney General Maura Healey said Thursday that she stands by the state ’ s “ commonsense gun laws and will continue to vigorously defend and enforce them. ” The office has not responded to questions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts ’ law will be affected by the ruling . Jason Guida , former director of the Massachusetts Firearms Records Bureau who now works as a lawyer representing gun owners , said state laws restricting the carry of guns outside the home will now be challenged and likely overturned .

State Rep. David Linksy , a Democrat who has advocated for gun control measures , said he is still examining the ruling but is deeply concerned about its potential effect on police chiefs ’ ability to use their discretion when issuing gun licenses . “ The end result is there will be an increase in gun violence , '' he said . “ There will be people killed , there will be people injured , and we will all be less safe. ” A federal judge wrote in a 2017 case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects ” less restrictive than New York ’ s because Massachusetts allows — but doesn ’ t demand— that police chiefs require applicants to “ demonstrate a special need for self-defense before being issued an unrestricted license. ” Democratic state Rep. Michael Day , House chair of the Legislature ’ s Judiciary Committee , said lawmakers have a range of choices depending on the specifics of the court ruling . “ All options are on the table , ” he said . New Jersey residents no longer must prove “ justifiable need ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court ’ s decision Thursday , but permits are still required , the state ’ s top law enforcement officer said . Acting Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a phone interview that the high court ’ s ruling in the New York state case “ effectively struck down ” New Jersey ’ s requirement that residents seeking carry permits show they face significant threats and have a justifiable need to get a carry permit . But , he added , the other requirements under New Jersey law still stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibition against certain convicts . As for how soon the change goes into effect , Platkin said he will issue guidance “ imminently. ” New Jersey ’ s gun laws are among the tightest in the nation and got even stricter after former Republican Gov .

Getting a carry permit in New Jersey is widely considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ justifiable need ” requirement paralleled New York ’ s “ proper cause ” provision that was just thrown out by the high court . “ Based on a deeply flawed constitutional methodology , a right-wing majority on the United States Supreme Court has just said that states can no longer decide for ourselves how best to limit the proliferation of firearms in the public sphere , '' he said . Gun rights advocates in New Jersey hailed the ruling . Scott Bach , executive director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spells the end for New Jersey ’ s decades-long interference with the peoples ’ fundamental right of self-defense with a firearm outside the home. ” Gun rights groups already are challenging New Jersey ’ s right-to-carry laws in courts , as well as the magazine limit .

"Kevin McCarthy will return from his August recess on Tuesday facing the latest in a long series of conundrums for the Republican House leader: should he force a government shutdown, leaving hundreds of thousands of government workers without a paycheck, or burn more bridges with the hard-right flank of his conference, risking his speakership in the process? With just 12 legislative days left before the end of the fiscal year, the Republican-controlled House must quickly pass some kind of spending package to keep the federal government open after 30 September. If the chamber does not approve a spending bill, the government will shut down for the first time in nearly five years, furloughing federal employees and stalling many crucial programs. McCarthy has indicated his preference to pass a continuing resolution, which would keep the government funded at its current levels for a short period of time as lawmakers continue to negotiate over a longer-term deal. But members of the hard-right House freedom caucus, who are still furious over the deal that McCarthy and President Joe Biden struck to suspend the debt ceiling earlier this year, insist they will not back a continuing resolution unless the speaker agrees to several significant policy concessions, such as increased border security and an impeachment inquiry into Biden."
"The “state of democracy” has been a popular discourse in recent years, to put it mildly. There’s a whole genre of books and think pieces about all the threats to democracy — both here and abroad — and how to save it. But the majority of that work focuses on the familiar dangers we’ve all come to appreciate, like polarization or authoritarianism or election denialism. That’s all good and very much worth discussing. What you don’t see quite as often are actual defenses of democracy as an idea and a way of life. It’s almost like this is just taken for granted. But if democracy really is in danger, then we could probably use more reminders of why it’s worth defending in the first place. Enter a new book by Astra Taylor called The Age of Insecurity: Coming Together as Things Fall Apart. Taylor is a writer, filmmaker, and activist, as well as one of the co-founders of the Debt Collective."

""""""" A handful of Republicans on Capitol Hill and in state capitals around the country have led the charge in pushing for government bans of the social media app TikTok because of its ties to the Chinese government , but Democrats this week have begun to jump on board as well . Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi , D-Ill. , on Tuesday became the first Democrat in Congress to endorse a national ban on TikTok , signing on as a sponsor to a bill put forward last month by Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , and Rep. Mike Gallagher , R-Wis. “ At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our other adversaries abroad are seeking any advantage they can find against the United States through espionage and mass surveillance , it is imperative that we do not allow hostile powers to potentially control social media networks that could be easily weaponized against us , ” Krishnamoorthi said in a statement . “ The bipartisan ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act is a strong step in protecting our nation from the nefarious digital surveillance and influence operations of totalitarian regimes , ” he said . “ Recent revelations surrounding the depth of TikTok ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protecting Americans from these risks before it ’ s too late. ” Rubio is the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee . The Democratic chair of that panel , Sen. Mark Warner , D-Va. , has not signed on to a national ban yet , but he indicated Tuesday that he is warming to the idea . In a video press conference with local media from his home state , Warner said that while he may have some slight differences with details in Rubio ’ s bill , the main reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is waiting for the Justice Department to agree on a technical compromise with TikTok that would protect the data of American users . “ The Justice Department under the Biden administration has been promising for over a year that they have a way to separate ByteDance — which is the Chinese owner of TikTok — and protect the data ” of American users from the Chinese government , Warner said . “ But they have taken a year plus , they still do n't have an answer , which I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be a technical answer to provide those protections. ” “ My patience with the Justice Department is running thin , ” Warner said . “ Senator Rubio and I have worked a lot on this . I would take probably a different legislative approach , but if we do n't get a solution out of the Justice Department , some type of legislative approach may very well be necessary. ” To date , Republican governors in South Carolina , Oklahoma , Nebraska , South Dakota , Texas , Maryland and Utah have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on government devices . Warner also told Yahoo News that he thinks more states need to follow suit . “ I think it ’ s absolutely appropriate that more states are prohibiting employees from having TikTok on their government-issued devices , ” Warner said in a statement provided to Yahoo News . “ TikTok is legally beholden to the Chinese Communist Party , and not only does it collect an alarming amount of information on users , but it could one day be used as a kind of propaganda machine to sway the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Gov . Kathy Hochul , a Democrat , has blocked TikTok from most state employee devices for two years , said Scott Reif , a spokesman for the Office of Information Technology Services ( ITS ) of New York . “ New York State blocks the use of TikTok on ITS-issued mobile devices . We recognize that social media platforms have become integral to the way we communicate and share information , and to that end , there is extremely limited use of TikTok including for approved social media presences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We join those calling on the federal government to take a comprehensive approach to address the significant security and privacy concerns related to TikTok. ” Warner said that there are conversations in Virginia about whether a ban for state employees should be spearheaded by Gov . Glenn Youngkin , a Republican , or the Legislature — which is split between Democratic control of the state Senate and Republican control of the House of Delegates . Rubio told Yahoo News that Democratic hesitation is to some degree due to the Biden administration ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TikTok . “ I am glad to see states taking action against TikTok , but for this to be successful we need a federal ban . Democrats who understand the security risks can not continue deferring to the Biden Administration , ” Rubio said in a statement provided to Yahoo News . “ I hope more will follow Rep. Krishnamoorthi ’ s lead because this needs to be a bipartisan effort to succeed. ” Momentum to act against TikTok has picked up steam in recent weeks following comments made last month by FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Homeland Security Committee . Wray told lawmakers he was “ extremely concerned ” about “ the possibility that the Chinese government could use [ TikTok ] to control data collection on millions of users , or control the recommendation algorithm , which could be used for influence operations if they so chose , or to control software on millions of devices , which gives it opportunity to potentially technically compromise personal devices. ” Wray reiterated these concerns during a question-and-answer session after a speech at the University of Michigan on Dec. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a government that doesn ’ t share our values , and that has a mission that ’ s very much at odds with what ’ s in the best interests of the United States , ” Wray said . “ That should concern us. ” China ’ s ability to track American citizens and collect data on their behavior through TikTok has been a concern for some time . “ As the Chinese law dictates , a Chinese company has to be loyal first to the Communist Party of China , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that ought to be a giant red flag , ” Warner said Tuesday . But Warner , who has access to top-secret intelligence thanks to his position as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said he is increasingly “ more concerned ” with the Chinese government ’ s ability to use TikTok as a tool of propaganda and misinformation to influence and manipulate the American public . “ I am deeply concerned , ” Warner said . He used the example of Taiwan , a country that China has long wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the world could end up having TikTok — and particularly to young people around the country and around the world — where suddenly they only get images that pop up that say Taiwan 's part of China , that promotes Chinese foreign policy , Chinese Communist Party foreign policy , ” Warner said .

"The federal Conservatives are already making hay over a Liberal MP’s decision to break rank and vote for a Conservative opposition day motion to repeal the carbon price. Liberal MP Ken McDonald has voted against his party on carbon pricing before. But this time, he went further with an appearance on CBC News’ Power & Politics program to explain why and criticize his party’s approach to carbon pricing in Atlantic Canada. McDonald said his constituents are losing faith in the Liberals and that federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault is not the right messenger for carbon pricing in Atlantic provinces. “If an election were called today, I'm not sure if the Liberal Party would actually form the government,” said McDonald. When he broke rank and voted for the motion to repeal the carbon tax on Oct. 4, Conservative MPs gave McDonald a standing ovation. The Opposition wasted no time highlighting McDonald’s vote during question period on Oct. 6. Then, immediately after oral questions, multiple Conservative MPs tried — unsuccessfully — to table a transcript of McDonald’s comments about carbon pricing from Power & Politics. McDonald is not the only Liberal MP concerned about the carbon price’s impact on residents in Atlantic Canada. Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre’s opposition day motion to repeal the carbon tax explicitly referred to “Atlantic Liberal” MPs who “allege they are not in favour” of the policy while continuing to support it over the years. During the Sept. 28 debate on Poilievre’s motion, Nova Scotia MP Kody Blois emphasized that he supports carbon pricing and believes in its intent but thinks adjustments are needed to better reflect his constituents’ realities. Sun and wind are key to a bright energy future Multiple Atlantic Liberal MPs came together to advocate for these adjustments at the Liberals’ national caucus meeting in September. New Brunswick MP Serge Cormier declined an interview request, but his office staff shared a Sept. 28 press release sent to provincial media in which he and fellow New Brunswick MPs René Arseneault and Wayne Long outlined their concerns about carbon pricing in the province. Some Liberal MPs in Atlantic Canada are calling on their government to make adjustments to soften the impact on the region's large rural population and one recently took his advocacy a step further & supported a CPC motion to repeal the #CarbonTax In the release, the three Liberals say the federal carbon tax, which came into force in New Brunswick in July, “puts the province and its people at a disadvantage because it does not take into account the fact that it is largely rural.” The federal carbon pricing system gives families in rural areas a 10 per cent increase on their rebate, which is delivered to Canadians every three months. Cormier, Arseneault and Blois want to double the rural supplement so rural residents receive a 20 per cent top-up. Arseneault, who represents Madawaska-Restigouche, said he supports the underlying principles of carbon pricing, but the big problem is “transportation options are virtually non-existent” for his rural constituents. Without reliable public transit or enough electric vehicle charging stations, people have “no alternative to using their cars every day,” he said. The three New Brunswick MPs also called for the federal government to study the carbon price’s impact in their province and in rural Canada “to see if any more adjustments should be made.”"
"McCarthy’s conservative critics are envisioning a future without him, now that their longtime ally Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is running for speaker in a two-man race against Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.). Even some long-time McCarthy supporters have already endorsed a possible successor. Still, there’s a contingency of the House GOP that is unhappy with either choice. And some of them are using the attack in Israel to argue that McCarthy should be back at the helm. Others are wondering if the head-to-head speaker matchup slated this week — should it fail to find a consensus candidate who can reach 218 votes on the floor — will create an opening for others they find more palatable. One possibility being floated is putting interim Speaker Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) in the job permanently. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), a McCarthy supporter, told reporters on Monday that he wants to see the former speaker take back the gavel: “I believe he is the right person to lead.”"

"This week three separate independent reports have exposed the extent of the unnecessary damage voter ID has wrought to our democracy. Voter ID was rushed through for the local elections in May which meant voters needed to produce a government-approved form of identification before they voted. An interim report by the Electoral Commission published earlier this year showed that at least 14,000 people were prevented from casting their vote, after being turned away from polling stations and not returning. Further reports this week by the Electoral Commission, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Democracy and the Constitution, and the Local Government Information Unit, have now shed further light on how this policy has affected voters. “some people found it harder than others to show accepted voter ID, including disabled people and the unemployed”"
"The ruling party, which held a divisive conference this week, has been in power for 13 years but is struggling in opinion polls.

The original quote from Cai , as published by the state-run Beijing Daily , read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years , Beijing will unremittingly grasp the normalization of epidemic prevention and control. ” The rest of the article made it clear that Cai was talking about the harsh lockdowns of residential compounds , districts , and entire cities that have plagued China this year , most notoriously in Shanghai .

""""""" The argument that Jackson ’ s light on sex offenses , already vocally rebutted by Democrats , is expected to be a leading GOP charge against Jackson when her hearings begin Monday . Although Durbin ’ s been preparing for this moment ever since he joined the Judiciary panel , he was still gobsmacked at Hawley ’ s line of questioning . The GOP messaging whiplash is a reality check for Democrats as they prepare for their first Supreme Court confirmation hearings under President Joe Biden , who once wielded Durbin ’ s committee gavel . It ’ s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator to endorse former President Barack Obama ’ s 2008 campaign to become the first Black president is now steering a historic Black nominee through a raucous Senate committee . There ’ s where Durbin ’ s genial forbearance comes in , with a reputation as a pragmatic liberal with close relationships across the aisle . This week ’ s committee hearings will test those alliances , as he wrangles a crop of Republicans who are mulling a White House run in 2024 and looking to use Jackson ’ s confirmation to boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Capitol suite , Durbin described lockstep Republican attempts to disqualify Jackson as the “ enduring obstacle ” he ’ s gearing up for during four grueling days of hearings . He ’ s had some time to prepare ; at age 77 , the Illinoisan has served more than 17 years as the No . 2 Senate Democrat and waited close to 40 years in Congress before becoming a full committee chair . “ Seniority is sometimes fickle , and difficult , ” Durbin said . “ But to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for its greatest constitutional responsibility , advice and consent , is something that was worth the journey. ” His path to Judiciary chair opened when California Sen. Dianne Feinstein stepped down as the top Democrat on the panel following Justice Amy Coney Barrett ’ s confirmation hearings . Durbin beat out a colleague for the right to simultaneously hold both the whip job and lead the powerful committee , two positions he intends to keep in the next Congress — “ God willing. ” After former President Donald Trump installed three Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only potential justice both Biden and Durbin get to work on together . And for weeks after Biden tapped her , leadership-aligned Republicans treated Jackson ’ s confirmation as all but guaranteed . Sen. John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) ’ s prediction : “ I won ’ t call it a snoozer but it may be close to that. ” Now there are signs things could get ugly as Republicans hone in on Jackson ’ s record on child porn sentencing and her representation of detainees held on terrorism-related charges at Guantanamo Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sentencing record , noting that it ’ s in line with other federal judges , and touting endorsements from law enforcement groups and survivors of crimes . With as many as four prospective Republican presidential contenders sitting opposite him on the committee dais , Durbin will have his work cut out for him . He said he ’ s “ counting on ” help from his fellow Midwesterner and ranking Republican , Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley . Durbin considers Grassley a friend , and they worked closely together on criminal justice reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) countless times on immigration . “ Dick Durbin has the goodwill on both sides of the aisle , ” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer . “ That ’ s a tremendous help. ” Most Republicans on the Judiciary Committee say they get along with Durbin despite his progressive record . Even so , they complain about Jackson ’ s quick confirmation schedule and Durbin spurning document requests related to her tenure on the U.S . Sentencing Commission . Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes Durbin personally but lamented that it ’ s “ disappointing just how partisan the Judiciary Committee has been under him. ” As for the confirmation hearing , Cruz added : “ The Democrats believe right now that they have the votes .

Those stakes make it essential that neither Jackson nor Durbin stumble . Republicans argue that Jackson ’ s hearings will not be a repeat of the contentious sexual assault allegations that faced now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation , charges he vehemently denied . Some of Durbin ’ s Democrats are skeptical . “ The focus of this is to get her confirmed , and that ’ s the priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D-R.I. ) , Durbin ’ s onetime rival for the Judiciary gavel . ” Not to have this devolve into a shouting match about Joe Biden ’ s toughness on crime. ” Grassley did offer one piece of advice for Durbin to keep committee Republicans in line : It can be easier to let chatty senators go over their allotted time during the hearings . “ Because you spend more time arguing with them , shutting them up , ” the Iowan said , “ than just letting them talk. ” Durbin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president tapped Jackson . But the senator never expressed a preference for a specific nominee , even though Biden encouraged Durbin and others to offer him names : “ I thought it was best that he make the decision , ” Durbin recalled . He won ’ t concede the coming days may be the pinnacle of his career , in part because he still holds out longshot hopes for immigration reform . He sought to include provisions to protect young immigrants , known as Dreamers , in Democrats ’ now-defunct social spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any path to legal status rejected three times by the Senate parliamentarian . Just as he ’ s hopeful Jackson can attract Republican votes , he ’ s now engaging with Cornyn and Sen. Thom Tillis ( R-N.C. ) to see if he can get an immigration deal . When it comes to immigration , Durbin said , “ I don ’ t want to hear the word reconciliation , ” referring to the budgetary rules that can allow for the Senate to sidestep a filibuster . “ That holds up false hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there anything we can do on the subject of immigration that can win 60 votes in the Senate ? We ’ re going to test that. ” Yet Jackson ’ s confirmation may be his best chance at a highlight-reel victory for the foreseeable future . “ It ’ s almost a culmination , ” said Sen.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — The day before he was ousted, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was doing what he loved — stopping to greet tourists at the Capitol, gushing about the beauty of the place and its history at the center of American democracy. On Wednesday, McCarthy’s House was shuttered, his Republican majority in chaos and unable to legislate for the foreseeable future, with grave ramifications for the U.S. experiment in governing. With no speaker of the House, a constitutional officer second in line to the presidency, the Congress cannot fully function — to pass laws, fund the government and otherwise serve as the branch of government closest to the people — during a time of simmering uncertainty at home and abroad."

""""""" School shootings feel random in their location yet predictable in their occurrence . Killers target elementary , high school and college students in urban , suburban and rural communities . The children killed are Hispanic , white , Black , Asian , Native American , gay , straight , transgender and cisgender . This year school shootings have occurred more than weekly on average , with 27 in 2022 ( so far ) . Many go virtually unmentioned on the national stage , however , until the “ unthinkable ” happens , and 19 nine- to 11-year-old children and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School in Uvalde , Tex . Yet these killings aren ’ t unthinkable . We ’ ve been here before—at Columbine , Sandy Hook , Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Fla. , and too many other schools . We are researchers and pediatric emergency medicine physicians who study firearm injuries . After many hard , politically fraught years of investigating this subject , we believe that it is our collective responsibility to address , head on , the interlinked issues of gun availability , gun safety , gun regulations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it , the politicization of guns taking priority over public health . With thousands of children killed each year in the U.S. by firearms , we must , as a country , ultimately reckon with the essential question of what is most important : Is it the narrow focus on individuals ’ rights or the broader vision of societal responsibility ? Are pediatric gun deaths really a problem in the U.S. ? Our work and others ’ show the answer is unequivocally yes . Guns kill more U.S. children and adolescents between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other means . Guns kill more children than motor vehicle collisions , cancer , infections or any other disease . And this is a uniquely American problem . Though horrifying and sensational , school deaths represent only a small fraction firearm deaths . Most firearm injuries and deaths happen in homes or neighborhoods . In 2020 10,197 children and young adults age zero to 24 year old died by guns , a 55 percent increase over the decade prior . Gun deaths are also a health disparity issue . Over the past decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at rates about five times higher than those of white teenage boys , though their names rarely register in the national consciousness . There are at least 400 million guns in the U.S. We don ’ t really know how many because most states don ’ t track gun sales or require gun registration , thanks to successful lobbying by the gun industry and progun politicians . Last year 18.9 million guns were sold in the U.S. And between the beginning of 2019 and middle of 2021 , an estimated 7.5 million people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.4 million people who previously lived in homes without guns . Twenty years ago a majority of gun owners used guns for hunting and sports . Today 88 percent of them state they own their guns for self-protection . Most of those owners say having a gun at home makes them feel safer , and about 40 percent keep one loaded and “ easily accessible ” at all times . In 2021 four in 10 children , representing approximately 30 million kids , had at least one gun in the home . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these guns were stored unlocked and/or loaded , putting those children at risk of injury and death . If you keep a gun in your home , storing it unloaded and keeping the gun and ammunition locked away separately can decrease the risk . Unlike cars and virtually every product sold in the U.S. , there are no regulatory safety requirements for guns . That bears repeating : guns are exempt from safety standards set by the federal Consumer Product Safety Act . Between 2015 and 2021 , there were 2,446 unintentional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1,603 injuries . Thus , while pill bottle makers , hair dryer producers and motor vehicle companies constantly work to improve their products ’ safety , the U.S. government has decreed gun manufactures do not need to consider whether a two-year-old should be able to pull the trigger on a gun or whether a teenager should be able to fire a gun they don ’ t own . Beyond these lack of safety requirements , in 2006 Congress passed the “ Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act , ” which shields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or deaths from guns . Thus , gunmakers have minimal incentive to improve gun safety technology , despite the development of safer gun technology over the last decade in the form of personalized “ smart ” guns , which use fingerprint technology ( like your cell phone , radio-frequency identification ( RFID ) or other methods to allow only the authorized user to fire the gun . This simple fix would prevent curious children , suicidal individuals and unauthorized people from finding a gun and shooting the weapon . It would save countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states with stronger firearm laws are associated with lower firearm deaths . We also know no one law or strategy will address the problem of U.S. gun violence . We need a multipronged strategy , and we need it to encompass all states . One approach would treat owning guns like owning cars : meaningful age limits for purchase and possession and licensing , registration and insurance requirements . Some states , including New York , Connecticut and California , do have meaningful age limits and licensing and registration requirements . Other states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rhode Island , specifically prohibit gun registries . Nearly two thirds of Americans , including 53 percent of Republicans , support moderate or strong regulation of gun ownership . And after every school shooting , federal firearm legislation , such as universal background checks or raising the legal age to buy a long gun from 18 to 21 , is proposed once again . It is the most practical start to decreasing firearm deaths , yet the most quickly dismissed . So we are left with “ thoughts and prayers. ” We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firearms among individuals at risk of harming themselves or others ( such as people who have been charged with domestic violence or who have homicidal ideation ) . These needed measures include universal background checks ( supported by 81 percent of Americans ) and extreme risk protection order ( “ red flag ” ) laws that allow a judge to prohibit at-risk individuals ’ purchase or possession of a firearm for a time limited period . Nineteen states plus Washington , D.C. , have red flag laws . These laws are frequently passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet people slip through the cracks , so we need to both increase awareness of the laws in the states that have them and to have more states pass them . As pediatric emergency physicians , we specifically concern ourselves with children accessing their parents ’ guns . Strong child access prevention laws , currently in 34 states and Washington , D.C. , hold adult gun owners liable if a child can or does access a firearm . But we and others have concerns about criminalizing grieving families and nondiscriminatory applications of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentivize gun owners to store their firearms more safely . And then there is funding . Because of a dearth of federal research funding , there are substantial gaps in knowledge about the victims and perpetrators of gun violence , as well as effective interventions . There was no Congressional federal funding for firearm research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after Congress passed the Dickey Amendment in 1996—and no such funding for the National Institutes of Health after the amendment was extended to that agency in late 2011—until 2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a drop in the bucket , compared with the number of people affected by gun violence . In contrast , the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute has a budget of $ 3.8 billion to support research related to conditions such as heart disease and cancer . But while we consider these approaches , we must remember these names . They are sons and daughters , children whose parents had hopes and dreams for them , youth with goals and aspirations for themselves : And never again should we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children shot and killed in their elementary school . Yet history , and a contemptuous lack of action from our elected officials , predicts we will . We must demand more , especially when there are actions we can take .

"Crisis awareness among the population has risen significantly on the issue of migration, but has declined on other issues. A perceived division of society, meanwhile, remains at a high level with noticeable differences depending on party preference. And 15 per cent could imagine voting for a ""Wagenknecht"" Party. These are the core results of the latest survey conducted by the University of Freiburg's Political Panel Germany between September 28 and October 8, 2023 with 10,038 participants surveyed. The surveys were conducted by Prof. Dr. Uwe Wagschal and Dr. Sebastian Jäckle from the Department of Political Science in collaboration with Dr. James Kenneth Timmis, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Crisis awareness regarding migration reaches the level from 2015 Compared to the last panel wave in January 2023 crisis awareness with regard to migration has increased by 16 percentage points and has returned to the level seen in 2015. Now, 55.7 per cent of respondents consider immigration and migration to be fairly or very threatening. Germans currently see only the war in Ukraine as more threatening (57.2 per cent of respondents, previously 76.8 per cent). Strong concerns about inflation were cited by 55.3 per cent of respondents (previously 63.6 per cent), and 52.3 per cent (previously 62.2 per cent) about the climate crisis. Fear of Corona, on the other hand, hardly plays a role anymore. Only 5.1 per cent still feel quite or very threatened by the pandemic (previously 12.1 per cent). This means that the population's crisis awareness has only increased in the case of migration. In all the other areas surveyed, it fell."
"Just when you thought the New York Times couldn’t have sunk any lower, everyone’s favorite transphobic neoliberal rag is back at it again with a preposterous premise: coddling racists with euphemisms. In an article called “The 6 Kinds of Republican Voters,” NYT breaks down Republican party allegiances with one of the strangest metrics ever devised. They use the following categories to distinguish so-called diversity among the platform: Anti-establishment, isolationist foreign policy, populist economics, racial conservatism, social conservatism, and Trump loyalty. As we’ve said before, what do you expect from a publication that defended J.K Rowling? If you’re wondering what the big difference is between categories like “racial conservatism” and “social conservatism,” don’t worry, we can’t figure that one out, either. The NYT is making the case that the Republican party is a lot more fractured than people think, and that not all Republicans hate things like … abortion or immigration, for example."

According to Fox , Capitol Police say they are “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are making plans to “ facilitate ” “ First Amendment protest activity ” — while also working with law enforcement agencies and the D.C. National Guard to prepare for Biden ’ s address . Law enforcement agencies across the National Capital Region are aware of plans for a series of truck convoys arriving in Washington , DC , around the time of the State of the Union . As with any demonstration , the USCP will facilitate lawful First Amendment activity . The USCP is closely coordinating with local , state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including DC ’ s Metropolitan Police Department , the United States Park Police , the United States Secret Service and other allied agencies to include the DC National Guard . Following the Capitol riot , House Democrats — particularly Pelosi — insisted the security fencing was a needed precaution , while Congressional Republicans accused Biden and the Democrats of attempting to create a barrier between the federal government and the American people . Interesting . Who ’ s lying ? Even if a convoy similar to that in Canada shows up in D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , braggadocious speech , do Capitol Police truly anticipate a riot similar to that on January 6 ? Based on what evidence ? Perhaps a belief that COVID restrictions protesters might be just as charged up — or more so — than were avid Trump supporters at the Capitol after the Electoral College vote went down ? I can ’ t answer the question .

But , Trump 's PAC reportedly awarded the prize to no one and he met with other big-money donors in the city instead . Though a PAC spokesperson said a winner was given an unspecified `` substitute prize , '' the incident has recalled other past times where Trump allegedly reneged on his promises . `` We 'll cover your flight .

'' However , Budowich did not specify what the substitution prize was , nor did he provide the name of a winner . `` We protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility and intimidation tactics often used against supporters of President Trump , '' Budowich said . It 's unclear how much money the New Orleans contest pulled in from donors hoping to meet with Trump .

If the PAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organizing simply fell through , then that 's not a crime , the expert said . Regardless , Trump 's small-dollar donors are unlikely to sue him .

""""""" The following is a transcript of an interview with Dr. Scott Gottlieb that aired Sunday , May 15 , 2022 , on `` Face the Nation . '' MARGARET BRENNAN : And we turn now to Dr. Scott Gottlieb , former Trump FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member . Good morning to you , Doctor . MARGARET BRENNAN : I want to tap into your perspective as someone who ran the FDA . You just heard the administration 's view that this baby formula shortage is really the failure of one company here and that the FDA is n't necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant . I wonder how you respond to that . DR. GOTTLIEB : Well , these were persistent problems that appear to have been handled poorly , certainly by the company . FDA did n't exert all the oversight that they could have of that facility . There were known problems with that facility going back many years or findings on previous inspections . The agency had a 34-page whistleblower report in hand , making pretty serious allegations that there was data falsifications and data falsification information withheld from inspectors . So these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think now that that facility has been shut by Abbott and production is n't going on . It 's going to be hard to clear the facility . The overhang of allegations of data falsification are going to be the kinds of allegations that are hard for the agency to clear . Even if they 're not able to prove a causal relationship between the infections that we saw in children and the facility itself which- with which so far the agency has n't been able to prove , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARGARET BRENNAN : Mm hmm . You just said that the FDA did n't do all it could . We know they did n't inspect the Abbott facility back in 2020 . They stopped inspecting some places during the pandemic that were n't mission critical . Is n't baby formula mission critical ? How does the facility not get inspected by the FDA ? DR. GOTTLIEB : Well , look , it is mission critical , and during the government shutdown , we actually preserved inspections of infant formula plants because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARGARET BRENNAN : When you were in office . DR. GOTTLIEB : -- probably should have been inspected , especially – when I was in office – especially given the fact that there had been prior findings there . The fact that FDA went into that facility this year and found five different strains of Cronobacter , that is a serious concern . It does n't appear to have been a state of the art facility based on the findings in that 483 . So they should have been under close supervision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the worst of both possible worlds right now . We have a regulatory scheme that stringent enough that does create obstacles to getting into the market for new entrants . There 's only been one new entrant in the last 15 years that 's a domestically based manufacturer , company by heart . But at the same time , it does n't provide stringent enough oversight of the resulting oligopoly . Three companies control 80 % of the market to ensure that there 's no snafus that can cause shut down those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a shutdown , when the market 's that concentrated , it creates these distributed shortages that we 're seeing right now that are very hard to resolve . They 're going to eventually need to get that facility reopened . The timeline for that is very unclear right now . MARGARET BRENNAN : And that 's what I wanted to ask you . I 'm sure the FDA commissioner will be questioned about that on Capitol Hill this week . But you said it 's a broken market and you 're pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they failed to maintain proper records and released untested baby formula . There 's all sorts of allegations in here . Does this sound like criminal behavior to you ? GOTTLIEB : Potentially . And that whistleblower report was sent to the head of the Office of Criminal Investigations at FDA . So it does appear to be a sophisticated whistleblower . Remember , this division at FDA is nine people and it was even fewer people when I was there . It 's grown in recent years and we made some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that group . So the entire industry in this country is overseen by nine people . This has been an under-resourced part of the agency for a very long time , and that 's contributing , I think , to these challenges that the agency is facing , trying to exert more vigorous and more efficient oversight . Yeah , those allegations are going to be very hard to clear . And another issue may be that the people who the whistleblower has implicated in FDA has interviewed that whistleblower may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency about the safety of that facility . And if that 's the case , that 's going to complicate issues . MARGARET BRENNAN : We have more to talk about with you as always . So stay with us . And on the other side of the break , we 'll continue the conversation . So stay with us on Face the Nation . MARGARET BRENNAN : Welcome back to Face the Nation . We want to continue now with former FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member Dr. Scott Gottlieb . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby formula shortage . I want to ask you about COVID , but just to pick up on something you said , I think you told me there are only nine people who oversee the entire baby formula industry in this country . Nine ? GOTTLIEB : That 's right . And I think I think there were , I believe , there were three when I started at the FDA . We got some more resources for that group . There 's been more resources added since then , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration to add four more people . But yeah , only nine people right now oversee , oversee the entire industry in the United States . And it was less than that just several years ago . MARGARET BRENNAN : That 's astounding . Let me ask you about COVID . We had this horrendous milestone this week of 1 million deaths over the entire course of this pandemic . Right now , we 're averaging about 326 deaths a week . So we 've come a far way . But we heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week that they have started putting on masks when they go indoors . Once again , there 's concern about an uptick . What do you see in terms of trend lines ? Where are we ? GOTTLIEB : Well , look , we 're definitely seeing a surge of infection , particularly in the Northeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic right now . If you look at the modeling going on in those states , states like Connecticut , New York , it does appear that the infections are peaking right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of infection driven by B.2 and this new Omicron variant B.2.12.1 that appears to be more contagious and have more immune escape than prior variants of Omicron . It looks like most of the people who are getting infected are n't people who are previously infected with B 1 . But some portion of the 40 % of people who escaped the prior wave of Omicron and are now getting caught by this current wave . I do believe that cases will continue to come down . Wastewater data collected by cities does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should n't have a big wave of infection this summer . Although there are models floating around the administration , it does show a big wave of infection this summer . The bottom line is , we did n't see that in 2020 . We did n't see it in 2021 when B117 emerged in the spring . So this summer should be a backstop against continued spread of this variant , but it does pose a risk for the fall . And it 's going to be important to learn whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now in development will cover this B2 variant well . Hopefully they will . I believe they will , but that remains to be seen . MARGARET BRENNAN : So you reject the idea of a summer surge , even though scientists like Dr. Birx , who was on this program just a few weeks ago , is predicting and seeing a trend line that makes her very concerned that could happen because it 's happened before . GOTTLIEB : Yeah . And there is a model that the White House was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big surge of infection in the summer driven by B2 as it moves into the Midwest and the West . I mean , it is certainly possible , but other people disagree with that model . There is the potential that you see a slow burn through the summer . I think it 's more likely that you 're going to see infection levels come down . Remember , we thought that there was going to be a big surge last year and this summer with B117 when it emerged in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later spring , infection levels came down . We had a relatively quiet June in July , and then Delta came along in late August and started to create a new wave of infection . I think that 's probably the pattern we 're going to see again , where June , July , relatively low people do feel safe again . And then as we head into the late summer , probably B.2.12.1 is going to emerge or B2 mostly in the south . MARGARET BRENNAN : Dr. Gottlieb , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your insight , as always . """""""

"The deepening of the divide between and within the US’s principal political parties foreshadows a deeply fractured presidential election According to former US Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, the United States (US) confronts perhaps its gravest threat to security in our times. He has alluded to the alliance between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea “whose collective nuclear arsenal could within a few years be nearly double the size of its own.” Unfortunately, he laments, instead of a coherent response from the US, we are getting one that is fractured by the deep divide between its principal political parties, the Democrats and the Republicans. But what happened this week—the removal of the Speaker of the House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy by his own partymen—suggests that the Republican Party in the Congress has itself become deeply polarised and difficult to manage. Just how deep this divide is became apparent in the refusal of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to pass their own bill to temporarily fund the government. A shutdown was narrowly averted but the issues that brought things to this pass have not gone away. The shutdown would have been the fourth in a decade and, if prolonged, would have caused suffering to millions of low-income people who get food assistance and would have forced federal employees, including the military, to go without pay.

"Jeff Landry, the hard-line conservative leading the race for governor of Louisiana, surveyed the crowd packed into a small restaurant in Monroe, where his staff had covered the tables and a lone Halloween skeleton in his blue-and-yellow campaign merchandise. “How would y’all like to finish this in October?” Mr. Landry, the state attorney general, said, teasing the possibility of his winning the state’s all-party primary outright this Saturday and foreclosing the need for a runoff election next month. He did not offer specifics about any issues. He did not mention any of his opponents, whom he has largely refused to debate. But his undisputed status as the race’s front-runner has suggested that for much of Louisiana, there has been little need for him to do any of that."

Last spring, it renamed a school christened after a Black historical figure from the state. Now, the Hanover County School Board is swept up in the widespread right-wing movement to reshape public education — and a bipartisan group of parents is fighting back. I recently visited a beer-and-music festival where members of Hanover Citizens for an Elected School Board were campaigning for their cause: taking away county officials’ power to appoint school board members, who are otherwise insulated from public accountability. Unelected boards are rooted in the state’s Jim Crow past, as they were sometimes used to keep Black residents out."

""""""" Long COVID-19 has had an air of mystery around it for months . Doctors have struggled to explain or understand why some people who contract COVID-19 end up having lingering symptoms like fatigue , difficulty thinking clearly , or shortness of breath weeks or even months later . A new study published in the journal Cell helps shed some light on the condition , for the first time identifying four factors that can help predict whether someone will develop long COVID-19 . “ Being able to identify the factors that can cause the disease , cause the chronic condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it actually is a condition that can be treatable , ” Jim Heath , president of the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle , and an author of the study , said in an interview . “ And then some of these factors also are in fact the kind of things one can imagine developing treatments for. ” The most important factor the study identified in predicting long COVID-19 is the presence of certain kinds of antibodies called autoantibodies , which mistakenly attack healthy parts of the body . Autoantibodies are associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your immune system attacks your own body . But someone does not have to have an autoimmune disease to have autoantibodies present and be at higher risk for long COVID-19 , Heath said . “ Most people that have autoantibodies do n't really know it , ” he said . “ They 're what you call subclinical ... maybe you have a risk of some autoimmune disease but it has n't developed. ” Still , he said one practical application of the study is that lupus treatments could be “ worth exploring ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second factor that can lead to long COVID-19 is the reactivation of a different virus called Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ) , which is extremely common , infecting up to 90 percent of people at some point , and often causes only mild symptoms . The virus usually becomes inactive in the body following the initial infection , but it can be reactivated when someone gets COVID-19 , helping lead to long COVID-19 symptoms . Heath said EBV could become reactivated when the immune system is distracted by fighting COVID-19 . “ It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s COVID-19 infection is taking that attention away , ” he said . The third factor identified is how much of the virus that causes COVID-19 , officially called SARS-Cov-2 , is present in the blood , known as the “ viral load. ” This factor along with the role of EBV suggests that new antiviral drugs that fight the immediate effects of COVID-19 infection , like the Pfizer pill Paxlovid , might also be useful in treating long COVID-19 . “ Two of these predictive factors are virus levels that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . “ So that suggests that these antivirals that are being used to treat acute disease probably have a role for long COVID as well. ” The final of the four factors that can predict long COVID-19 is more easily identifiable : if a patient has Type 2 diabetes . While these four factors are a step forward in understanding what causes long COVID-19 and helping develop treatments , the mechanism for why they are associated with long COVID-19 is still not fully clear . “ They have a flavor of mechanistic factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual mechanism is not clear. ” The study followed 309 COVID-19 patients , taking blood and swab samples at different points in time . In addition , one way to likely cut the risk of long COVID-19 is vaccination . A separate study from the United Kingdom found that vaccinated people were 41 percent less likely to develop long COVID-19 . """""""

Since the attack , Russia has closed its airspace to the EU , Canada , and the U.S . In response , the U.S. and some of its allies banned Russian flights from entering their airspace as well .

However , more than two hours of flight time will be added in each direction , which Gupta called `` a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers also use Russian airspace to fly to Asia and will have to look for alternative longer routes , or perhaps even consider 'tech stops ' to refuel , reduce passenger capacity or cargo on board , '' he said , according to Axios .

""""""" WASHINGTON ( AP ) — On restoring access to abortion , President Joe Biden says his hands are tied without more Democratic senators . Declaring a public health emergency on the matter has downsides , his aides say . And as for gun violence , Biden has been clear about the limits of what he can do on his own . “ There ’ s a Constitution , ” Biden said from the South Lawn in late May . “ I can ’ t dictate this stuff. ” Throughout this century , presidents have often pushed aggressively to extend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about its limits . When it comes to the thorniest issues confronting his administration , the instinct from Biden and his White House is often to speak about what he can not do , citing constraints imposed by the courts or insufficient support in a Congress controlled by his own party — though barely . He injects a heavy dose of reality in speaking to an increasingly restive Democratic base , which has demanded action on issues such as abortion and voting rights before the November elections . White House officials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typifies a leader who has always promised to be honest with Americans , including about how expansive his powers really are . But Biden 's realpolitik tendencies are colliding with an activist base agitating for a more aggressive party leader — both in tone and substance . Although candidate Biden sold himself as the person who best knew the ways of Washington , he nonetheless is hamstrung by the same obstacles that have bedeviled his predecessors . “ I think that if you hesitate from important actions like this just because of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , ” said Rep. Judy Chu , D-Calif. , who has been pressing for more administrative actions on abortion . “ People all across the country are expecting us — the leaders — to do something. ” Biden ’ s cautionary approach could be to protect himself if the White House falls short — like Democrats did in negotiating a party-line spending package centered on the social safety net and climate provisions . That sweeping effort had been steadily thwarted due to resistance from two moderate Democrats , one of them West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday scuttled for the time being a scaled-back effort that focused on climate and taxes . That development prompted calls from Democratic senators for Biden to unilaterally declare a climate emergency . In a statement Friday while in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , Biden pledged to take “ strong executive action to meet this moment ” on climate . But in recent weeks , that gap between “ yes , we can ” and “ no , we can ’ t ” has been most glaring on abortion . Since the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wade ruling from 1973 with its constitutional protections for abortion , the White House has come under considerable pressure to try to maintain access to abortion in conservative states that are set to outlaw the procedure . For instance , advocates have implored Biden to look into establishing abortion clinics on federal lands . They have asked the administration to help transport women seeking abortions to a state that offers the procedure . And Democratic lawmakers are pressing the White House to declare a public health emergency . Without rejecting the ideas completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about such requests . And even as he signed an executive order last week to begin addressing the issue , Biden had one clear , consistent message : that he could not do this on his own , shifting attention to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue . “ The only way we can secure a woman ’ s right to choose and the balance that existed is for Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as federal law , ” Biden said shortly after the court struck down Roe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do that. ” Shortly after declaring that the filibuster — a Senate rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation to advance — should not apply for abortion and privacy measures , Biden acknowledged during a meeting with Democratic governors that his newfound position would not make a difference , at least not right away . “ The filibuster should not stand in the way of us being able to do that , ” Biden said of writing the protections of Roe into federal law . “ But right now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate to change the filibuster . '' Biden , who served for 36 years in the Senate , is an institutionalist to his core and has tried to operate under the constraints of those institutions — unlike his predecessor , Donald Trump , who repeatedly pushed the boundaries of executive power . But some advocates do n't want to hear from Biden about what he can ’ t do . Renee Bracey Sherman , founder and executive director of the group We Testify , which advocates for women who have had abortions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public health emergency even if it 's eventually blocked by the courts . “ It tells those people who need abortions that the president is trying to help them , and that the thing that ’ s stopping him is the court , not himself , or his own projections on what could possibly happen , ” she said , later adding : “ The fact that he ’ s an institutionalist and can not look around and see the institutions around him are crumbling is the problem. ” Democratic lawmakers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the scenes . In a virtual meeting this past week , Chu urged Xavier Becerra , the health and human services secretary , to have the administration enact a public health emergency . Proponents of the idea say it would unlock certain powers and resources to not only expand access to abortion but to protect doctors who provide them . Though Becerra did not rule out the idea , he told Chu and other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus that the administration had two main questions : How would the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund and what would this move actually accomplish ? The skepticism has not deterred Democratic lawmakers . But some of the most ardent proponents of expansive executive actions on abortion have similarly cautioned their voters and activists to be realistic . “ It ’ s unrealistic to think that they have the power and the authority to protect access to abortion services in every part of this country because of what the Supreme Court has done , '' said Sen. Tina Smith , D-Minn . In one sense , the recent success on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s art-of-the-possible approach , advocates say . Rather than promising what he could not achieve , Biden instead spoke of his limitations and cautioned that any substantive changes would require the support of at least 10 Senate Republicans — a goal that seemed implausible at the start . That culminated this past week with a ceremony marking the signing of the first substantial gun restrictions into law in roughly three decades . “ I think that the president has struck the absolute right balance , ” said John Feinblatt , the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the limitations on Biden ’ s executive powers aren ’ t mere hypotheticals . His administration ’ s efforts to tame the coronavirus pandemic , for example , were repeatedly foiled by the courts , including a requirement to wear masks on mass transit and a vaccination mandate for companies with at least 100 workers . Then-President Barack Obama sounded similar warnings when confronted by immigration activists urging him to use his power to issue a deportation reprieve for millions of young immigrants who did not have legal status in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which is still standing today . Two years later , Obama more fully embraced the pen-and-phone strategy , signaling to Congress that he would not hesitate to use executive orders if lawmakers continued to imperil his domestic agenda . “ Nobody thinks he ’ s got a magic wand here . Folks understand there are limitations , ” said Leah Greenberg , co-founder and co-executive director of the Indivisible Project . “ What they want to see is him treating this like the crisis it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion . ” """""""

The reef is one of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the third-largest barrier reef in the world and stretches more than 350 miles off the Florida coast from the city of Stuart to Dry Tortugas National Park . It 's a diverse ecosystem , a tourist attraction and it helps protect the coast from storm surges , providing billions of dollars in economic benefit . Over the last half-century , the reefs have lost 95 % of the coral that once covered them because of development , human activity and climate change .

Hundreds of corals from 18 different species were collected in the Florida Keys and brought here , to the Florida Coral Rescue Center , for safekeeping . With near-perfect conditions , the corals have thrived and begun to reproduce . Most corals spawn at night several days after a `` full moon '' mimicked by the lighting system . When that happens , Justin Zimmerman , a supervisor here , says his staff pulls all-nighters , watching the corals . `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they float to the top , '' he says . `` We can collect those , let them fertilize and then will settle the baby corals , the larvae after they develop , on little tiles . '' The baby corals increase the genetic diversity of species that are facing myriad threats to their long-term survival . That 's why three years ago , SeaWorld , in partnership with Disney and the Fish and Wildlife Foundation of Florida , opened this facility . The most recent threat to the reef has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy Bruckner , a researcher with the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary . `` That probably killed more coral in Florida than any other single event has , '' he says . `` It affects these big boulder corals that grow much more slowly and that are more important in terms of building the framework — the structure — these other corals live on . '' There is some hope now that the disease has peaked and may subside . But the damage it 's done is substantial , adding to the devastation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reefs now largely gray and lifeless . Scientists and divers agree — Florida 's coral reefs have declined dramatically since the 1960s and '70s . Bruckner says there 's no single smoking gun responsible for the devastation . There are local stresses , like damage done to reefs by boat anchors or irresponsible divers and fishermen . There are regional issues , including poor water quality and overfishing . `` And the global stressor , '' he says , referring to climate change . `` That 's probably the No . 1 factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , and ultimately could be responsible for their demise if we do n't take steps to address it . The warming oceans cause thermal stress , leading to bleaching events and making corals more susceptible to disease .

The sharp decline of Florida 's barrier reef and the growing threats to its long-term survival have mobilized a broad coalition of activists , scientists and government officials . `` These are the only reefs like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , '' says Sarah Fangman , the superintendent of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary , which includes nearly all of Florida 's reefs . `` We do n't have a spare Florida reef system .

Since 2007 , a group based in the Florida Keys , the Coral Restoration Foundation , has been working to show it 's possible to restore declining reefs and bring them back to vitality .

"BUENOS AIRES, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The hand-written entries in the two dozen notebooks - date, haircut, price - chronicle decades of a Buenos Aires barber's working life.

In his small barbershop with sandy wooden floorboards and a fishbowl glass window to the street outside, Ruben Galante has for some four decades watched presidents come and go, myriad economic crises, and fast-rising prices.

"Once rock-solid, the support that Ukraine has gotten from its biggest backers for its fight against Russia is showing cracks. Political posturing in places like Poland and Slovakia, where a trade dispute with Ukraine has stirred tensions, and Republican reticence in the United States about Washington’s big spending to prop up Ukraine’s military have raised new uncertainties about the West’s commitment to its efforts to expel Russian invaders more than 18 months into the war. And Russian President Vladimir Putin, who hopes to outlast allied backing for Kyiv, will be ready to capitalize if he sees Ukraine is running low on air defence or other weapons."

""""""" This is the latest in our series on underrated destinations , It 's Still a Big World . A silver lining to Staten Island ’ s comparative remoteness is that things that would almost certainly have been demolished decades or centuries ago in another borough are still there . Conference House , from around 1680 , the Alice Austen House , whose oldest portions are from 1690 , the Voorlezer House in Historic Richmond Town from not much later , and all sorts of other things . And the biggest survivor , the entirely undersung Sailors ’ Snug Harbor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you ’ re hardly alone–but you can fix that now . Sailors ’ Snug Harbor contains a row of imitation Greek temples , the second-oldest theater in New York City , a walled Chinese garden originally constructed in Suzhou , a maritime museum wherein a flotilla of model ships are anchored , paintings by Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Jasper Cropsey , stained glass by John La Farge , a sculpture by Augustus Saint- Gaudens , a working farm , and much more . Its fans include Jacqueline Onassis and Whit Stillman , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distress there and attested in conversation , “ I love Sailors ’ Snug Harbor—pretty much everything about it from its history , creation and purpose to the extraordinary assembly of beautiful buildings. ” It ’ s all housed on the grounds of a former home for retired mariners amidst 84 largely green acres . It ’ s not really even hard to get to , save by New York City standards of extreme ease ; 10 minutes by bus or Uber from the ferry terminal–or you can walk there in about 40 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine Victorian and especially Shingle-style homes in New Brighton en route . It ’ s a much better cause to go to sea than the Empire Outlets . The feel of the campus is impressive and slightly surreal . The architectural critic Paul Goldberger described it this way in the New York Times : “ Snug Harbor has something of the feel of a campus , something of the feel of a small-town square . Indeed , these rows of classical temples , set side-by-side with tiny connecting structures recessed behind the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit into no pattern we recognize - they are lined up as if on a street , yet they are set in the landscape of a park . They seem at once to embrace the 19th-century tradition of picturesque design and , by virtue of their rigid linear order , to reject it. ” There ’ s an aura a little reminiscent of Governors Island , a place out of time , whose past isn ’ t initially easy to puzzle out . Snug Harbor is a bit farther along the tenanting path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s more to do , and these tenants are a bit less aggressively bourgeois , so they ’ re less irritating . In other words , go . How did all of this get here ? Captain Robert Richard Randall , a prosperous mariner , willed the bulk of his wealth upon his death in 1801 to establishing a home for maintaining “ aged , decrepit , and worn-out sailors. ” Alexander Hamilton is believed to have written Randall ’ s will . Legal troubles ( disputatious offspring , as usual ) tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that sort of delay is actively fortuitous when you own 24 acres of land in Greenwich Village . The goldmine of these real estate holdings enabled a shift of plan , to the purchase of 160 acres in Staten Island , where the institution opened in 1833 . The most consequential buildings were designed by Minard Lafever , ( architect of numerous historic churches throughout New York ) in Greek Revival style . Greek Revival styles were a go-to in the early U.S. for readymade associations of Athenian democracy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Argonauts . There ’ s a very fine Italianate chapel designed by James Solomon , a Music Hall ( the second-oldest in town after Carnegie Hall ) and plenty else . Its landmarking designation reads , “ A rare surviving example of urban planning , landscaping and buildings in the Greek Revival style , Sailors ' Snug has no equal in scale , extent or quality in America. ” Snug Harbor swelled to considerable size over time . It contained 55 buildings and over 1,000 sailors at its 1880 peak . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some were shocking . It featured a positively indulgent replica of St. Paul ’ s Cathedral in London ( a lofty pulpit for a Reverend Mapples ) , complete with variegated marbles from Etruria , Siena , and Numidia–unfortunately lost to fire . The Snug Harbor scheme was quite generous by the very low standards of 19th century retirement assistance : sailors were required to have five years of naval service for the US , or 10 for another country . There were no creedal or racial restrictions . Captain Thomas Melville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was governor of the campus from 1867 to 1884 . Herman visited repeatedly . The journalist and novelist Theodore Dreiser lived nearby for a time in Staten Island and wrote a piece on the institution for Ainslee ’ s Magazine in 1898 , “ When The Sails Are Furled : Sailor 's Snug Harbor . '' He praised the place , writing , “ The grounds are so ample and the buildings so large that the attention of every one is instantly taken. ” He also wrote , “ I doubt if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found. ” The main note of fun and melancholy in Dreiser ’ s article is the elderly mariners themselves . “ Though the surroundings are pastoral , the appearance of the inmates of this retreat , as well as their conversation , is of the sea , salty . Housed though they are for the remainder of their days on land , they are still sailors , vain of their service upon the great waters of the world and but littler tolerant of landlubbers in general . Dreiser reports the “ pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ So old and crotchety , most of them are. ” Snug Harbor was theoretically dry but , “ Not a few of them are given to sweating loudly , drinking frequently , snoring heavily on Sundays , and otherwise disporting themselves in droll and unsanctified ways. ” The number of residents dwindled over time , down to about 100 by the 1970s . Several buildings were demolished . The remaining sailors were relocated to a new facility in North Carolina . The city acquired the land in 1975 and Jaqueline Onassis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of the complex . “ The more attention that can be attracted to this lovely place the better , ” she said on a 1976 visit , quoted in the New York Times . Six of the buildings ( and the interior of three ) were among the first in New York City to be landmarked by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in the 1970s . Cultural institutions began to open in 1976 , and you now have a full fleet of them to draw upon . The Staten Island Museum has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenants , and amidst the at-times exhaustive specialization of New York museums it ’ s refreshing to encounter a museum in which there ’ s a little bit of everything within a compact space . The Mastodon is just a few steps from the cicada collection , the Florentine Majolica just a few cases from the pipe stem from Burkina Faso . The museum contains , as wall text explains , “ one of the world ’ s largest collections of cicadas ” , the work of one of the museum ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure prominently in a surprisingly engrossing current exhibit , “ Magicicada ” , by Jennifer Angus , which arranges cicadas in fanciful apothecary drawer displays ( reading books and doing much else ) , jars , and a range of other settings . The art is eclectic but strong . There are Qing dynasty ceramics , Greek and Roman antiquities , but also a Raphael Soyer painting . A Nymphaeum–Baths of the Villa Aldobrandini at Rome Opus Civ by Lawrence Alma-Tadema , a taste of his exhaustive catalog of Roman decadence , awaits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art features some local plodders but a number of great pieces . Jasper Cropsey brings the Hudson River School treatment to the island in Looking Oceanward from Todt Hill , from days when there weren ’ t many home to impede the view . Elysian early vistas of the island remain always a shock ( another from fellow Hudson River school artist Herman Feuchsel stands out ) but there are several excellent pieces from the 20th century . Outsider artist Victor Joseph Gatto , a boxer in early life , shines with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party at South Beach . Anthny Toney ’ s Klee-spirited Afternoon on a Hill abstracts away much more urbanized 1950s island hills to great effect . The collection isn ’ t all antiquity : A painting by Bosnian immigrant Amer Kobasliga depicting Hurricane Sandy damage on the island offers ample evidence that the local talent well remains full . The Noble Maritime Collection holds all sorts of maritime art , with highlights by Swedish-American Gustav Romin ’ and marine artist Edward Moran . A transom window by American glassmaking master John LaFarge hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ’ ve seen many houseboat studios elsewhere in New York museums lately . There ’ s one here . John N. Noble was born in Paris , son of an artist , and raised in highbrow circuits , but worked on schooners and in marine salvage and found his Arles in the unlikely spot of the Port Johnston coal docks across the channel in Bayonne . He built a floating studio from salvaged parts and painted there for decades beginning in 1946 . This artful wreck is now in permanent dry dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was once a sailors ’ dormitory , features one room arranged as a bedroom would have been . There ’ s an exhibit on Kate Walker , the keeper of the Robbins Reef lighthouse north of Staten Island from 1890 to 1919 , who took over the position after her husband died and rescued some 50 mariners from drowning over this span . The museum contains ship models of antique and recent make , depicting all sorts of ages of sail and steam , from the Bonhomme Richard to HMS Victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French navy . Tools of the trade also abound , from stadimeters ( for measuring the distance between ships , news to me ) to sextants to octants and onwards . A former writing room is topped with a trompe l ’ oeil ceiling mural of a glasshouse roof with hints of the South Seas . A maritime library offers a wide-ranging selection of nautical books , from Jules Verne to Jane ’ s Guides to ocean liner histories ; all of the armchairs and desks were empty upon my visit . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lively from the exterior . The Music Hall is currently being renovated and expanded but held an assortment of concerts in the past , and will host more . The Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art is currently closed but past exhibitions and the structure seem a strong attraction , with a large dome and painted nautical ornaments by Charles Berry inside . Other arts organizations hold classes in a variety of buildings . Just walking around the remainder is well worth it ; a row of Second Empire cottages by Richard P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a replica of a Saint-Gaudens statue of Captain Randall ( the original is in the Newhouse building ) , and a recast J.W . Fiske statue of Neptune . More contemporary sculptures are dappled around . Gardens are a prime attraction , none more so than the superlatively placid Chinese Scholars Garden . The garden was originally built in Suzhou and then disassembled and shipped to Snug Harbor , where a team of 40 Chinese artisans reassembled it , to open in 1999 . The main structure is walled , but includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of banana leaves , gourds , or keyholes . There are bat-shaped door pulls . The structure was built without nails or glue using traditional Ming dynasty methods , and frames ponds and waterfalls , and sculptural rock arrangements . Flowering plum , saucer magnolia , peach , and eastern white pine trees , and winter jasmine and bamboo plants can be found throughout . There is a “ knowing fish pavilion ” ( I don ’ t know ) and “ the garden of poetic pleasures ” ( absolutely ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , English-styled white gardens inspired by Vita Sackville-West ’ s monochromatic Sissinghurst gardens , a rose garden , a Hornbeam allee , and a castle-walled secret garden , inspired by you know what , closed on my visit but looking great in photos . Wetlands , trails , a sailors ’ cemetery , and a working farm all can be found elsewhere on the complex . The campus makes occasional screen appearances , on Law and Order SVU , Gotham , and Madam Secretary . Its top billing occurred in Whit Stillman ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it stood in for a fictional Seven Oaks College . The director of Metropolitan , Last Days of Disco , and Love and Friendship was seeking the right setting . Snug Harbor rapidly impressed , he explains in an interview . “ It ’ s my favorite architecture . It ’ s one of the greatest collections of Greek Revival architecture in America . It ’ s like a row of temples … I used as much of it as I could . It ’ s like certain people when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the neck and everything. ” The production used a number of buildings that aren ’ t open to the public ( you can find on screen ) . He recalled a “ stupid story ” alleging his disappearance from a day of production ; he was actually peering around additional interiors on the campus . They couldn ’ t use the music hall but he declared it , “ absolutely terrific. ” The location is unusual in that it sits across from a highly industrial stretch of New Jersey visible across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that angle . “ If you look the other way you can see these enormous ships . It was fun doing that cheat because we made it look like a tranquil quadrangle but it ’ s actually opposite this busy shipping channel. ” The containerized present and the sails of the past are all visible at Snug Harbor , and you don ’ t need to retire to drop in . I ’ m not going to be so foolish as to declare this the most unusual cultural complex in the city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly a surprise from about any vantage , and about the easiest “ day trip ” you could mount .

The storm has just ripped through the state of a governor who has shown disdain for federal funding. Still, the Biden administration did not hesitate to grant an emergency declaration and has committed billions of dollars in recovery funds to the state. Does Gov.

Or will he take the money and show that his previous pronouncements were largely posturing?"

"Last week, at the American Enterprise Institute, former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and I sat down to talk about the future of school reform with The New York Times’ Erica Green (you can see the video here). Across town, at exactly the same time, Rep. Matt Gaetz and his gang of very online arsonists were toppling the House Speaker out of pique. Against that backdrop, our conversation felt civilized, even convivial. That’s funny both because so much educational debate of late has felt far from that and because, as longtime readers may recall, I had a fairly contentious relationship with Arne and his team during Obama-era fights over stuff like Race to the Top, teacher evaluation, Title IX guidance, and the Common Core. Well, last week, we covered a lot of ground: Testing. Parents. “Book bans.” Leadership. Chronic absenteeism. And more. I don’t want to rehash the whole thing here (watch it if you’re curious or read a summary here). But as I reflected on the conversation and heard reactions to it, there are five thoughts I thought were worth sharing."

"CNN — President Joe Biden and his Oval Office predecessor, Donald Trump, are about to wage the most direct showdown yet of their possible rematch as far-right House Republicans drive the nation to the brink of a government shutdown. Intense activity from Washington to swing-state Michigan during this pivotal week will recall how extremism rocked political institutions during the ex-president’s turbulent term and will test Biden’s capacity to again exploit the chaos to empower his reelection bid."
"Our first branch of government in the United States has been paralyzed and thrown into chaos — again — by a small cadre of far-right MAGA members of the House Freedom Caucus. It’s not by fluke or flaw, but rather the disciplined execution of a plan. And both the Democrats and Republicans had better wake up to the new reality if they want to preserve a government capable of responding to international crises and the needs of the American people. The writing was on the wall less than a week after the November 2022 elections gave Republicans a razor-thin majority in the House. On Nov. 14, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) convened a forum on House Rules with leaders of the Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI) that laid out the Freedom Caucus plan for wielding unprecedented power over Congress. “In light of the narrow majority, activist members of the House Freedom Caucus should recognize and embrace what we have today, which is de facto European-style coalition government,” noted lead panelist and CPI President and CEO Ed Corrigan. “In a sense, we have three political parties in the House: the Democrats, the Republicans, and the Freedom Caucus. More than [at] any time in history, the HFC has extraordinary power to negotiate a leadership arrangement that empowers all members, especially conservatives.”"

"Pity the Bud Light marketing staffers who hired Dylan Mulvaney. This spring, the brand sent the transgender influencer a can of beer with her face on it for a jokey 60-second Instagram video promoting a March Madness giveaway. Cue the culture-war panic: a strikingly effective right-wing boycott, followed by anger at the brand’s response from the LGBTQ community. Nearly $400 million in sales—and Bud Light’s 22-year supremacy as the bestselling U.S. beer—vanished in weeks. It was one of the more public, and painful, recent implosions of socially conscious branding, but it’s far from the only one. Just in recent months, the Bud Light boycott has shared headlines with similar customer backlash against Target and Kohl’s for selling LGBTQ Pride-related merchandise; ongoing skirmishes between Disney and Gov.

"In Pennsylvania, Democrats have passed bills in the state House to raise the minimum wage and enshrine the right to collective bargaining in the state constitution. They were able to do so in part because DSA and the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO joined forces to elect legislators like Representative Elizabeth Fiedler; unions, teachers, and pro-choice groups also came together to back Representative Lindsay Powell. What Maurice Mitchell, national director of the WFP, called “the broader movement left” and labor also united to elect Brandon Johnson mayor of Chicago and send Greg Casar of Texas to Congress in 2022. Alexa Avilés, a New York City councilmember in Brooklyn, won her 2021 race with strong support from unions, the WFP, and DSA—thanks, she said, to a shared focus on prioritizing the needs of “people over profit.” The language left-leaning groups use today—people over profits, workers over bosses, ordinary or working people over elites—has clear antecedents in left-wing movements like Occupy and political campaigns like Bernie Sanders’s presidential runs. Now a number of prominent labor leaders have adopted this language as well, signaling a return to labor’s radical roots. The UAW’s Shawn Fain has described the autoworkers’ strike as a struggle between the “billionaire class” and the “working class”; Stacy Davis Gates, who heads the Chicago Teachers Union, or CTU, recently vowed to prioritize “the voices of the many” by fighting “tooth and nail” to ensure that supporters of school choice and privatization do not infect Chicago’s board of education with “fascism and racism”; and Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO, spoke in 2021 about the transformative power of having the legal standing, via a union, to “make capital have to respond to working people.” Thanks to the renewed vigor of each, the left and labor are now on the cusp of forging a more durable alliance. Olivia Killingsworth, a DSA organizer and SAG-AFTRA member, said it’s been heartening to see how coordinated and supportive of each other’s campaigns New York City unions have been, “from the bottom to the top.” More tempered in his read of the landscape was Jesse Sharkey, former president of the CTU. He acknowledged some “bright spots” but said that overall, he doesn’t see “the kind of risk taking and confrontation with capital that we’re going to need in order to win.” Meanwhile, Wuchinich believes that labor’s biggest opportunity to build power lies in bringing more people into the movement. “We build real power when people make the decision to stand up and fight their bosses,” she said, and when they “expect more from themselves than the rest of the world has been expecting from them.”"

""""""" After migrants arrived by bus at Vice President Kamala Harris ’ s home in Washington , DC , on Christmas Eve , they weren ’ t left in the freezing cold without winter jackets for long .

Mutual aid groups , which have been receiving migrants in DC , got a tip from their partner organizations on the border that three buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the buses arrived a day earlier than expected , and that sent groups including the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network rushing to ensure that the city could transport them to a church and synagogue where they provided hot food , clothes , and toys for the children .

As of November , Texas had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the country under the program without giving notice to local officials or mutual aid groups in the receiving cities , apparently with the aim of sowing chaos and blaming it on President Joe Biden . Arizona Gov . Doug Ducey and Florida Gov . Ron DeSantis , both Republicans , have since adopted similar programs in their states . Abbott has been clear that he ’ s sent waves of migrants north to force President Biden to do more to secure the border . But mutual aid groups see an unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Democrat-led states : As long as the trips are voluntary , they can bring migrants closer to their final destinations in the US . Aid groups are working around the clock to make the process smoother by greeting migrants upon their arrival in receiving cities , helping them get to their final destination , and offering them ongoing support and help with the typically lengthy process of applying for legal status in the US . But the groups say they aren ’ t getting enough help from local governments , whose resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government hasn ’ t stepped in to formalize the process nationally . In June , the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) awarded a $ 2 million grant to the humanitarian aid organization SAMU First Response to operate a temporary shelter for migrants arriving by bus in Montgomery County , Maryland , which is just outside DC . But mutual aid groups have been calling on the Biden administration to increase its financial support . In DC , existing city resources aren ’ t sufficient , Bahl said . DC Mayor Muriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public emergency that freed up $ 10 million in funds to establish an Office of Migrant Services that provides migrants with food , health care , and , in the case of families with young children , temporary accommodation in hotels . The city has also allowed migrant children to enroll in public schools . But individuals who aren ’ t traveling with young children don ’ t get city-sponsored housing and they ’ re also not currently allowed to access city homeless services even if they can prove residency , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them accommodation in hotels , religious institutions , or in volunteers ’ homes . Recognizing the gap in services , Bowser has twice requested that the National Guard be dispatched to help receive migrants arriving by bus , but the Pentagon refused her both times , and mutual aid groups have argued that the military shouldn ’ t get involved in what is a humanitarian matter . Similarly , New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams declared a state of emergency over the migrant crisis in October , when there was an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city every day , putting pressure on the city ’ s coffers . Mutual aid groups say that the creation of a uniform system under which blue cities can process new arrivals from the border could help . Under the current system , “ every receiving city is reinventing the wheel to some degree , ” Bahl said . These groups currently rely on their partners at NGOs on the border for information about how many migrants are on their way and when they ’ re projected to arrive . There ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government officials in Texas , Arizona , and Florida who are chartering these buses and planes . That meant that residents of Martha ’ s Vineyard were caught unprepared when DeSantis flew migrants to the island earlier this year . Local residents rallied : The migrants were taken in by a church and provided with a cellphone if they didn ’ t already have one and a $ 50 Visa gift card . With their consent , Massachusetts Gov . Charlie Baker then temporarily housed them on a military base at Cape Cod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including food , health care , hygiene kits , and legal and crisis counsel . But the process can still be so much smoother , Bahl said . “ If the federal government sat down and formalized this process and then supported receiving cities , we could actually create something that is helpful for the entire country , ” she said . The Biden administration has called on Abbott to cooperate with states that are receiving migrants . Abdullah Hasan , a White House spokesman , said in a statement Monday that Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the road in below-freezing temperatures on Christmas Eve , ” but that he had also done so “ without coordinating with any federal or local authorities. ” It ’ s not clear whether the administration has the power to legally do much more than that , or whether that would require federal legislation — a prospect that is very unlikely in the closely divided Congress that will convene in the new year .

"On October 1, Robert Fico beat out three former prime ministers in Slovakia’s parliamentary elections, and on October 11, he agreed to a coalition that will form Slovakia’s next government (Euractiv, October 1; Euronews, October 11). Fico, a former Slovak prime minister himself, was expected to have minimal success from the earliest election surveys to the final exit polls. Many Slovaks viewed him as unelectable due to his contentious past. His far-left party, which traces its roots to the Communist regime, Direction – Social Democracy (SMER), appeared to have limited potential for coalition-building. Against all odds, SMER won a plurality of votes, and Fico has successfully built a governing collation that will make up the majority of the Slovak National Council. Barring an extraordinary turn of events, Fico will begin his third term as prime minister before the end of October 2023. Only five years ago, Fico was implicated in the assassination of journalist Ján Kuciak (Balkan Insight, August 5, 2020). The journalist and his fiancé were gunned down in their home after Kuciak uncovered that members of SMER were involved in tax fraud and embezzlement with the Italian mafia. Fico was forced to resign after weeks of intense protests. His political career appeared to be over. Fico’s re-election highlights the political turmoil that has plagued the Slovak political system in recent months. Slovakia’s recent political crisis began in December 2022, when then-Prime Minister Eduard Heger’s unstable four-party coalition fell apart, resulting in a vote of no confidence against the government. Much like the highly polarized Slovak society, the governing coalition was divided by each party’s views on Russia. Rising energy costs and inflation further inflamed the divisions in Slovakia’s foreign policy orientation. The government’s death knell ultimately sounded on the heels of a slew of ministerial resignations and reports that then-Minister of Agriculture Ján Mi?ovský’s privately owned company had received over €1.4 million ($1.47 million) in subsidies from Mi?ovský’s colleague at the Ministry of Environment (DW, December 15, 2022)."

""""""" Part of Pandemic-Proof , Future Perfect ’ s series on the upgrades we can make to prepare for the next pandemic . In 2010 , game designer and forecaster Jane McGonigal invited nearly 20,000 people to imagine a future pandemic — and , for a few weeks , live as though it were real . Specifically , McGonigal asked them to simulate a respiratory pandemic that originates in China in 2020 and travels around the world infecting millions of people . They practiced wearing masks in public . They wrote journal entries about how it feels to get quarantine orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ d use their unique skills to help others in this scenario . So when the real respiratory pandemic originated in China in 2020 , they felt ready . They emailed McGonigal things like , “ I ’ m not freaking out , I already worked through the panic and anxiety when we imagined it 10 years ago , ” and , “ Time to start social distancing ! ” Increased mental resilience and an ability to adapt faster are among the benefits of simulating the future , according to McGonigal ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how anybody can get better at forecasting the future and preparing for it . Crucially , you don ’ t need to be invited into a large-scale game like the one above , which was dubbed EVOKE . You can start by simply writing a journal entry as though you ’ re living through a future threat — whether it ’ s a new pandemic , a climate disaster , an incoming asteroid , or an emerging technology gone awry . Ask yourself questions like : What will I feel in this future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ? How will I use my unique strengths to help others ? Questions like these spark a “ learned helpfulness ” process that can make you feel empowered as you look ahead , says McGonigal , who directs games research at the Institute for the Future . I talked to her about how we can train ourselves to become better futurists , why making better forecasters out of the public can lead to better policy , and how simulations are processed in the brain . A transcript of our conversation , edited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before anyone ever heard of Covid-19 , you ran not one but two big pandemic simulations . In 2008 , you ran Superstruct , which simulated a respiratory pandemic . And in 2010 , you ran a simulation called EVOKE for the World Bank , which imagined a respiratory pandemic plus other disasters happening at the same time — extreme weather from climate change , misinformation , and so on . What did your simulations accurately predict ? In these simulations , we gave the same scenario to everyone : There ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being asked to quarantine , schools might be closed . And we asked questions like : Under what circumstances would you violate an order to quarantine ? The No . 1 thing we heard was for religious worship . People would go to church or synagogue even if it put them at risk . And of course we then saw that [ with the real Covid-19 pandemic ] early on , so much of the superspreading was happening around churches and religious services , and a lot of the conflict that arose around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gather for worship . We also had people practice wearing masks out in public . We asked : How long would you be willing to wear one for ? What would you want to take it off for ? And we definitely saw participants report the friction and the discomfort with it . So we knew [ at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic ] that things that were going to interfere with our social interactions were going to be tricky . We also saw moms worrying : What am I going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Am I going to be able to work ? And , of course , that turned out to be a serious economic issue — we saw a mass exodus of women from the workplace . You often get asked , “ What ’ s the secret to making accurate future forecasts like Superstruct and EVOKE ? ” In your book , you say that it ’ s no great secret — just pay attention to what experts are warning you about . Specifically , you mention “ signals of change ” and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you mean by those ? Future forces are large-scale drivers of change . They ’ re like the winds of change , the hurricanes of change — you see them coming from very far off . For example , we know that extreme heat is one of the big future forces that we ’ re going to be grappling with for the next few decades . Not all future forces are bad — some are good . Universal basic income is one that I ’ m really excited about . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are reports and publications that do a really good job of conveying this . Make it a habit every year to go read the World Economic Forum ’ s Global Risks Report that comes out in January . It ’ s 500 to 1,000 experts saying what keeps them up at night and how likely they think the different risks are . You don ’ t have to make it your job to do something about it . Just put it in your brain so you ’ re primed to pay attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of change are specific events , news stories , or breakthroughs that are happening now . They ’ re clues to what the future might be like . Wuhan was a signal . And then Italy was a signal . And then New York City was a signal . The problem for most people is that they look at one instance of change and they see it as isolated ; they don ’ t understand the pattern it ’ s a part of . If you make it a habit to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better at spotting these growing risks faster . I think of the signals and future forces as stars versus constellations . If my mind is primed to know that there might be an entire constellation in this patch of sky , then if I see one star — one signal — my mind won ’ t assume this is an isolated incident . It ’ ll think there ’ s probably a bunch of other stars in this patch of sky . That ’ s a great analogy . And there ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of change , in that you are kind of playing connect-the-dots . What is the main goal of running a pandemic simulation ? Should we be thinking of these simulations more as a tool to influence policymakers or to influence regular citizens ? My personal belief up until the year 2020 was that the primary purpose of these simulations was to have a transformative impact on the participants ... to create more people who are more flexible in their thinking about the world . I see it as a skill set we ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — that if we have millions of people who have already thought about this kind of crisis , that will diffuse during the real crisis . Now , having seen hard-to-predict social consequences fairly well predicted by players , I would like to make an effort to translate some of these experiences into more actionable advice . To give [ policymakers ] actionable information , like , “ Here are going to be the main obstacles and here are going to be the top conspiracy theories , so you can think about countering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ’ d heard of pre-Covid seem to have been run with academic experts and government officials in the hopes of getting policymakers to break out of the pandemic panic-neglect cycle — to prime them to take pandemic prevention seriously and respond well if a crisis actually happens . How hopeful are you that we can run simulations that are actually effective at shaping policymakers ’ decisions ? It really depends on your theory of change . With simulations as they ’ ve historically been run within government , I ’ m not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what they find , because of bureaucracy [ that constricts what any one expert or official can do about pandemic policy ] . But when we have ordinary people play these simulations out in the real world , it ’ s like a rehearsal for demanding action . We should as a public be able to demand policy or change with our own foresight . It ’ s not just to put pressure on [ officials ] to enact the policy , but also to give them permission . It ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future risk when there ’ s social demand for it . So I do think it ’ s necessary for the public to be involved for these simulations to really drive substantive policy change . We ’ re seeing right now , for example , that Congress is not devoting nearly enough funding to preventing the next pandemic . So you ’ re saying maybe if the public were more primed in our imaginations to anticipate that another pandemic is absolutely coming and we should invest more in preventing it , our pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Exactly . Now , this is very optimistic . The largest simulations I ’ ve run have 20,000 people . This is assuming we could get that number up to 200,000 or 2 million . I don ’ t know of any significant funding source for this type of work . Part of the reason I wrote this book is to try to create a movement of people who want to invest in this idea of simulating futures with the public and not just behind closed doors . In terms of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this something that we should be teaching as part of the curriculum in every high school and college , in the same way that many now teach critical thinking or critical reading skills ? Absolutely . One of the big moonshots for the Institute for the Future is to get futures thinking into more high school and university classrooms . We ’ re actually partnering with some projects to do that . In California , there ’ s a project called California 100 . We ’ ve been helping them develop future scenarios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next 100 years , and they ’ re looking to engage high school students and college students in this type of futures thinking as a way of trying to build out this skill set in the population . Why do we need simulations to build this skill set ? Why can ’ t we just have fiction ? The thing about a social simulation is that you ’ re imagining yourself in a future scenario . It ’ s not a character ; you ’ re not role-playing someone other than yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you ’ re creating memories in your mind of the future that are actually very similar to real memories . It becomes easier for you to imagine these things you ’ ve never experienced because you ’ re committing the information to your brain in a different way , where it feels more like a personal lived experience than some kind of vicarious narrative . The core mechanic of these simulations is essentially five-minute journal entries from the future . We ask you to take five minutes to write in as vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing on this day that ’ s different because there ’ s a pandemic ? What emotions are you feeling ? We ask people to write it down as if it ’ s already happened so that it becomes a memory rather than an abstract fact . And this is the big thing that really drives my work : the difference between abstract facts and lived experience in terms of how the brain processes information . What is the difference , neurologically , between how each of those gets processed ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thousands of papers written in the past decade about exactly what happens when you imagine the future . They parse out essentially two networks of future thought . One is semantic , which is basically just : What are the facts about this future ? This is mostly hippocampus-driven . When most of us think about the future , we tend to think about it in that very abstract , semantic way . But then there ’ s episodic futures thinking ( EFT ) , which engages many more regions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to picture ourselves living through the future . It ’ s almost like watching a movie in our mind . We can look around and really see and hear and touch , and we tell stories about our lived experiences of something in the future . I try to create a world where literally anybody can look around and say , “ Oh , hey , I can see how this would affect me , and here ’ s how I would feel or act. ” That ’ s something futurists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often write very abstract reports . And it ’ s just hard for people to understand what it means for them . You write about studies showing that the emotions you feel during EFT are just as psychologically powerful as emotions that you actually experience in the present . The intensity of emotion that you feel can make an imagined future more vivid and salient , so you ’ re more likely to pay attention to it or be motivated to act on it . Are there other benefits to EFT ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re pre-feeling negative emotions , it can be a kind of therapeutic intervention against future trauma . Essentially you can do exposure therapy to some of these scenarios , so that instead of feeling emotions like shock and anxiety , the feelings that come up first are more like pre-recognition or familiarity . That ’ s really interesting because those are positive emotions . Pre-recognition is the sense of , “ I saw this coming. ” It gives you a kind of confidence , right ? Your brain says , “ I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Just that tiny spark of positive emotion can help you pivot from shock or denial or helplessness so you can move faster into preparing yourself and helping others .

"As expected, the U.S. House of Representatives failed to pass a stopgap government funding measure today, with 21 right-wing Republicans joining Democrats to sink the conservative (but apparently not conservative enough) bill on a 198-232 vote. That means that the government is likely headed for a shutdown tomorrow at midnight, unless some magical bipartisan deal emerges in the next 33 hours. Even if the House stopgap bill had passed today, a shutdown would have still been on the horizon, since the Democratic-controlled Senate and White House opposed the House’s proposal. Among New Jersey representatives, today’s vote was party-line: all Republicans in favor, all Democrats opposed. The state’s three Republican representatives have typically not been among those Republicans who have bucked party leadership on spending bills."

""""""" Ukraine ’ s National Cancer Institute occupies three smoke-grey , six‑storey blocks in a residential district on the edge of Kiev . The external walls are tiled , with occasional scars where the bricks peep through . When Soviet workmen completed the facade , they built the date – “ 1968 ” – into it . Since then , maintenance appears to have been erratic . Nonetheless , business at the institute has always been brisk , and is getting brisker .

Radiation from the Chernobyl disaster spread thyroid cancers throughout the 1980s generation , increasing the incidence among children tenfold . There are few family doctors , which means that breast , prostate and bowel tumours often go undetected for months . Survival rates for these cancers are among the worst in Europe . In 2008 , Professor Igor Shchepotin , an experienced Ukrainian-born surgeon , predicted in a magazine interview that the number of new diagnoses of cancer would continue to rise from 165,000 annually to 200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viktor Yushchenko picked Shchepotin out as Ukraine ’ s champion in a new war on cancer . Shchepotin took charge of the Cancer Institute , which is both the country ’ s leading cancer hospital and its premier research institution , and was granted extensive powers to mend Ukraine ’ s health , including a budget independent of the health ministry , so that he could buy his own medicines and equipment . In Britain , he would be known as the “ cancer tsar ” ; in Ukraine , he is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has been an effective one , according to the institute ’ s own assessment . “ Under the leadership of Professor Shchepotin , new approaches , conceptions and technology have been introduced , new principles for treating cancer patients , a significant proportion of whom have been returned to a fully active life , ” the institute said in a summary of its work published in April . The Cancer Institute , though no more modern inside than out , feels reassuring . Surgeons in white coats discuss cases as they walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , bearing armfuls of folders . In the corridors , patients sit on folding cinema-style seats talking on their phones , while their relatives try to catch the doctors ’ attention . Old women dressed in green scrubs mop floors with disinfectant , giving the building a chemical tang that clings to your clothes long after you leave . It feels like a place where patients can come knowing that the goal is to get them well again . But three surgeons working here , a former health minister , patients and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the whole story . They claim that the hospital , like government bodies all over Ukraine , appears to have been infected by corruption . And despite widespread public anger at the nation ’ s corruption problem , which has provoked two revolutions in a decade , no one appears able or willing to do anything about it . “ Presumably there is money , ” said Konstantin Sidorenko , a consultant anaesthetist at the institute , when we first met in July . “ But for some reason that money doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like intensive care . So it means we have to earn everything ourselves. ” The phrase “ earn everything ourselves ” , he explained , is a euphemism for taking bribes , though Sidorenko was quick to point out that this wasn ’ t something he wanted to do . He led the team of doctors running intensive care , so he was responsible for the institute ’ s most vulnerable patients . Clinically , he felt he had no choice but to take the money . We were on the sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was about the size of a typical bathroom . Sidorenko , who had greying , wavy hair and a friendly , open face , reached into the pocket of his white coat and took out a small cubic box . It contained an oxygen sensor for a respirator , the machines that provide air for patients unable to breathe for themselves . Each sensor costs around 4,000 hryvnias ( UAH ) , currently £164 , and each of his 10 respirators needs a replacement sensor at least once a year : UAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that is just a tiny part of the money he needs to keep his machines working , which exceeds UAH 700,000 ( £28,850 ) annually . For the last two years , he claimed , the institute had not provided him with sufficient money for maintenance , despite his repeated requests at clinical meetings . “ I have equipment worth millions , and I need to service it or it will break and my patients will die . I need to service it , but where do I get the money ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dilemma : be honest and a bad doctor , or take bribes and be a good doctor . It is humiliating , but there is only one answer . “ My doctors understand , and the patients pay , ” Sidorenko said . Behind my chair was a tall settle , the kind found in former Soviet flats from Kiev to Kamchatka . The top half was a display cabinet full of medical books and files . Below that was a cupboard . Sidorenko squeezed past me to open the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall it required both hands to steady it . Some of them were half an inch thick , and all of them were full of banknotes . He explained that almost all of his doctors collect the money from patients , then pass it on to him . He uses it to maintain the machines that keep his patients alive . These are the realities of being a doctor in Ukraine , he said . He was better qualified than most to assess the situation , since he sat on the commission that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he had seen how the hospital systematically overpays for the equipment it buys and alleged that the institute had once bought a respirator for €130,000 more than it was worth . That €130,000 would have supplied his respirators with sensors for 40 years . Sidorenko had only one explanation for why the hospital would overpay for equipment : some managers were engaged in secret deals with the suppliers to defraud the state budget , and then dividing up the extra money among themselves . Essentially , Sidorenko ’ s patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the shortfall . Shchepotin , the head of the institute , refused to comment on the specific allegations made by Sidorenko that such practices were taking place at the institute . Sidorenko had another reason to be frustrated . He had 23 years of experience , but earned only €300 a month , barely enough to feed his four young children , let alone to pay the numerous small bribes – to teachers , traffic police , plumbers , tax officers – that are part of everyday life in Ukraine . Kiev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chain stores , sweeping central avenues , a metro , everything required to make a place look European . But it resembles a modern European capital city only in the way the Cancer Institute resembles a hospital . Transparency International ’ s Corruption Perceptions Index – the most widely used indicator of corruption worldwide – rates Ukraine 142nd in the world , alongside Uganda . In the latest ranking , it fell behind Nigeria . Since 1991 , officials , members of parliament and businessmen have created complex and highly lucrative schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft has crippled Ukraine . The economy was as large as Poland ’ s at independence , now it is a third of the size . Ordinary Ukrainians have seen their living standards stagnate , while a handful of oligarchs have become billionaires . Public fury has fuelled two revolutions . In 2004 , street protests helped Viktor Yushchenko defeat an attempt by the then prime minister Viktor Yanukovych to rig the presidential election . During his five years in power , however , Yushchenko failed to dislodge the networks of patronage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 election to Yanukovych , who was in turn driven out in February 2014 , after corruption mutated into still more virulent forms . Officials from the general prosecutor ’ s office , who were interviewed by Reuters , claimed that between 2010 and 2014 , officials were stealing a fifth of the country ’ s national output every year . This behaviour has infected all sectors of Ukrainian society . President Yanukovych lived in a vast palace on the edge of Kiev . After he fled , protesters found millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ceramics stacked in his garage . He ’ d had nowhere to display them . The protesters camping out on the Maidan in central Kiev last winter wanted to prevent a repeat of 2004 , when the old networks of corruption simply absorbed the new officials . Among those protesters was Andrei Semivolos , a pale , slim , dark-haired surgeon from the Cancer Institute with a mauve birthmark on his right temple . He had volunteered as a medic during the protests on the Maidan , patching up protesters beaten by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institute determined to help change his workplace as he had helped change the government . One of President Yanukovych ’ s last attempts to salvage his image had been a televised visit to the institute , when he had handed out gifts to sick children , their heads bald from chemotherapy . Shchepotin , the chief oncologist , stood by his side , beaming . The publicity stunt failed to rehabilitate Yanukovych ’ s reputation , and a fortnight later , on 22 February 2014 , he fled . Soon after , Shchepotin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporter of Yanukovych , announced that the institute would be raising money to support the new government ’ s army – a move that surprised Semivolos . To him , it sounded like Shchepotin was trying to ingratiate himself with the new order . Semivolos wrote a long Facebook post on 20 March , in which he criticised the way Ukraine is run , Shchepotin , and what he called “ past-it Soviet relics ” . Facebook had played an important role in catalysing the protests that swelled into revolution over the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go viral and quickly energise mass protests . Shchepotin moved fast to respond to Semivolos ’ s criticism by convening the Cancer Institute ’ s “ collective ” . Gathering the “ collective ” is a Soviet-era practice that nominally allows workers to hold managers to account . Managers control attendance , however , meaning they can keep a tight grip on proceedings . “ You get the impression that among us there is only one hero who won the revolution , and who ’ s now fighting for the truth , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you are seriously mistaken , Dr Semivolos . Here are your colleagues and they are looking you in the eyes and saying what they think of you. ” Shchepotin pointed out that Semivolos ’ s team of doctors had the worst performance record in the hospital , and speculated that Semivolos had posted the criticism to distract attention from his own incompetence . Those present voted unanimously to condemn Semivolos and to declare his opinion of Shchepotin false . For good measure , TV cameras came in to film tearful co-workers upbraiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation . Among a crowd of colleagues , he looked pale and alone . In April , Semivolos responded by setting up a trade union with a dozen or so like-minded colleagues . He organised two protests outside the health ministry to demand an investigation into the hospital , to ask – among other questions – why no action had been taken after a 2009 probe suggested evidence of corruption there . “ We must remove corruption in Ukrainian healthcare like we would a malignant tumour , ” he wrote on Facebook on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success looked slim . Semivolos and his friends were fighting a hardened bureaucracy that was reasserting itself . There might have been a revolution on the Maidan , but here in the institute , it seemed that everything would proceed as normal . Semivolos , however , was not alone . He had gained an ally in a very high place . After Yanukovych fled last February , the new administration – headed by the speaker of parliament , who became acting president – gave control of most ministries to insiders and veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how the old elite had clung on to power . Three new ministers , however , came from the Maidan protesters , and one of them was Oleg Musy . Slim and tanned , with a slight , grey beard , he looks like a 1970s musician – perhaps a member of the Police – on a comeback tour . Musy had headed the Maidan ’ s medical volunteers , organising treatment for hypothermia and gunshot wounds . In February , he became the new health minister , and embarked on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform Ukrainian healthcare along European lines , and to clean up the process whereby the state buys drugs and equipment . Traditionally , Ukrainian officials have had wide discretion over which companies to approve and which to exclude , which , it is claimed , gives them the chance to make insider deals , inflate prices and steal with impunity . Musy wanted to end this practice and to dismiss anyone found to be involved in these deals . This was a dangerous undertaking . In 2009 , Yushchenko had commissioned a security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to lead an internal report into healthcare corruption . The report exposed how businessmen use offshore shell companies to conspire with corrupt officials , rig state tenders and jack up prices . Within weeks of the report being completed , an assailant threw a grenade at the operative who had written it , as he got out of his car on Tatarska Street in central Kiev . Shrapnel shredded his car , and scarred the nearby buildings . The man survived but only after extensive surgery at a specialist unit in Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ – although it was leaked online – and the assailant was never found . Musy was not deterred , however , and began work on his reforms as soon as he took up his position . When I met him in August , he was startlingly open about the problems he faced . For a health system to function , he said , it needs 6-7 % of all the money a country earns . The Ukrainian government was allocating only 3.5 % , yet mysteriously the system continued to limp along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t it died altogether ? ” he said . “ And the answer is that additional finances are found from somewhere . Today the state pays around UAH 52bn ( £2.1bn ) into the healthcare system . Naturally , around the same amount is coming from somewhere else. ” If Musy ’ s sums are correct , every man , woman and child in Ukraine pays an average of UAH 1,000 ( £41 ) in bribes each year to keep the healthcare system operational . Considering that so much of the health budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used productively – Musy put theft from the medicines budget alone at 30-40 % – the total is likely to be far higher . Among many examples , he said that in 2013 the ministry had bought 1,412 new ambulances , with the price of every vehicle inflated by UAH 200,000 ( £8,223 ) – almost 50 % of their true cost . “ This isn ’ t business , it is earning money dishonestly , ” he said . Musy said a key front in his campaign for reform was the Cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced the results of an investigation into the hospital , detailing 43 alleged violations of the law . Among them were claims that patients had been forced to buy expensive medicines , even though those medicines had already been paid for by the state , and that equipment costing around UAH 42 million , bought in 2011 , was gathering dust in a store cupboard , never used , with the warranty expired . “ This is the personal responsibility of the director , ” Musy claimed in interviews with reporters . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police , who would interview Shchepotin in his capacity as head of the institute . He believed that the suspicion alone was grounds to sack Shchepotin , although that could not happen just yet , because Shchepotin had gone on sick leave . Under Ukrainian law , that meant he could not be dismissed for four months , not until October . In brief comments to the Guardian , Shchepotin stated that claims of criminality at the institute were “ lies ” . He refused to comment on further questions about widespread corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentary broadcast on 20 December , Sergei Kaplin , a populist member of Ukraine ’ s parliament , who presents a weekly investigative series called People ’ s Prosecutor , challenged Shchepotin over corruption allegations . In one scene , Kaplin burst into Shchepotin ’ s office with a camera crew . Shchepotin repeatedly refused to talk to him , unless he produced a search warrant . Most patients come to the Cancer Institute via regional hospitals , so relatives caring for them need to find accommodation in Kiev . A charity called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provides rooms for six families , in a large , detached house on a winding suburban street not far from the institute . Zaporuka ’ s budget is about €500,000 a year – most of this comes from European donors – and it pays the salaries of two psychologists and two physiotherapists who work at the Cancer Institute . Natalia Onipko , who heads Zaporuka , is slight , with her blonde hair in a bob that falls onto her shoulders . “ I often think about how much easier it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could just do what they are supposed to be doing , ” she told me . In a decade of working with parents , almost all of whom had paid bribes so their children could be treated , Onipko had never known anyone make an official complaint . “ They ’ re scared , of course they ’ re scared , ” she explained . “ Any scandal would end with them being sent back to their regional hospital . Do you understand what that would mean ? ” Facilities are basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there receive care from the country ’ s top specialists , something they could not hope for in the provinces . Doctors have total discretion over which patients to admit or discharge , so it is not surprising that parents are anxious to keep them happy : giving them gifts , paying the amounts suggested , never speaking out . There are more cancer patients than there are beds – being sent back home would be a death sentence . We walked through to the kitchen , where six women sat around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were old friends rather than strangers brought together by the awful coincidence of their children having cancer . At first , when I spoke to them , it seemed the mothers were reluctant to admit to breaking the law . It soon turned out they were simply struggling to understand what I was asking . Bribes were so ordinary that it seemed bizarre someone would have come all the way from Britain to ask questions about them . Eventually , however , one woman , who was from eastern Ukraine , explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ He wrote 100 on a piece of paper , then pointed his fingers upwards . That meant dollars. ” That prompted another woman to recall an encounter with a different doctor : “ I remember the first time I saw him , he was winking and nodding his head , and I thought he had a tic or something ; that he was mentally unwell . But actually he was catching my attention . Then he held out two fingers. ” Here she placed two fingers on her arm , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant 200. ” “ Hundred ? ” a third woman asked , “ you mean thousand. ” They all laughed . As we walked out , Onipko explained that one of her most important jobs was to keep these parents ’ spirits up . They were not only struggling to support their children through a terrible illness , but also trying to navigate a health system apparently determined to exploit their desperation for financial gain . “ I try not to criticise the doctors in front of the parents , because they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I heard the same stories throughout the institute : there was little money for maintenance , medicine or salaries , little interest in the patients , or in the medics doing the work of keeping people alive . One morning , I visited one of the institute ’ s laboratories . Apart from some microscopes – given by donors eight years ago – the equipment in the department had not changed for two decades , according to one person who worked there . From the facilities you would never have guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s most important departments . Patients ’ biopsies were stored on their original slides , between cardboard dividers , and kept in an index , like in an old library . These slides are crucial for diagnosing cancer . Doctors look at them through microscopes to determine the type and virulence of a patient ’ s condition . Examples have to be stored in case the patient suffers a relapse . To prepare the biopsies , the lab workers drip purple dye onto slides suspended over an enamelled basin , which was once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is now dark purple . Months passed before I next saw Oleg Musy , in a canteen in central Kiev , in one of the battered and dirty buildings that had been used as a headquarters for the revolutionaries . It was November and he wore a black leather jacket against the cold . He looked paler , and tired . The previous month , on 1 October , Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk had suspended Musy from his duties . Musy had , he said , failed to buy the medicines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , with the Ukrainian army at war with Russian-backed separatists in the east , the economy contracting , the currency plunging . The government needed competent officials , not revolutionaries engaged in quixotic ideological crusades . Over the previous few months , many of Musy ’ s supporters had turned against him . Patients of Ukraine , a charity that campaigns vigorously against corruption , accused Musy of conducting his battles at the price of sacrificing sick Ukrainians . It was urgent that the ministry buy drugs , they said , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the businessmen who got rich from corrupt deals with the old government . That was not a point of view Musy shared . “ I will tell the truth , ” he said . “ The prime minister sent people from his own team to watch what was happening in the health ministry . I did not agree with their schemes , specifically with them maintaining the old … schemes during the health ministry tenders. ” After Musy was suspended from his position , the old networks had re-established themselves , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Musy claimed that some of the officials who ran procurement under Yanukovych were back , because the new government had failed to find anyone else with the expertise to navigate the ocean of paperwork required to buy medicine . Musy said this left the system open to the same kind of abuse the revolutionaries had promised to end . “ It ’ s right that the west doesn ’ t want to give us money , that they say we ’ re not fighting against corruption . There isn ’ t a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what about the Cancer Institute ? On 2 October , the day after Musy ’ s suspension , Shchepotin returned to work . Had Musy kept his powers for three more days , he claims he could have sacked Shchepotin , whose four months of sick leave was almost spent . “ He was ill for four months , and had only three more days in which to be ill . But I was suspended , and he came back to work. ” The next evening , I visited Semivolos in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out how his battle with Shchepotin was going . Semivolos made us tea and we sat in the kitchen . His wife kept us company and his son came in occasionally to give them both hugs . It was a cosy scene , the fridge covered in colourful magnets from foreign cities , cakes on the table , but he was gloomy . He began our conversation with a 20-minute overview of the last millennium of Ukraine ’ s history . The basic message was one of survival against catastrophic odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French have ? Four ? And only then did they get their republic , ” he said . “ We have total corruption – it couldn ’ t be more total . Cleaners don ’ t clean if you don ’ t give them money ; ministers won ’ t govern if you don ’ t give them money. ” The personal clash between Semivolos and Shchepotin is now playing out in court . Shchepotin has sued Semivolos for defamation for his Facebook posts , claiming that “ the negative information causes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honour , my dignity , and my good name . People have lost their trust in me as a doctor , and now are unwilling to come to me for help. ” The hearings are ongoing . Semivolos laughed it off , but the issue is serious – Ukraine ’ s courts can be unpredictable . During my time in the institute , I only saw Shchepotin once . He was at the end of a corridor , walking away from me , and was gone before I could get close . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to answer any questions about the specific allegations made against the institute and him . He insisted that he really had been ill and rejected any suggestion that the health ministry investigation had uncovered anything serious . “ There are a few facts , but they are not cause for an investigation , a probe , or anything , ” he said . When I asked him about the defamation case he had brought against Semivolos , he said I was an “ unserious person ” , and “ interested in gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the kind of things you find in the tabloids , and I don ’ t give interviews to the tabloids. ” Then he put the phone down . I sent a list of further questions via his secretary , but she returned it with the words “ no comment ” scrawled on it above his initials and the date – 27 November . I sent further requests for comment , detailing the allegations in this article , but they went unanswered . That same day , 27 November , Ukraine ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Oleg Musy , who had been elected to represent a constituency in western Ukraine ’ s Lviv region . I watched the proceedings on a television in a small Kiev cafe called Mon Ami .

He was late , bustling in and excusing himself with a wave in the direction of the television , where a succession of deputies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to combat corruption . My source looked exhausted , and started explaining the situation before he had even removed his coat . “ It ’ s really difficult to beat these people . They control everything . It is like a hydra .

They look fine , they look respectable , but behind the curtain there is blood. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had mushroom soup . We sat watching the deputies on television milling about : many of them in uniform , others in the embroidered shirts that are a nationalist symbol . Yatsenyuk and President Petro Poroshenko appeared together in a show of unity . There was a brief glimpse of Musy on screen , his handsome face turned towards one of his fellow members of parliament , listening patiently . “ It ’ s a real problem , ” my lunch partner said , nodding towards the dethroned health minister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriot but a disastrous manager , or an effective manager with questions hanging over him ? ” I ate my soup and we discussed how businessmen who had got rich under Yanukovych , had quietly returned to Kiev in recent months . “ We took away Yanukovych and his guys but it ’ s another matter replacing all their schemes , ” he said . “ Everyone is ready to carry out reforms , to make everything open , except for things that affect themselves. ” On 2 December , parliament approved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third in the year .

"In more than a dozen interviews, young Jewish Americans, many in their teens or 20s, described their experiences in the week since Hamas launched an attack into Israel, killing more than 1,300 people, including an estimated 260 at a music festival. They spoke of fear and shock, solidarity and helplessness, a newfound bond with some friends and an estrangement from others. Like many young people, they are still sorting out how they see the world, and what might have felt certain a week ago — about friends, values and identity — has been upended by the events in Israel and Gaza. A 19-year-old in Washington said he has been responding to texts from his former campers asking if he knew whether fellow counselors of his from Israel, who spent the summer at their Jewish overnight camp in Wisconsin, were still alive. A high school senior on Long Island said she had grown nervous about explaining the Hebrew letters on her necklace to people who asked about it at the smoothie place where she works. A college senior in Philadelphia said he was reluctant now to express his criticism of the Israeli government’s policies toward Palestinians, having seen that people who said similar things were being doxxed or accused of supporting Hamas."
""""""" What happens when you add massive amounts of carbohydrates in the form of whole grains to the daily diet of people with type 2 diabetes ? Why are macrobiotic diets apparently so effective at reducing blood sugar levels in diabetics within just a few weeks ’ time ? The diet is centered around whole grains—brown rice , barley , and millet—so might the high fiber intake improve the gut microbiome , the friendly flora in our colon , which then leads to a reduction in insulin resistance ? Or , perhaps it ’ s because the diet is also rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of low-grade acidosis from the high levels of animal protein in their regular ( non-macrobiotic ) diets . Regardless of the reason , researchers found a significant difference after just 21 days . Can macrobiotic diets also help with longer term blood sugar control ? I examine this in my video Flashback Friday : Benefits of a Macrobiotic Diet for Diabetes . How about a six-month dietary intervention with wildly out-of-control blood sugars ? As you can see at 0:51 in my video , hemoglobin A1c offers a sense of one ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months . An A1c level of 5 , for example , would mean that your blood sugars have been in the double digits most of the time over the last few months , indicating that your sugars have been at a normal , healthy , non diabetic level . But , an A1c of 6 is prediabetes territory and 6.5 can be a sign of full-blown diabetes ; an A1c under 7 is considered controlled diabetes—what diabetics are striving towards with pills and insulin injections—and a level over 7 is considered out-of-control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average A1c level started out off-the-charts at 12.6 . The subjects had been averaging blood sugars in the 300s for months , despite all having been on insulin injections . What happened when the study participants were placed on the so-called Ma-Pi 2 diet , a strictly plant-based macrobiotic-style diet centered around whole grains , vegetables , and beans , with some sesame seeds and green tea ? After just six months on the diet , their A1c levels dropped from a wildly out-of-control diabetic 12.6 to averaging a non diabetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the subjects were getting daily insulin injections when their A1c was an astronomical 12.6 , they achieved non diabetic 5.7 on the diet after they had all been able to eliminate their insulin . Within only six months , 100 percent of the study participants started out on insulin with out-of-control diabetes and ended with 0 percent on insulin and averaging non diabetic blood sugars . That ’ s the power of plants . Also within those six months , three-quarters were off all of their diabetes medications completely . Any side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 20 percent and their triglycerides dropped by nearly 40 percent . ( And , of course , let ’ s not forget that anyone starting a strictly plant-based diet must ensure a regular , reliable source of vitamin B12 . ) All we needed was a randomized , controlled trial , and we got one : Type 2 diabetics were randomized to the macrobiotic diet versus the recommended American Diabetes Association-type diet . You can see an example of a typical day on the macrobiotic diet below and at 2:59 in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake for breakfast ; brown rice sesame balls for a snack ; a vegetable millet soup with a brown rice salad , a lot of vegetable sides , and adzuki beans for lunch ; more whole grain snacks ; and , similar to lunch , a dinner of vegetable barley soup with a lot of vegetables and chickpeas ; and green tea throughout the day . On the more standard diabetic diet , participants might have low-fat milk and whole-wheat bread for breakfast ; a Mediterranean lunch with vegetables and beans ; fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetable soup , whole-grain bread , agretti ( a green leafy vegetable ) , and baked fish for dinner . I have to say , that ’ s a pretty healthy control diet . The researchers could have compared the macrobiotic diet to a trashy one , but they wanted to stack it up against the diet diabetes groups recommend . So , what happened ? The macrobiotic diet won out on every measure of blood sugar control . You can view the numbers in the graph below and at 4:00 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study , participants had fasting blood sugars in the 120s . That ’ s bad , but they were diabetics , after all . Normal fasting blood sugars , like when you wake up in the morning before having breakfast , should be at least in the double digits and under 100 . When subjects were put on the relatively healthy , more standard diabetic diet , their blood sugars got better over the three-week study , dropping from the 120s down into the 110s . ( That ’ s the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Compare that to an isocaloric macrobiotic diet , meaning with the same number of calories . On the macrobiotic diet , subjects improved within days and achieved normal fasting blood sugars within a week . A full 100 percent of those on the macrobiotic diet got their fasting blood sugars under 110 , whereas less than half of those on the diabetes diet did . And , that was achieved while on fewer drugs . In the control group , one participant was able to reduce their oral hypoglycemic medications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs in the macrobiotic group had to stop taking them . Otherwise , if they had continued taking the drugs , their blood sugars would have fallen too low . So , the macrobiotic diet gave better results on fewer drugs . That ’ s the power of a really healthy diet . As an aside , what a poke in the eye with a sharp stick this study was to the low-carb crowd ! Researchers took diabetics and put them on a 73 percent carbohydrate diet , adding 100 grams of carbs—in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their daily diet . And what happened ? Did their blood sugars skyrocket out of control ? No , they got significantly better in a matter of days , with average fasting blood sugars starting out at 129 and falling to 95 . And , in just three weeks , their bad LDL cholesterol plummeted down to 62 , a nearly 48 percent drop . Is the macrobiotic diet perfect ? No , but I offer some suggestions for improving it in my video Flashback Friday : Pros and Cons of a Macrobiotic @ @ """""""

"PARIS, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Australia's Ben Donaldson scored two tries to fire his side to a comfortable 35-15 bonus-point victory over Georgia in their World Cup opener on Saturday, giving the twice world champions a morale-boosting first win in six tests this year. Livewire young backs Mark Nawaqanitawase and Jordan Petaia scored early tries to help the Wallabies to a 21-3 halftime lead before fullback Donaldson grabbed his brace to lift the Wallabies out of a second-half lull at the Stade de France. Donaldson, a surprise selection brought into the side primarily for his place-kicking, added 15 points from the tee with three penalties and three conversions."
"“There is a huge swath of people who just don’t know anything. There’s also a segment of people that want him to do more. There’s also a swath that thinks he’s gone too far,” Lori Lodes, the executive director of Climate Power, said in an interview last week. “We need to make sure that the Biden coalition, the folks who got him into office in 2020, sees that he’s delivered on his promises. And he has.” As with so much of Mr. Biden’s agenda, his climate policies tend to poll well on their own but do worse when associated with the president. A Washington Post poll from July found that 70 percent of Americans, including 51 percent of Republicans, would like the next president be someone who favors government action to address climate change. And Climate Power’s own research showed that 67 percent of voters believe climate to be a “kitchen table issue.” Yet even though Democratic majorities in Congress last year passed, and Mr. Biden signed, the Inflation Reduction Act — legislation that invests $370 billion in spending and tax credits in zero-emission forms of energy to fight climate change — there is little evidence that he has earned the political benefits from voters who share his climate goals."

"Part of the Series The Public Intellectual Former President Donald Trump has achieved a unique status in United States history. He is the first president to be indicted for conspiring to overturn a presidential election, defraud the U.S. and obstruct official proceedings by attempting to subvert the peaceful transfer of power. It’s now a matter of public record that Trump faces four indictments and 91 felony counts for his criminal behavior. As Alan Feuer and Maggie Haberman point out in The New York Times, the charges clearly depict how “Trump promoted false claims of fraud, sought to bend the Justice Department toward supporting those claims and oversaw a scheme to create false slates of electors pledged to him in states that were actually won by Joseph R. Biden Jr.” And Special Counsel Jack Smith has shown that Trump’s lies played a central role in his “unprecedented assault” on the U.S. Capitol and democracy; indeed, he argues, Trump’s criminal actions were “fueled by lies.”"

"One outcome of Mexico’s general elections of 2 June 2024 is guaranteed: for the next six years, a woman will lead the country. Barring surprises, all the polls are predicting that the new president will be Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, the candidate for the governing coalition of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), the Labour Party (PT) and the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM). In early September, Sheinbaum was selected after five surveys of MORENA members. She is expected to continue the policies of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (‘AMLO’), who won a landslide victory in 2018 and whose ‘Fourth Transformation’ has fundamentally changed the balance of power. Another reason it’s virtually certain that Mexico will have a woman for president is that Frente Amplio por México (Broad Front for Mexico) – the alliance of the three most important opposition parties, which had dominated Mexican politics for decades before MORENA was founded in 2014 – has also chosen a woman candidate. Largely unknown two months ago, Senator Xóchitl Gálvez Ruiz has managed to shake up the normally predictable politics by clashing publicly with AMLO, who repeatedly attacked her in his morning press conferences. Her bold campaign put her in the national spotlight, and in June, her surging popularity pushed opposition party leaders to abandon their candidate selection process (submitting 150,000 signatures of supporters, followed by a nationwide poll and a primary). The other candidates in the tripartite oppositional alliance of the authoritarian Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled for some 70 years, the conservative National Action Party (PAN), which succeeded it for two presidential terms, and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) have to put a good face on the matter. Who are the candidates?"

"The tea party that Skocpol was referring to no longer formally exists as a faction in Congress, its erstwhile allies having been subsumed into the far-right Freedom Caucus or into the generic “America First” wing of the GOP. But according to Skocpol, the history of the tea party remains essential to understanding the forces that ultimately led to McCarthy’s political demise. “It represents the culmination of [the tea party movement],” said Skocpol. “All the research that I and other political scientists have done on the movement shows that by the 2010s — just before Donald Trump emerges — the tea party had taken the shape of a just-say-no, blow-it-all-up, don’t-cooperate, do-politics-on-Twitter faction — and this is the perfect expression of it. This is where it leads.” In some respects, Skocpol’s argument is counterintuitive. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, McCarthy and the other Young Guns rose to power by harnessing the grassroots power of the tea party movement, promising to slash government spending, constrain federal power and foil the Obama administration’s policy goals. But though McCarthy and the other Young Guns rose to prominence by allying themselves with the tea party movement, Skocpol said, their banishment from the GOP doesn’t mark a break with the movement’s legacy. Instead, it shows that the Young Guns never really understood the forces that they helped unleash."

The original tweet contained the headline : “ Garland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI searched Mar-a-Lago. ” This headline is entirely accurate . Garland did in fact vow to depoliticize the Justice Department , and the FBI did in fact raid Mar-a-Lago . But nope . Can ’ t criticize the Biden Administration . Evidently , editors realized that the headline might be construed as critical so they changed it to : “ FBI ’ s search of Mar-a-Lago lands Merrick Garland in a political firestorm. ” The original : “ Erupts in a political firestorm. ” That ’ s the kind of wordsmithing liberal outlets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wrongdoing was done by their favored people . Another technique is to instead of reporting on a story of what someone did , use the go-to “ Republicans Pounce ” headline . Don ’ t write , “ Paul Pelosi Was Caught Driving Drunk , ” write something like , “ Right Wing Websites Erupt Over Speaker ’ s Husband ’ s Driving Incident. ” See how it works ? But why did they remove the original headline ? Critics apparently thought it wasn ’ t anti-Trump enough . “ No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unraveling a crime spree committed by the former president of the United States , ” one user responded to the original . “ There…fixed it for you. ” NYU journalism teacher Jay Rosen , meanwhile said the original headline was “ painfully under-thought ” and “ seemed to say that Garland was shifting course and unduly politicizing DOJ. ” Well , yes , Garland was shifting course and unduly politicizing DOJ , and even left-leading outlets like CNN are talking about it .

""""""" Alec Baldwin speaks during the 2021 RFK Ripple Of Hope Gala at New York Hilton Midtown in New York on Dec. 9 , 2021 . ( Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images ) LOS ANGELES—Alec Baldwin has filed an arbitration claim against the producers of the movie “ Rust ” in a bid to shield himself from liability and cover his legal fees after the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the western last year . In the arbitration demand filed Friday , Baldwin alleges he was not responsible for the death of Hutchins , whom he shot during rehearsals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of Santa Fe , New Mexico . Seeking indemnification from the “ Rust ” production company , Baldwin reiterated earlier public statements , saying that he was not in charge of firearm safety or hiring and had been told the gun did not contain any live ammunition , according to the filing with the JAMS private arbitration service reviewed by the Los Angeles Times . “ This is a rare instance when the system broke down , and someone should be held legally culpable for the tragic consequences . That person is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the filing . “ October 21 was also the worst day in Alec Baldwin ’ s life . That day has and will continue to haunt Baldwin. ” A spokesman for the “ Rust ” producers had no immediate comment . The filing was first reported by The New York Times . The arbitration demand comes after Baldwin and other producers have been accused of negligence by the Hutchins family and others involved in the production . The lawsuits have cited the hiring of inexperienced crew and a raft of safety violations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal shooting . Baldwin has been outspoken about his belief that he is not responsible for the death of the 42-year-old rising-star cinematographer , including in an interview on ABC . Husband Matthew Hutchins expressed outrage over Baldwin ’ s response in an interview last month on NBC ’ s “ Today ” show . In Baldwin ’ s filing , the actor details how he tried to support Matthew Hutchins after the tragedy , but the relationship turned sour . Sharing screenshots of his correspondence with Matthew Hutchins , Baldwin said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confront the crisis together and that he was grateful for the actor ’ s offers of help and wanted to maintain a relationship with him . Baldwin added he arranged hotel accommodation for the family and spoke at the memorial . “ Alec Baldwin once again is trying to avoid liability and accountability for his reckless actions before and on Oct 21st that resulted in the death of Halyna Hutchins , ” Panish said in a statement . “ Baldwin ’ s disclosure of personal texts with Matt Hutchins is irrelevant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate anything other than Hutchins ’ dignity in his engagement with Baldwin. ” Aaron Dyer , Los Angeles-based attorney for Baldwin and other producers of “ Rust , ” has previously said that they continued to cooperate with the authorities to determine how live ammunition arrived on the “ Rust ” set . The filing downplayed Baldwin ’ s role in the movie , specifying that in small-budget films like “ Rust , ” he does not have the authority to choose crew or direct noncreative aspects of the production , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training by the armorer before filming started . The day after he arrived on set last October , he received 90 minutes of training from the armorer , Hannah Gutierrez Reed . Reed had also offered “ cross-draw ” training , which the actor said in his filing Friday was not focused on gun safety but the motion of pulling the gun from the holster . He said he did not need this training . The claim contradicts an assertion in the wrongful death lawsuit filed last month by the Hutchins family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baldwin . Their claim stated the actor refused training in the “ cross-draw ” maneuver that he was practicing that day—just 4 feet from Hutchins and other crew members . The Hutchins suit filed in New Mexico alleged that Baldwin and other producers of the low-budget film sacrificed crew members ’ safety by hiring inexperienced crew and disregarding safety concerns expressed earlier by camera crew operators . Baldwin in his arbitration claim said he wasn ’ t made aware of safety issues . He reiterated that at the time of the fatal scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant director Dave Halls and that Halls had said the gun was “ cold , ” which Baldwin said was a widely accepted term to indicate there was no real or blank ammunition in the gun . Hutchins directed Baldwin to hold the gun so it was pointed toward her and said that she wanted him to cock the gun , according to the actor ’ s filing . Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer of the gun but not enough to cock the gun , and when he let go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his total compensation for his appearance and producing “ Rust ” was $ 250,000 , but he gave back $ 100,000 as an investment in the movie . He said he was involved in talks about creative matters such as artwork for posters and worked with director Joel Souza on casting . Souza was also hit in the shooting by the same bullet that killed Hutchins but survived his injuries . In his claim against Rust Movie Productions LLC and producer Ryan Smith , Baldwin said that accidental killers report symptoms associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not help these individuals . “ Instead , we often pile on to the grief they are experiencing and villainize them as murderers , without putting ourselves in their shoes or considering who is truly culpable for the tragedy. ” Charges have yet to be filed in the ongoing criminal investigation into the incident by the Santa Fe County Sheriff ’ s Office that has focused on the actions of armorer Gutierrez Reed , assistant director Halls , and Baldwin . According to law enforcement documents , during a rehearsal , Halls gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronouncing it “ cold , ” to indicate there was no ammunition inside .

""""""" Biden is asking voters to look beyond the current financial pain , saying that what matters are the job gains that he believes his policies are fostering . The government reported Friday that employers added 261,000 jobs in October as the unemployment rate bumped up to 3.7 % . “ If you have a job , it ’ s small comfort to know that the job market is strong if at the same time you feel like every paycheck is worth less and less anyway , ” said pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson . “ Inflation is such political poison because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend money that it is a problem we are experiencing. ” Going into the election , Biden and Democrats are already at a disadvantage . Voters generally favor the party out of the White House in midterms , giving Republicans an automatic leg up . When Yale University economist Ray Fair looked at past elections , his model forecast that Democrats would get just 46.4 % of the national vote largely because Biden was in the Oval Office . Fair 's analysis suggests that inflation basically erased the political boost that Democrats could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three quarters in 2021 . Even if the economy is top of mind for many voters , the conflicting forces of past growth and high inflation cancel out each other . But inflation compounds the obstacles for a president who has tried to convey optimism as he tours the country in the run-up to the elections . Research in social psychology and behavioral economics generally shows that people often focus on the negatives and can block out the positives . Incantalupo 's research looks at how voters absorb economic news . When unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , voters generally think about jobs as a personal issue — rather than a systemic one involving government policies . But most think about inflation as a social problem beyond any person 's control , unless that individual happens to run the Fed . “ When it is high , everyone experiences it at least a little bit , and there really is no individual way to avoid it , ” Incantalupo said . “ Voters are going to look to government for remedies under those circumstances , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishing incumbents , even in the presence of other positive news about the economy. ” Republican candidates have specifically said Biden 's $ 1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package last year overheated the economy , causing prices to rise alongside the job gains that they claim would have happened anyway as the pandemic receded . They have also said that Biden should have loosened restrictions on oil production , in order to increase domestic output and lower gasoline prices . House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy — who could become speaker if the GOP wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high prices . As Biden has warned that Republicans who deny the outcome of the 2020 election are a threat to democracy , the California congressman countered that what voters care about are the costs of gas and groceries . Still , inflation is not solely a domestic issue . After Russia invaded Ukraine , energy and food costs rose and suddenly flipped the global dynamics as inflation rose faster in parts of the world with less aggressive coronavirus relief than the U.S . Annual inflation in the euro zone is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 8.2 % in the U.S . Meanwhile , growth has slowed in China , the pace of world trade is slipping and Saudi Arabia-led OPEC+ has cut oil production in order to prop up prices . And because the Fed is raising rates to lower domestic inflation , the dollar has increased in value and essentially exported higher prices to the rest of the world . """""""

Like, OK, this is definitely an American type: The PTA busybody nosing around and intoxicated by pettily using power to get their way. But that is an annoying type!

"Samuels Library has been lending books to the residents of rural Warren County, Virginia, for more than 200 years. But today, it’s continued existence is threatened by a small band of locals upset over the fact that it carries some titles with LGBTQ themes — or as the group calls them, books featuring “lesbian junk,” “homoerotic passages,” “sodomidical [sic] couples,” “witchcraft” as well as one volume considered objectionable because its protagonist “has an identity based on obesity.” Those complaints are drawn from the more than 800 removal requests filed by Clean Up Samuels, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by its rival organization, Save Samuels. Such efforts, fueled by a growing right-wing “parents rights” movement, are on the rise around the country, according to the organization PEN America, which began tracking them in 2021. This school year alone, the group says there have been 3,362 book bans of 1,557 titles across the country. In Warren County, Clean Up Samuels sprung up shortly after a local Moms for Liberty chapter was founded in February. When supervisors voted to defund the library in June, Moms for Liberty local chair Leslie Matthews, now a candidate for the local school board, appeared in support, as did another school board candidate, Tom McFadden, who spoke on Clean Up Samuels’ behalf, according to the group. Over the last three years in Virginia — ever since Governor Glenn Youngkin was swept into power on a tide of pent-up pandemic-festered parental rage, promising to ban “inherently divisive” works and put an end to mask mandates — school boards have become the red-hot center of political action, the site of heated arguments that have led to lawsuits and arrests. And this November, the races are attracting candidates with extreme views and donors with deep pockets."
"Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is seen next to Nikos Hardalias, who was on Sunday elected governor of the Attica region with the support of the conservative party. [Dimitris Papamitsos/Prime Minister's Office] Useful political conclusions can be gleaned from the results of Sunday’s regional elections, where ruling New Democracy, leftist opposition SYRIZA, socialist PASOK, and the Communist Party (KKE) had formally endorsed candidates in 13 regions. Although a direct comparison with the results of the national elections held this summer may not offer definitive conclusions – as voter preference is very much candidate-driven – regional polls do reflect broader societal trends and the evolving dynamics of the political landscape following a very challenging summer. Let’s delve into these findings more deeply. It is clear that Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ conservative party, just four months after the national elections, has reaffirmed its dominance by securing victory in 6+1 regions (including Crete) in the first round of voting on Sunday. Additionally, conservative candidates emerged as the front-runners in the remaining four out of six regions. This outcome effectively resets the political scoreboard, as it were, following the major challenges faced during the summer, as the governing party appears to have won a vote of confidence from the local communities. It is noteworthy that in many regions, New Democracy-backed candidates received a higher percentage of votes than the party did in the national elections."

""""""" The NCAA on Thursday released its new COVID-19 guidance for winter sports , and the guidance contains some important news . As ESPN reports , the NCAA ’ s COVID-19 Medical Advisory Group updated its definition of “ fully vaccinated ” to account for various new vaccinations , boosters , and immunity factors . “ Fully vaccinated individuals now include those within two months of receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine , five months of receiving the Pfizer vaccine series or six months of receiving the Moderna vaccine series ; ” reports ESPN staff writer Jeff Borzello , “ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have received the booster vaccine. ” But perhaps the biggest development came in the following line . “ Individuals within 90 days of a documented COVID-19 infection fall within the equivalent of ‘ fully vaccinated. ’ ” Natural Immunity is Now Considered Fully Vaccinated by NCAA In many parts of the world , including the United States , vaccine passports are required for travel . Vaccine passports are morally dubious for several reasons , but they seem particularly unjust for people who ’ ve already had COVID-19 , since they ’ ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have acquired natural immunity . Some evidence , such as a medical study out of Israel published in October , suggests that people with natural immunity actually have more protection from COVID-19 than vaccinated individuals . Dr. Anthony Fauci , the Director of the National Institutes of Health and the Chief Medical Advisor to the President , was recently asked on CNN about the Israeli study — specifically if people naturally infected with COVID-19 had a lower risk of contracting the virus than those who received the vaccine . He declined to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t have a really firm answer for you on that , ” Fauci said . “ That ’ s something that we ’ re going to have to discuss regarding the durability of the response. ” @ andersoncooper and I spoke with Dr. Fauci tonight . He tells us how he thinks @ POTUS plans could have gone further and that we need to better understand the durability of protection from natural infection . pic.twitter.com/I7PcPUo35s “ Based on the solid evidence from the Israeli study , the COVID recovered have stronger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated , ” Kulldorff wrote . “ Hence , there is no reason to prevent them from activities that are permitted to the vaccinated. ” Getting vaccinated after getting COVID-19 might provide additional protection . “ Recent research , ” the Mayo Clinic says , “ suggests that people who got COVID-19 in 2020 and then received mRNA vaccines produce very high levels of antibodies that are likely effective against current and , possibly , future variants . Some scientists call this hybrid immunity. ” Kulldorff is right , however , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with natural immunity differently than those who ’ ve been vaccinated . ( Vaccine passports themselves are morally dubious , as noted above , since they deprive individuals of fundamental freedoms . ) Moreover , Kulldorff says the NCAA ’ s decision to consider those who ’ ve had COVID “ fully vaccinated ” for just three months — a smaller window than those who ’ ve received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines — is strange since evidence indicates that natural immunity offers stronger protections against COVID than the vaccines . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural immunity for those who have recovered from COVID , but , since natural immunity is stronger and longer lasting than vaccine induced immunity , there are no public health reasons to only acknowledge it for three months after infection , ” Kulldorff , an epidemiologist and biostatistician who has studied infectious disease outbreaks for years , told me in an email . Still , while Dr. Fauci may not have made up his mind on natural immunity yet , it ’ s clear that other organizations are reaching their own conclusions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contain COVID-19 continue to fail . “ The omicron variant has presented another surge of cases across the country , ” NCAA chief medical officer Brian Hainline said . “ Given how the pandemic continues to evolve , it ’ s important that staff on member campuses continue to work with their local and state health officials on protocols most suitable for their locations. ” It ’ s unclear precisely what Hainline meant with these comments , but his use of the terms “ local and state health officials ” may reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ there ’ s no federal solution ” to the pandemic .

""""""" Almost exactly a month ago , I asked in this space whether the criminal case in New York against ex-president Donald Trump was on the verge of falling apart . Then , it was reported that the two top prosecutors brought in specifically to run the criminal probe into whether Trump , his associates and businesses were involved in illegal practices had abruptly quit . Why did they quit ? Because after years of work , Bragg stepped in and halted interviews before the grand jury that will ultimately decide whether or not Trump is charged . Bragg , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case would end in a conviction , despite the fact that a ) his predecessor , former Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance aggressively pursued the case ; and b ) New York grand juries exist only to determine whether there ’ s enough evidence to bring a case to trial , not to determine the likelihood of a conviction , which is what trial juries are for . We ’ ll come back to that last point in a bit , but for now , new reporting explains exactly why the two lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough at Bragg ( who is coincidentally one of two Black prosecutors in New York whose offices are investigating Trump , the other being U.S. Attorney Letitia James ) to walk off the job . The Times got hold of Mark Pomerantz ’ s , one of the frustrated prosecutors , resignation letter to Bragg , and he calls bullshit on the idea that Bragg should have lost confidence in the case . Trump , Pomerantz says , is absolutely guilty of multiple felonies , and his investigation unearthed more than enough evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the senior Manhattan prosecutors who investigated Donald J. Trump believed that the former president was “ guilty of numerous felony violations ” and that it was “ a grave failure of justice ” not to hold him accountable , according to a copy of his resignation letter… Mr. Pomerantz ’ s Feb. 23 letter , obtained by The New York Times , offers a personal account of his decision to resign and for the first time states explicitly his belief that the office could have convicted the former president . Mr. Bragg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public interest , ” he wrote . “ The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes — he did , ” Mr. Pomerantz wrote . Of course , just because Pomerantz believes in Trump ’ s guilt doesn ’ t mean he ’ d actually be found guilty . Bragg may be right in thinking that Trump wouldn ’ t be convicted at trial . There ’ s a saying among criminal attorneys that , ‘ you can indict a ham sandwich , ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower the evidentiary standard is to get a grand jury to charge someone ( they only require enough evidence there ’ s probable cause to hold a trial ) than it is to get a trial jury to convict ( they require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that someone is actually guilty ) . Which brings us back to the earlier point about grand juries : Because of that distinction , and because New York prosecutors use grand juries to bring the accused to trial all the time , there ’ s no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases in his career where the grand jury returned charges but the defendants were acquitted at trial . To paraphrase Cam ’ ron ’ s Rico character from the 2002 flick , Paid in Full , niggas get charged everyday , B. That ’ s exactly what trials are for , and why it ’ s usually suspect , for example , when prosecutors put evidence against killer cops into grand juries but fail to land on criminal charges . You almost have to be not trying for a grand jury to not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won on weak evidence don ’ t usually stop prosecutors from either putting people on trial or locking them up . Case in point : Kalief Browder , who killed himself after spending three years in New York ’ s Rikers Island jail only to have charges against him dropped without a trial , was sent to Rikers in the first place because prosecutors took a weak case against him to a Bronx County grand jury , which charged him with second-degree robbery . It ’ s probably the most infamous case that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which passed in 2019 . It ’ s worth noting here that Bragg , Manhattan ’ s first Black DA , has been accused of being too reform minded for his efforts to make the criminal justice system more fair . But the apparent course reversal on Trump begs a question that deserves Bragg ’ s public answer : If ordinary people like Browder can be subject to the grinding apparatus of New York ’ s criminal justice system on slim evidence , why can ’ t Trump face the same when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods for a conviction ?

"At New York University School of Law, the president of the student bar association drew swift rebuke Tuesday after writing in the association’s newsletter to “not condemn Palestinian resistance.” “This week, I want to express, first and foremost, my unwavering and absolute solidarity with Palestinians in their resistance against oppression toward liberation and self-determination,” Ryna Workman wrote in a newsletter message. “Israel bears full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life.” The missive — which was shared widely across X, the platform formerly known as Twitter — was met with scores of outraged comments from leaders, advocates and lawmakers."
"A week could be a very long time in Polish politics as progressive forces unite to challenge the eight-year dominance of the conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) in high-stakes parliamentary elections scheduled for Sunday, October 15th. While Warsaw has been a thorn in the side of Eurocrats for years, the powers that be are pulling out all the stops to secure victory for Brussels’ favoured candidate Donald Tusk and his Civic Coalition party (KO). This comes as PiS faces an additional challenge from NATO-critical populists in the form of the Konfederacja party, which has gained significant support from the younger generation on the right. So, is the end nigh for conservative rule in Warsaw, or is PiS just facing a minor speed bump ahead of a wider shift to the right at the European level? To get insight into this and broader issues in Polish politics, The European Conservative spoke to Sébastien Meuwissen, communications director of the conservative Polish think-tank Ordo Iuris, less than a week before polling day."

"The Republican Party in the United States has moved farther right in recent years. And as it’s done so, you would think racialized Americans might be distancing themselves from it and its policies. But at last week’s GOP primary presidential debates, three of the seven people on stage were candidates of colour. Racialized citizens also have been drawn to far-right politics, including key players in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the United States Capitol and recent racist attacks. Which begs the question: Why are racialized people upholding white supremacist ideologies that work against them?"
"(The following story is being told here in print for the first time. Originally prepared as a chapter in my book, Evangelical and Methodist A Popular History, Abingdon, 2004, it was not used in the interests of brevity.) In the Fall of 1972 Charles Keysor, editor of Good News magazine, Phil Hinerman, who was chair of the Good News board at the time, and I gathered in Elkhart, Indiana, to meet with Mr. Ernest Sims. A wealthy layman from Trinity Church, Elkhart, Sims was a former president of Circuit Riders, a conservative activist group that had been organized in 1951, “to oppose all efforts to propagate Socialism and Communism and all other anti-American teachings in the Methodist Church.” Circuit Riders was the main force behind a resolution at the 1952 General Conference condemning the Methodist Federation for Social Action and for legislation which added to the Social Creed a statement which acknowledged “the principle of the acquisition of property by Christian processes, and in the right of private ownership thereof.” Though it seems strange in retrospect, Methodist social policy to that time had been so closely aligned with socialist ideology that the statement affirming the right of private property seemed a major breakthrough for economic conservatives."

"The World Transformed (TWT) has released what it calls a “combative” programme for this year’s left-wing political festival of ideas. It will coincide with the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, which TWT is looking to counter with a line up of events and speakers it is calling “the real opposition”. With groups like Extinction Rebellion (XR) attending, it will be awkward for Keir Starmer – not least because XR activists have literally just repainted his party HQ with fake oil. TWT: the real opposition? TWT is running from 7 to 10 October. As it has before, the yearly programme of culture and politics will again run alongside the Labour conference. However, it has come to contrast starkly with the party’s now right-wing policy platform."

He referred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Internet as a “ paranoid narrative ” : According to Roth , in the discussions surrounding youth protection on apps like Grindr , it was rarely acknowledged “ that the new medium of gay-targeted social networking may be a crucial social outlet for gay , bisexual , and questioning youth. ” “ While gay youth-oriented chat rooms and social networking services were available in the early 2000s , these services have largely fallen by the wayside , in favor of general-purpose platforms like Twitter , Facebook , and Snapchat , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly representative of an increasingly absent demand among young adults for networked spaces to engage with peers about their sexuality ; but it ’ s worth considering how , if at all , the current generation of popular sites of gay networked sociability might fit into an overall queer social landscape that increasingly includes individuals under the age of 18. ” While Roth admitted that Grindr may be “ too lewd ” and “ too hook-up-oriented ” for minors , he argued that teenagers should not be excluded from the platform , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connecting queer young adults ” : Even with the service ’ s extensive content management , Grindr may well be too lewd or too hook-up-oriented to be a safe and age-appropriate resource for teenagers ; but the fact that people under 18 are on these services already indicates that we can ’ t readily dismiss these platforms out of hand as loci for queer youth culture .

""""""" If at first you don ’ t succeed , then try , try again . This seems to be the mantra of the Ukrainian government as it seeks to blackmail the international community into helping it evict Russia from the territory encompassing Europe ’ s largest Nuclear Power Plant . “ The world is once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster , ” Kiev ’ s Energy Secretary German Galushchenko declared in a message posted to Facebook on Monday , September 5 . “ The last line connecting it with the energy system of Ukraine…separated due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelling . Any repair of the lines is impossible now – there are combat operations around the station. ” Galushchenko ’ s warning came as the bulk of an International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) mission , dispatched late last week to inspect the safety of the Zaporozhye facility , and personally led by Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi , departed the nuclear power plant . Kiev is insisting that the international community oversee the “ demilitarization ” of the Zaporozhye plant and surrounding environs . The removal of Russian forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with international “ peacekeepers , ” is the only way to ensure nuclear safety . Left unsaid is the fact that all the damage caused to the nuclear power plant is the result of Ukrainian military action , including the deliberate targeting of the nuclear reactors and their support buildings by Ukrainian artillery . The irony of the Ukrainian action is that IAEA Director General Grossi has now seen first-hand that the threat to the plant comes not from Russia , as Kiev wants to portray , but from Ukraine itself . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reality that Ukraine has been using the IAEA not as a guarantor of nuclear security , but rather a facilitator of Ukrainian policy , including military action that appeared to use the presence of IAEA inspectors at Zaporozhye as cover . By all appearances , Grossi undertook his mission to the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant in good faith . Since the attacks on the facility started in early August , he has been voicing his concerns and calling on forces on both sides to exercise the “ utmost restraint ” and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ at all costs. ” These calls were echoed by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres . In mid-August , at an emergency session of the UN Security Council requested by Russia , Grossi called on Moscow and Kiev allow international experts to visit the power plant , and said he ’ d lead the mission himself . The United States , while backing his call , also demanded that a demilitarized zone be established in conjunction with any such visit , and said that any refusal by Russia to allow that was tantamount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider any requests to “ demilitarize ” the facility . It did , however , encourage the dispatch of the IAEA team , with one caveat – that it include ballistics specialists who would be able to evaluate the damage done to the plant with an eye toward determining the source of the attacks . Such professionals were included in the mission . On August 29 , Grossi ’ s team travelled to Kiev , where the next day they met with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky . Zelensky told Grossi that Ukraine believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press home its demands for a demilitarized zone , which would enable Ukraine to take control of the plant . On September 1 , Grossi and his team set off for the Zaporozhye facility . Prior to their arrival , they were stopped by Ukrainian officials , who warned Grossi that military activity in and around the facility had picked up that morning . According to Russian military sources , the Ukrainian army had attempted to seize the power plant in a commando raid that was thwarted by Russian forces . As Grossi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power plant , the sound of nearby combat could be readily heard . The deteriorating security situation at the facility prompted Grossi to withdraw the bulk of his team later that day . A six-person sub-team was tasked with remaining on-site for a few days longer , after which four inspectors would depart , leaving behind a two-person element , who would provide a permanent presence , on a rotational basis , at the facility . Afterwards , Grossi stated that the mission had been valuable . “ We knew a lot before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being inspected now . We are trying to do a thorough assessment of the current situation. ” As to the security of the plant , Grossi noted that “ [ t ] he physical integrity of the facility has been violated not once , but multiple times . This is by no means acceptable. ” In addition to their personal observations , the team was presented with a petition signed by 20,000 residents from Russia-controlled parts of the Zaporozhye region demanding that the IAEA condemn the attacks on the nuclear power plant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Ukrainian forces . This was not the result either the Ukrainian government or its Western backers could have envisioned when they were pushing for the mission ’ s dispatch in mid- to late-August . The IAEA mission , it seems , was not aware that there was going to be a Ukrainian military operation designed to capture the site while the inspectors were en route . There can be no doubt , however , that the Ukrainian government was aware that this was going to happen , even as Zelensky met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . It is also highly likely that Zelensky ’ s backers , especially the United States , United Kingdom , and France , were aware of the pending military operation , if not its timing . Needless to say , using an international inspection team as cover for a military operation is a violation of everything the United Nations Charter stands for . While the goal of the operation appears to have been to capture the site , and then invite the IAEA inspectors to remain there permanently , prompting the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , this was not achieved . Worse still for Ukraine and its partners , the team has now been exposed to the duplicity of the Ukrainian government and , by extension , its Western backers in the United Nations , as well as to the reality that Russia had been telling the truth the entire time about the safety and security of the plant . There is no doubt that the ballistic experts accompanying Grossi ’ s team were able to gather more than enough forensic data to prove conclusively who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Tuesday , September 6 , Director General Grossi submitted the findings of his mission as part of a larger periodic report on the IAEA ’ s work in Ukraine since the initiation of Russia ’ s special military operation . The report is technical in nature , focusing on the safety of the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant . This is the IAEA ’ s bread and butter , and based upon the contents of the report , the team accurately reflected what it observed while on the ground in Zaporozhye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive aspect of the report is the political ramifications of the mission . While accurately reporting the frequency and damage done by repeated artillery strikes on the territory of the plant , Grossi did not provide any conclusions about the origin of the shelling , despite being able to do so based on the data collected by his team . UN organizations , unless specifically mandated to do so , rarely provide attribution when it comes to who did what to whom . Instead , the report concluded that the safety and security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators has been put at risk because of the ongoing military action , and encouraged all parties involved to cease such activity . The report likewise avoids any reference to the efforts of the Russian military to keep the team safe from attack while they were visiting the plant , thereby avoiding any indirect acknowledgement that the threat to Zaporozhye came from Ukraine , not Russia . What the team did do is speak of “ an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved by the immediate establishment of a “ nuclear safety and security protection zone. ” Grossi declared that the “ IAEA is ready to start immediately the consultations leading to the urgent establishment of such a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the ZNPP [ Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant ] . ” Grossi could have prepared a report that sought the UN Security Council ’ s condemnation of the perpetrators of the egregious actions observed by the IAEA team – evidence of ongoing Ukrainian artillery attacks , and the use of Grossi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physical attack on the plant while the mission was underway . Grossi is part of the UN system , however , and in any event the Council can not police itself ; when three of the five permanent members are involved in facilitating the Ukrainian malfeasance , then the Council is paralyzed by its own moral corruption . Regardless , Grossi ’ s trip is a political defeat for Ukraine and its supporters , which had placed so much hope and effort ( including the lives of soldiers who perished in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the IAEA inspection as a facilitator for larger objectives , such as the dispatch of international peacekeepers to occupy the plant and its immediate environs . In a crass display of hubris-laced audacity , Ukraine has called for a new IAEA inspection mission to be accompanied by a UN peacekeeping force . “ We need to draw conclusions from this mission { Grossi ’ s } on the ground , ” Peter Kotin , the head of Energoatom , declared on September 5 , 2022 – well prior to Grossi ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should resolve the whole situation by ending Russian control . If the mission does not produce that , then we must have some viable outcome. ” Kotin proposed increasing the number of agency inspectors at the station , adding that “ the presence of other international organizations , such as United Nations peacekeeping forces or other international missions from the European Union , will help provide an independent view of what is going on there , and ultimately remove the Russians from the station. ” The chances of that happening are near zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push for this outcome virtually guarantees that the relentless shelling of the Zaporozhye plant will continue until such time as the Ukrainian military is pushed back , out of artillery range , or else Ukraine capitulates . In any event , the world will continue to be subjected to nuclear blackmail daily . The perpetrator of this global crime , however , isn ’ t Russia , but rather Ukraine , along with its Western supporters in the United States , United Kingdom , France , Germany , and elsewhere .

The analysis , “ Never Too Early to Prepare For Next Winter : Europe ’ s Gas Balance for 2023-24 , ” highlighted the need for urgent action by governments to reduce consumption amid the global energy crisis .

The IEA warned that the process of filling storage sites this year benefitted from key factors that may not be repeated in 2023 , including Russian pipeline gas deliveries that , although cut sharply during 2022 , were close to “ normal ” levels for much of the first half of the year . Total pipeline supply from Russia to the EU in 2022 is likely to amount to around 60 bcm , but it is highly unlikely that Russia will deliver another 60 bcm of pipeline gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe could halt completely , according to the analysis . Europe has secured enough gas to get through the winter months , however , consumer prices have soared , and questions remain on how Europe will fill its stores next year , and for the impact of the ongoing energy crisis on poorer countries that have largely been shut out of the natural gas market due to the increased demand of western nations .

Other countries that once refused to develop national nuclear power plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is divided on nuclear energy . Though nuclear energy recognized as an affordable , stable , clean and independent energy source that could provide Europe with greater energy security , Lithuania feels being thrown overboard the European nuclear power industry . The matter is Lithuania agreed to close the plant as part of its accession agreement to the European Union .

Enough people did notify police that they eventually put out a brief statement : Preliminary findings indicate that the woman reported by netizens is Yang *xia [ asterisk indicates the use of a “ filler character ” to obscure the full name ] , who legally married Dong *min in Huankou Township , Feng County , in August of 1998 . There is no evidence of trafficking . Relatives and neighbors report frequent unprovoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly . A medical institution diagnosed Yang as suffering from mental illness , for which she is currently receiving treatment . People didn ’ t buy that explanation . One person responded , “ Hello , what ’ s going on with that metal chain ? If she ’ s mentally ill , wouldn ’ t they call the police and get her transferred to a mental hospital ? And what , just because they ’ re married , he ’ s allowed to keep her in chains ? ” So local authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yang *xia ( whose name was provided to investigators by her husband Dong *min ) was living as a vagrant beggar in the border region between Huankou Township , Jiangsu , and Yutai County , Shandong , when she was found and taken in by Dong *min ’ s father , Dong *geng ( now deceased ) in June of 1998 , after which she lived with Dong *min . In the process of living together , Yang was discovered to be developmentally disabled , but she was still able to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yang ’ s condition has worsened . When her mental illness flares up , she often smashes things and beats her children and elderly family members . In order to prevent his wife from harming others when her illness manifests , Dong temporarily uses shackles and chains to restrain her from this behavior , but removes them after her mental state stabilizes . Dong ’ s actions are suspected of being in violation of the law , and the police have launched an investigation into him . Despite the official denials , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of trafficking which is apparently more common in China than authorities want to admit . A woman who was sold by her uncle at the age of 12 , wrote about her experience and connected it to the woman in chains . In 2000 , when I was 12 years old , my uncle sold me to an older male student named Chen . When my uncle sold me , all the village cadres participated : they even personally wrote and signed the contract between the uncle who trafficked me and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I was 13 years old , Chen took me to work in Fujian . During this period , I was raped . I reported it to the police and went to the police station to make a statement . My uncle bribed the chief of the police station with some eggs , roosters , bacon and pigs feet … after that , the matter was covered up and the chief refused to allow the police to investigate further… So when I say that the village committee , town government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yang ’ s situation ] , it ’ s because I ’ ve experienced it personally ! They don ’ t care at all , because they don ’ t want to care ! There are communist party cadres in every town who are there to monitor what is going on . But if they ’ ve been bribed to turn a blind eye , they ’ ll do that . So there ’ s really no telling what the true story is about this woman . The local officials can ’ t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past 25 years so they ’ re heavily incentivized deny it . In fact , there ’ s a report from Deutsche Welle that after the official statement came out saying there was no evidence of trafficking , social media users can no longer use the word in reference to this case . Anyone who does has to be prepared to “ receive a call from the police , using information about their parents and employers to threaten them . ” """""""
""""""" Shipping containers , some marked `` China Shipping , '' are stacked at the Port of Los Angeles , Calif. , on Nov. 7 , 2019 . ( Mario Tama/Getty Images ) Senators Ask Biden to Maintain China Tariffs Imposed by Trump A group of bipartisan senators have written a letter to President Joe Biden asking that he maintain the tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by the Trump administration . The senators , led by Republican Rob Portman , point out that the United States had imposed tariffs on $ 370 billion worth of Chinese goods in response to Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” the May 25 letter states . This includes forcing U.S. companies to enter into joint ventures with local firms in order to conduct business in China , forcing foreign companies to license technologies to Chinese firms at terms beneficial to the latter , stealing American intellectual property , intruding into U.S. computer networks , and so on . “ Rolling back the tariffs on China would undermine the U.S. position in negotiations , expose many U.S. companies and workers to a sudden flood of imports , and signal to China that waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing their non-market behavior or complying with the Phase One Agreement , ” the letter said . In his recent trip to Asia , the president admitted that he was weighing cutting tariffs on Chinese goods . The Phase One Agreement signed by Washington and Beijing on Jan. 15 , 2020 , required China to buy an extra $ 200 billion of U.S. goods and services over the 2017 annual purchase of $ 151.2 billion . Two years after signing the deal , China did not even get close to the targeted purchases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute for International Economics ( PIIE ) , China was obligated to buy $ 227.9 billion worth of American exports in 2020 and $ 274.5 billion in 2021 for a total of $ 502.4 billion . However , China only bought $ 286.6 billion worth of U.S. goods and services in the two years , 57 percent of the $ 502.4 billion commitment . In the letter , the senators stated that the tariffs helped Washington negotiate the phase one deal with Beijing . And yet , China continues to engage in “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field away from American companies and workers to the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party . In addition , Beijing continues with its human rights violations in Xinjiang and Hong Kong while becoming a strong ally of Russia as it attacks Ukraine , the letter noted . Given such “ realities , ” the senators argued that it would be “ counterproductive ” to lift tariffs on Chinese goods in hopes that Beijing will “ somehow become more cooperative ” on other issues . Rather than lift tariffs , Washington must enforce tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Beijing that it is “ serious ” about rectifying violations of the Phase One commitment . “ If we do not exercise the legal rights under the Phase One Agreement , it will only make it more difficult to make progress with China on the subsidies , state-owned enterprises , suppression of labor rights , and other unfair behaviors that are the core of the structural obstacles to a level playing field in bilateral trade , ” the letter warned . Senators also dismissed claims that the tariffs are driving up inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current inflation by more than three years and that Chinese imports only account for 2 percent of the goods included in the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) used to measure inflation .

""""""" NEW ORLEANS -- A Black man wrongfully convicted as a teenager for a New Orleans rape more than 36 years ago was ordered freed Thursday after a judge threw out his conviction . Sullivan Walter , now 53 , used a handkerchief to wipe away tears as a state district judge formally vacated his conviction for a home-invasion rape . Judge Darryl Derbigny expressed anger that blood and semen evidence that could have cleared him never made it to to the jury . “ To say this was unconscionable is an understatement , ” Derbigny told Walter . Walter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He first had to be taken back to the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in St. Gabriel to be processed out . District Attorney Jason Williams ' office joined with defense attorneys working with Innocence Project New Orleans , a criminal justice advocacy group , to have the conviction vacated . Walter was 17 when he was arrested in connection with the New Orleans rape . The rapist had entered the home of the victim , identified in the record as L.S. , in May 1986 , held a knife to her throat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who slept through the incident . Emily Maw , an attorney with Williams ’ office , outlined the problems in the case in court , noting there were reasons to believe the victim , the only witness , had mistakenly identified Walter . “ There were some red flags that the eyewitness testimony could well have been unreliable , ” Maw told Derbigny . Those “ red flags ” had been spelled out in a joint filing by the defense and prosecutors ahead of Thursday 's hearing . “ In this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cross-racial identification of someone who at all the times that she could observe him was either masked , in an unlit room at night , and/or threatening her not to look at him . In addition , L.S . was not shown a photo array containing Mr. Walter until over six weeks after the crime , '' the motion said . More significantly , no evidence was presented about Walter 's blood characteristics that did not match the semen collected from the victim after the rape . The filing also recounts years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorneys , including failing to point out conflicting statements by a police officer who worked on the case and missteps during the appeal process regarding the blood and semen evidence . When he was cleared Thursday , Walter had been serving a total sentence of 39 years — four for a burglary charge unrelated to the rape case , and 35 years for multiple charges in the rape case . Attorneys said the victim in the rape is now deceased . Maw said in court that authorities had reached out to the victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he had expressed regret on behalf of his mother about the wrongful conviction . Innocence Project New Orleans Legal Director Richard Davis said Walter 's race was a factor in the wrongful conviction . “ The lawyers and law enforcement involved acted as if they believed that they could do what they chose to a Black teenager from a poor family and would never be scrutinized or held to account , ” Davis said in a written statement . `` This is not just about individuals and their choices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ” """""""
