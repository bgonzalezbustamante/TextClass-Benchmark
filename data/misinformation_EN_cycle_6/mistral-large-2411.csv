""""""" The US has reportedly used a secretive authority called ‘ 127e ’ to launch at least two dozen proxy wars since 2017 , according to an article published on Friday by The Intercept . The outlet claims to have obtained never-before-seen documents and spoken to top officials with intimate knowledge of these programs . The Intercept received the documents through the Freedom of Information Act , claiming these papers are the first ever official confirmation that at least 14 so-called ‘ 127e programs ’ were active in the greater Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions as recently as 2020 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate 127e programs across the globe between 2017 and 2020 , which cost US taxpayers $ 310 million . The Intercept explains that 127e is one of several virtually unknown authorities granted to the Department of Defense by Congress over the last two decades .

The program allows the US to arm , train , and provide intelligence to foreign forces . However , unlike traditional foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up local capacity in partner countries , 127e “ surrogate forces ” are expected to follow US orders and conduct Washington-directed missions against US enemies to achieve American goals , essentially serving as the Pentagon ’ s proxy armies .

""""""" I don ’ t necessarily like to do so-called ‘ annual prediction ’ posts . Having written a ton of them for the newsletters I ’ ve written over the years , looking back on them is always a bit cringe-inducing . But 2021 was a crazy year and one where so much happened that changed the landscape it looks like one of those necessary evils for 2022 . In fact , I may wind up doing more than I normally do . After being on Bitcoin Magazine ’ s Fed Watch podcast in December , I was asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It just dropped over there . IS 2022 THE YEAR BITCOIN PROVES ITSELF ON THE WORLD STAGE ? It was a fascinating year for cryptos . One in which no matter how hard I tried , I couldn ’ t keep up with everything that happened . Going to Bitcoin 2021 in Miami and seeing the clash of OG bitcoiners with the gold rush mentality of the industry it reminded me of the best of times at your typical precious metals conference . Hey , even Ron Paul was there , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , 2021 was as strange as any year I ’ ve ever experienced . The real clash wasn ’ t in the various crypto fiefdoms per se , but what the emergence of crypto as a full-fledged investible asset class meant that grabbed and held my attention all year . It was beyond the regular bull market mentality that morphed into mania by mid-year . It was the realization that bitcoin and crypto would begin asserting its potential as a safe-haven asset that was finally proven to more than just us fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses from what Michael Malice calls The Cathedral and what I call The Davos Crowd is what the real story was in 2021 . Capital inflow to cryptocurrency grew as China forced out mining and sent that capacity to the U.S . Global economic disruptions thanks to COVID-19 forced radical rethinking of energy policy . Bitcoin was finally exposed as uneconomic subsidized electricity rates in China , for example . So , given this immense growth in the public mindshare in 2021 , the title seems a moot question at first blush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . But 2021 was just the warm-up act for the real economic showdown in 2022 between the Great Powers . The old system is clearly failing . It is the way it fails which will inform geopolitical tensions worldwide . These will take center stage as the titans of that old financial and political order fight for dominance over a shrinking pile of capital . In the middle , bitcoin stands ready to perform the vital role of intermediary and escape valve for potentially trillions in capital seeking a safe haven from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very obvious that Davos is scared to death of not having control over the outcome of this story . Lock it Down , Tune it Up I spent most of 2021 making the argument that despite the endless procession of headlines and edicts from Davos and its quislings in decision-making positions all across the West , they were making big gains but leaving themselves more exposed to counterattack than they ever have before . From ridiculous lockdowns to vaccine mandates it was clear that what we were watching was a pre-planned script of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrage of micromanaging public opinion via complicit media , stoking fear to create division to rob people of something far worse than their reason , their reason for living . But as the year went along the truth about COVID-9/11 , the efficacy of masks and the intimidation of the medical industry reached a peak . No matter how much more they squeezed , there was a large enough percentage of people all across the world who simply said , “ You know what ? No. ” No masks . No jab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No . A thousand times , No . Because when anyone resorts to the level of bullying , bribing , coercing and lying that these people have engaged in it reveals just how shallow their power truly is . And it ’ s plain as day to anyone whose mind is still free . Too many see this story for what it is , a story for this thing to be successful . A bad horror movie meant to keep the weak and the indebted in a constant fight or flight response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says , “ What in the actual hell are you talking about ? ” At some point in every scam the mark confronts the scammer and the scammer then has a choice . Double down or run . Davos still thinks they can double down . Dr. Fauci now thinks he can go out and tell the truth out loud and still have credibility . But those with real credibility just speak the truth once and the narrative collapses : Mark Jeftovic noted what I said weeks ago : Omicron would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you step back and think about the Davos narrative over COVID you realize that this is a plan that says trust the people in charge while also destroying your faith in them . For the hyper-normal , skewering their statist religion will spur them to new heights of violence rather than face their shame . Eventually , people just get tired of being jerked around by an invisible chain held by blue-checkmarked NPCs on Twitter and tune into the very people , mRNA vaccine developer Robert Malone , they were told they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told you when he signed the big Spotify deal that Joe Rogan would blow up Davos ’ Death Star . Lies are expensive . The truth sells itself . Because , eventually , there is a limit to threatening people for disobeying . Eventually people call the bluff . COVID-9/11 was simply a means to an end . That end is nothing less than a reset of an immoral financial architecture that has squandered the capital and heritage of the entire West in the vain hope of salvaging the power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davos sold the Great Reset to that old money and the politicians to save their privilege they would have to fully destroy everything else , namely their subjects , and Build it Back Better . It was badly premised on the idea that Communism would have worked if only the U.S. and Europe had joined Mao and Stalin during the last major cycle . It was never going to work . There ’ s too much wealth in the world to pull that off and technology is advancing too rapidly for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage versus theirs . So , today we are witness to the willful destruction of some of the oldest cultures in the West , purposefully impoverishing hundreds of millions while simultaneously poisoning them to cull the herd of the unwanted . While we in control group of their grand experiment continue sitting back with our arms crossed saying , “ No. ” They get weaker . We get stronger . What happens in 2022 is Davos getting their plans implemented in a rough patchwork of tyranny . They ’ ll take the wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , California , Canada , Australia , etc . — and hope it is enough to keep the program moving forward . But having exposed themselves this badly those that have refused to date will not be bowed . They have nothing left to lose . And the costs of enforcement of this plan are rising too rapidly for it to be maintained . Bitcoin Fixed Some of This , Too This is why I think 2021 wasn ’ t Bitcoin ’ s year . 2022 is . 2022 is the year that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in capital flee the chaos as Davos splinters , their control over important nodes of economic dynamism slips further and the people have the choice put in front of them clearly . Your keys , your money . Their keys , your servitude . Because we ’ ve reached that proverbial crossroads in time where more beatings ensures morale never improves , instead it hardens into something cold and implacable . As those places most under Davos ’ control sink into ever-widening gyres of madness , the capital flight from them will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly a hundred years . No amount of arm-twisting and rule changes will hold back this tidal outflow . It ’ s already begun . Capital is like water . And if Europeans are forbidden from moving their money out through normal means , buying property in Florida is always a good bet , then they will use whatever is at hand . Crypto is definitely one of those escape valves , it ’ s the thing that ECB President Christine Lagarde fears more than anything else . So , for my 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following : Bitcoin , along with gold , will assert themselves as the premier custodial assets for a world in chaos . Debt will become the dirtiest word in the English language over this period of history . The trade in both gold and crypto will be volatile and choppy as day-to-day U.S. dollar funding needs will create false moves up and down . The Fed will defend the dollar . Bitcoin will peak and likely fall later in the year as the crisis in Europe reaches its zenith and the four-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a titanic fight . But the early trend will be the same as 2021 , up . During the height of the crisis that emerges , bitcoin should be the premier asset of choice which investors flee into . The groundwork for this capacity was laid in 2021 . 2022 is the year it gets utilized . For capital that can ’ t move into bitcoin and for central banks who need to diversify reserves , gold will remain their asset of choice . Gold will play catchup in 2022 to bitcoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is treated best . And despite the volatility , there are fewer places on earth that have the capacity to treat capital better today than Bitcoin . Join my Patreon if you like saying No . """"""",0

"“Today, more than 50 Democratic members of the Texas House left Austin…not because we want to — it breaks our heart that we have to do it — but we do it because we are in a fight to save our democracy. The nationwide Republican voter suppression efforts are coming to a crisis point in the state of Texas right now.” These remarks came from the former Chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, Chris Turner (D-Grand Prairie), who joined his colleagues in a July 2021 exodus to Washington D.C. that was motivated by Senate Bill 1, state Republicans’ omnibus voter suppression package. Turner and his fellow lawmakers fled to the nation’s capital during a special legislative session with a specific goal: stymie the legislation by breaking quorum — the minimum number of legislators needed to hold a vote — and prevent S.B. 1’s sweeping anti-voting measures from becoming law. Indeed, this was not the first time Democratic legislators deployed drastic measures in opposition to S.B. 1’s voting restrictions that disproportionately target minority voters and voters with disabilities. At the conclusion of the state’s regular legislative session back in May 2021, House Democrats prevailed in blocking the enactment of a previous iteration of the legislation after staging a coordinated walk-out that denied Republicans the quorum needed to conduct business.",0

"You’ve probably heard the news about the latest scandal involving one of the GOP’s MAGA stars, a camera-hungry firebrand by the name of Lauren Boebert, a congresswoman from Colorado. To recap: Boebert was recently with her boyfriend at a family-friendly Beetlejuice concert where she was vaping, yelling loudly, taking photos and, the topper, groping her boyfriend’s genitals. When a pregnant woman behind Boebert asked her to sit down and be quiet, Boebert called her a “sad and miserable person.” When she was asked to leave, Boebert resisted asking, “Do you know who I am?” She was ultimately forced to leave, but not before giving the finger to security guards. Incidentally, Boebert kept lying about what occurred at the concert, but she had to come clean after video cameras exposed her lies. Boebert, mind you, is a mother of four boys who brands herself as a devout Christian, a proud American who fights to uphold conservative family values. And, no surprise, she’s fiercely loyal to her role model Donald Trump, a fellow firebrand who calls himself a “Christian” and has bragged that he can freely grab the genitals of a member of the opposite sex.",1
"Photo: AP Photo/Alex Slitz/AP There are two stories being told in Georgia lately. In one, the state is under siege by violent left-wing militants who threaten public safety by fighting the construction of “Cop City,” an elaborate police training facility, in the forest near Atlanta. So claims a broad new RICO indictment released this week by the state’s attorney general, Chris Carr. In the indictment’s telling, 61 violent conspirators deserve prison for acts of vandalism and “intimidation.” That story appeals to state and local officials in both parties. After the indictment was unsealed, the state’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, said his “priority” was to “keep Georgians safe, especially against out-of-state radicals that threaten the safety of our citizens and law enforcement.” The “radicals” have their own story to tell, about the abuse of power. In their account, the RICO indictment escalates a long-running crackdown on activism. This is not the first time the state has tried to frighten people away from the movement against Cop City. Some accused face previous domestic terrorism charges. Others had been arrested in connection to earlier protests. In March, more than 150 protesters chased police from a construction site and allegedly set construction equipment on fire before blending in with the crowd at a peaceful anti–Cop City concert nearby. The state arrested dozens, including a legal observer, for domestic terrorism “even though none of the warrants accuses any of them of injuring anyone or vandalizing anything,” the Associated Press reported. Police profiled individuals for wearing muddy shoes and clothing. Months earlier, they killed an activist in alleged self-defense during an attempt to clear the forest.",0

These tubes are formed by the curled lower portion of the grass leaf , called the sheath , which represents something of an evolutionary triumph .

The elections were conducted under less than ideal circumstances, but, in a sense, they were “good enough” to allow popular will to prevail. “Poland’s parliamentary elections were characterized by record-high voter participation with a wide choice of political options and candidates able to campaign freely, but the campaign was tarnished by notable overlap between the ruling party’s messages and government information campaigns,” the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said. “Together with distorted and openly partisan coverage by the public broadcaster, this provided a clear advantage to the ruling party, undermining the democratic separation of state and party.” Yet with all those hindrances, the governing regime could not “rig” the results.",0

When illegal border jumpers are nabbed , Customs and Border Protection is supposed to issue the migrant a Notice to Appear , which is a summons for immigration court . CBP is then supposed to file the NTA with the immigration court itself . But CBP failed to file the form in nearly 17 % of cases so far this fiscal year , according to data compiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syracuse University and released Friday .

""""""" • Former energy advisor Bob McNally once said , “ Few things terrify an American president more than a spike in fuel [ gasoline ] prices. ” • U.S. President Joe Biden is grappling with the task to bring down oil prices , but his options are limited . • Some are even speculating that Biden ’ s perceived inaction is fueled by a desire to make his renewable agenda seem more cost-competitive . U.S. presidents have long been made by their advisers to understand the dangers of benchmark oil prices staying above the US $ 75-80 per barrel ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . As the Brent and West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) benchmarks continue to spike back above that level – and threaten a sustained move even above US $ 90 pb – there will be renewed pressure on President Joe Biden to act to bring oil prices down to below the ‘ danger ’ levels . The danger for a U.S. president in oil prices being above these levels for any prolonged period is twofold . Firstly , there is the damage that is done to the U.S. economy . As analyzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global oil markets , and the recent disconnect between the oil and gas markets aside , historical precedent highlighted that every US $ 10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil results in a 25-30 cent change in the price of a gallon of gasoline . The corollary longstanding rule of thumb is that for every one cent that the U.S. ’ s average price of gasoline increases , more than US $ 1 billion per year in discretionary additional consumer spending is lost . Secondly , there is the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting U.S. president and his party by the negative economic effects of sustained high oil prices and also by the negative public reaction to sustained high gasoline prices . The ‘ danger zone ’ for U.S. presidents starts at around US $ 3.00 per gallon and at US $ 4.00 per gallon they are being advised to pack their bags in Pennsylvania Avenue or start a war to divert the public ’ s attention . The point was underlined by Bob McNally , the former energy adviser to the former President George W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things terrify an American president more than a spike in fuel [ gasoline ] prices. ” Specifically , as also analyzed in-depth in my new book on the global oil markets , it is a matter of historical fact that since World War I , the sitting U.S. president has won re-election 11 times out of 11 if the U.S. economy was not in recession within two years of an upcoming election . However , presidents who went into a re-election campaign with the economy in recession won only once out of seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although strictly speaking he had not won the previous election but had rather taken up the position on the death in office of Warren G Harding ) . Although President Biden is not facing another presidential election for four years , he does face critical mid-term elections within the next two years – November 2022 , in fact – when his Democrats could lose their narrow majority in the House of Representatives . There are those who say that Biden is content to see the prices of traditional fossil fuels rise in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their more costly ‘ green ’ alternatives . However , underlining how often and how quickly such lofty principles disappear in the cold light of hard political self-interest , the U.S. Land Administration Committee released data at the beginning of 2022 showing that Biden in his first year as president issued 35 percent more permits for drilling oil and gas wells than his predecessor , Donald Trump , in his first year . Given that there is evidently no ideological reason precluding Biden from acting against rising oil prices , what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so right now ? Some believe that taking the sort of robust approach to OPEC producers through its de facto leader , Saudi Arabia , would prompt a flood of new oil into the market . The regulation of oil prices in an effective band between a US $ 35-40 pb floor ( the breakeven price of U.S. shale producers ) and a US $ 75-80 pb cap ( the level above which the prospect of economic damage to the U.S. looms ) was a significant achievement of the Trump presidential era . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor price was easier to manipulate , as it was reached only when Saudi Arabia and OPEC were actively pumping everything they could – most notably during the 2020 Oil Price War – and could easily be reversed by cutting back production to more historically average levels . Forcing Saudi to do this was achieved by Trump directly telephoning Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ( MbS ) on 2 April 2020 and telling him that unless OPEC started cutting oil production he would be powerless to stop lawmakers from passing legislation to withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s administration was successful also in controlling the cap on the price through similar tactics , as evidenced during the only time that oil prices rose and stayed persistently above the US $ 75 per barrel of Brent level during his presidency – April to October 2019 . Trump publically Tweeted about Saudi Arabia ’ s King Salman that : “ He would not last in power for two weeks without the backing of the U.S. military. ” Privately , moves were being made to finally push through the ‘ No Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOPEC ) , the threat of which also hung over the mooted initial public offering of Saudi Aramco that was vital for MbS ’ s prestige among senior Saudis at the time . The NOPEC bill , when enacted , would immediately remove the sovereign immunity that exists in U.S. courts for OPEC as a group and for its individual member states . This would leave Saudi Arabia open to being sued under existing U.S. anti-trust legislation , with its total liability being it ’ s estimated US $ 1 trillion of investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aramco being broken up into constituent parts . So , would either of these tactics work right now for Biden ’ s administration ? Although genuine figures for the global oil market are difficult to ascertain , as seen most recently with export numbers for Iran and China and for even official International Energy Agency ( IEA ) numbers , the genuine oil production capacity and spare capacity numbers for OPEC ’ s principal producer , Saudi Arabia , are much lower than the official Saudi figures , as analyzed in-depth as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 – when Trump told MbS to start pumping more into the market – and now is that this deficit between genuine and imagined spare capacity is shared among a much wider range of OPEC oil producers than just Saudi . This is partly a consequence of originally exaggerated claims over oil reserves , production capacity , and spare capacity from some of the producers for geopolitical purposes and partly due to the negative effects on the oil industry ’ s financial and operational infrastructure because of the long-running COVID-19 pandemic . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 , clinically assessed as being less deadly than its predecessors for those with the necessary vaccinations against it , and the world economy likely to register a growth of over 4.5 percent this year , the IEA currently estimates that world oil demand will rise by 3.3 million barrels per day ( bpd ) in 2022 . This surpasses the pre-pandemic level of 99.7 million bpd in 2019 . In short , OPEC ’ s genuine spare capacity , and Russia ’ s as well as part of the ‘ OPEC+ ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of whatever inducements or threats Biden might use . In reality , this leaves the U.S. president with three options to bring oil prices down quickly . The first is to announce another drawdown of oil from the U.S. ’ s Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( SPR ) , and – vitally – an accompanying statement that further releases will be done as and when required . When this was done on 23 November 2021 with just 50 million barrels – a paltry amount in global oil supply terms – the shock value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in periods of physical supply disruptions ) helped to push benchmark oil prices down by around US $ 12 pb in the same week as the announcement . The second option would be to encourage the U.S. shale sector producers and – again , vitally – their financing banks , to ease up on the currently super-strict focus on paying down debt and returning cash to shareholders rather than increasing shale oil production . This has led to the situation in which although average oil prices were much higher in 2021 than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of U.S. shale producers last year was only 65 percent of what was spent three years earlier , according to industry figures . According to industry analysis , at US $ 100 pb , under no capital discipline , an additional 1.2 million bpd of extra oil could be expected to come from the U.S. shale sector , requiring an additional 270 rigs year on year . The third option is that Biden ’ s team finally signs a new version of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran , and removes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by OilPrice.com , could release an additional 1.7 million bpd of oil ( including 200,000 bpd of condensate and LPG/ethane ) in a six to nine-month period from when sanctions are lifted , resulting in at least a 5-10 percent likely fall in the oil price .

Barr : “ No . I can ’ t think of a legitimate reason why they should have been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , if they are classified. ” ( This doesn ’ t address Trump ’ s claim that he simply declassified them first . ) Sticking Up for the Deep State This follows Barr criticizing “ the Right. ” Journalist Bari Weiss recent asked Barr a strong question : ” So what do you say to conservatives who say , ‘ Why should we possibly trust these institutions to prosecute people — let ’ s say who protested on January 6th or agents of the state going after a president they so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them anymore ? ' ” Weiss asked , adding “ You still give them the benefit of the doubt , but many other people in your party don ’ t. ” Well , what ’ s the alternative ?

And picking and picking and picking at that sore without trying to channel those feelings in a constructive direction . In my opinion , Ronald Reagan was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , the frustrated instincts and the outrage of the people that many people who supported him but because he channeled it and was constructive about it . Yet I have heard , over and over , constructive ideas from conservatives about dealing with a corrupt Department of Justice and FBI . For starters , begin firing and arresting agents who broke the law , entrapped innocent people at protests , or doctored warrants to try and get Trump . A large part of conservative frustration is that the FBI seems to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sent to jail for . He Knows Better Ironically , in his book Barr himself seems fully cognizant of the corruption in America ’ s law enforcement institutions , and how drastic steps might beed to be taken to clean house . The attorney general also argues that the source of much of America ’ s problems on the left wing of the Democratic party , which has become totalitarian . “ Some liberal and progressive commentators suggested that our polarizing politics was somehow the consequence of an upsurge in right-wing extremism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no sentient person could take that seriously. ” Does that include the attorney general himself ? Mr. Barr observes that “ Liberal democratic ideals — strict limits on governmental power , individual rights , press freedom religious liberty — were framed within the great Anglo-American tradition and are the life ’ s blood of our Republic. ” Mr. Barr offers that this tradition was “ painstakingly wrought over many centuries from a rich amalgamation of influences , ” among them classical philosophy , Christian precepts , “ Anglo-Saxon folkways , ” the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common law . “ Under liberal democracy , ” he writes , “ it is not the role of the state to use its coercive power to remake man and society according to some abstract conception of perfection. ” He Sees the Problem , and … Shrugs The modern left , Barr concludes , has an “ incipient totalitarian style ” that is “ poisoning America ’ s political life. ” The left has adopted “ the same kind of revolutionary and totalitarian ideas that propelled the French Revolution , the Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fascists of twentieth-century Europe. ” In sum : “ Radical progressivism ’ s core idea is that there is a preordained scheme of natural earthly perfection toward which man and society must be led inexorably by the march of history. ” There ’ s more . Barr recalls that what convinced him to return as attorney general under President Trump was the politicization of governmental agencies : “ the suspect Russian collision narrative had drawn the Department of Justice and the FBI into the political maelstrom , and many Americans sensed — with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were using the criminal justice system as a political weapon. ” Mr. Barr calls the charge that the Russia helped President Trump get elected in 2016 bogus , citing “ mendacious and fraudulent attempts to invalidate the legitimate election of an American President. ” Because he had no intention of serving again after President Trump , Mr. Barr felt he could be an independent authority without an agenda . He also thinks President Trump could have won in 2020 with “ a minor adjustment in his behavior. ” Looking at election maps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters who may have been put off by his abrasive style . Mr. Barr served as attorney general under presidents Donald Trump and George Herbert Walker Bush . One Damn Thing After Another also recounts his childhood in New York City .

In his book Mr. Barr quips that while he is not the only attorney general to serve twice ( the other was John J.

"LONDON (AP) — Members of Britain’s opposition Labour Party gather in Liverpool on Sunday for their annual conference with an unfamiliar feeling: optimism. The party has been out of power for 13 years, and in the last national election in 2019, voters handed Labour its worst drubbing since 1935. But with an election due next year, polls put Labour as much as 20 points ahead of the governing Conservative Party, and Labour scored a morale-boosting special election victory in Scotland last week. Power is within the party’s grasp — as long as it doesn’t mess things up.",0

"Conservative Republican, former Virginia Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, says that “the once Grand Old Party is being driven into the gutter by a handful of right wing nut jobs,” including Rep. Bob Good (R-VA05), who Bolling claims is “the Democrats best friends.” Of course, it’s not really just “a handful of right-wing nutjobs,” because those people would have minimal power or influence if it weren’t for: a) the MAGA voters who put them in office; b) the vast majority of Republicans who don’t fight back against Trumpism and/or are happy with it; c) the failure of House Republican leadership to form a compromise, coalition-style government with House Democrats; etc. But sure, it’s more comforting for conservative Republicans like Bill Bolling to believe, falsely, that the majority of his party is sane/normal, while only a tiny percentage is off-the-deep-end extremist lunatics. Sad (and scary) to say, but that’s really not the case at this point…",0
"For many progressive American Jews, the horror and shock of a massacre of Israeli civilians has been compounded by the response by vocal segments of the far left to either withhold condemnation or cheer the murders outright. Writers like Michelle Goldberg, Julia Ioffe, and my colleague Eric Levitz, all of whom rank among the writers I most admire, have written anguished columns about the alienation of Jewish progressives from the far left. I think all their points are totally correct. But I find the frame of their response too narrow. They are treating apologias for Hamas as a factually or logically flawed application of left-wing ideals. I believe, to the contrary, that Hamas defenders are applying their own principles correctly. The problem is the principles themselves. It was around 2014 that this kind of illiberal thinking began exploding in various progressive spaces. In 2015, I wrote a story for this magazine about the rise of the illiberal left within the progressive movement. Progressive critics of my argument, while often willing to mock cancellations, firings, or other discrete manifestations of this new ideology, were skeptical that it was an ideological phenomenon. The most common response was that the shift was just college kids going through a phase.",0

On Saturday night during a speech , Trump said he 'd try to coax James into playing for him if Trump were the coach of a basketball team . If James were a woman , that is .

But , think of it it 's so crazy what 's happening . '' Trump 's speech at the TPUSA summit comes during the same summer as his state-to-state tour of endorsing candidates at rallies . Earlier this year in Nebraska , Trump took another swipe at James while talking about the NBA superstar potentially becoming a transgender woman . `` I 'll say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like very much , '' Trump said on May 1 . `` I 'll say , 'LeBron , did you ever have thoughts about going woman ?

""""""" ( Celeste McGovern ) Oh great . Bill Gates has another idea . We thought he had gone into hiding since his divorce or that he ’ d been advised to keep a low profile . He hasn ’ t said much since that squirmy interview last summer when he admitted to “ several dinners ” with his pedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein . Related COVID Did Not Panic Chiropractors . Why Not ? “ Well , he ’ s dead , ” Gates said glibly of the child trafficker who died in a prison cell awaiting trial . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epstein ’ s private plane , the “ Lolita Express ” ) to get billions for “ philanthropy , ” he explained . Oh yeah , and for advice about his “ toxic ” marriage to Melinda . Maybe she ’ s lucky to have made it out alive — and with $ 60 billion — but you ’ ve got to wonder how long ago she figured out he ’ s not what she thought he was . But Bill is back . And unapologetic as ever . He told a TED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been thinking about Emperor Augustus and how he established the first permanent fire brigade , a team to be ready to put out fires as they happened . Just so , the world needs a permanent , tax-funded $ 1-billion-a-year global pandemic fire brigade , said Gates , to stomp out viruses as they emerge . He called it a Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization team ( “ GERM ” for short ) and described how its members would be stationed at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zones , just like in the movies . In fact , Bill showed a clip from a 1990s-type outbreak film with men in orange hazmat suits jumping out of a helicopter somewhere to investigate dead bodies . Although , obviously , there are the CDC , the World Health Organization , and a massive global network of agencies and offices that already exist to do this job and which executed the COVID lockdowns and extended COVID theater globally , Gates said we don ’ t have this kind of drama team yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s GERM people sound more like a permanent pandemic police force . He even referenced Australia , which became a draconian island prison of mandates , forced quarantines and police brutality , as his model of COVID success . It ’ s not , as this video comparing COVID deaths in the lockdown capital of the world before Shanghai to unvaccinated Niger illustrates . Never mind . Since GERM is his idea — or at least he is taking credit for it — Gates seemed to be likening himself to Emperor Augustus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he ’ s revealed his emperor complex . For a non-scientist with no medical degree — a college dropout , in fact — he sure does have a lot of interest in running everything . He ’ s spent a lot of his money ( and ours , via channeling tax funds to his ideas like GERM ) buying influence in every arena he takes a fancy to controlling — from agriculture and education , to “ family planning ” and how many children people in Africa should have , to fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , technology , media , public health , and many more , not least of all , vaccines . Still , not everything has gone precisely to plan . Remember how Gates was pushing COVID vaccines before they were even invented ? He said they were our ticket back to “ normal , ” and we would all have digital passports when we got them . And remember how the media howled when “ anti-vaxxers ” and “ conspiracy theorists ” objected to being tracked and traced and said that warp speed COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work against variants ? Well , Gates conceded to the TED crowd that the COVID shots don ’ t really work that well . “ We need vaccines that actually block infections , ” he said . ( That would have been a good idea . ) “ In this case , there were lots of breakthrough infections. ” Lots and lots of them . As in , prepare to get COVID even if you were vaccinated four times . “ We need vaccines that are broad spectrum , so they work against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did not have this time , ” he added . Nope . We didn ’ t . Which is why people who listen to Bill Gates are taking their fifth “ booster ” dose now , even though that doesn ’ t work any better than the original shots . Never mind . When you are a woke genius as Gates is , you don ’ t apologize when you push ideas that fail . You simply don ’ t mention the 27,000 reported deaths from your COVID shots and the hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease and disability as side-effects . You just repeat the original preposterous claim without any scientific basis and add a modifier . Like this : “ When we look at vaccines , they were the miracle of this epidemic . They saved millions of lives , ” Gates said , “ but they can be far better. ” It ’ s like the people who say , “ I have COVID and I ’ m really , really , sick – I ’ m so sick I can hardly breathe . Thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the science . Like Pfizer ’ s big trial that reported that 15 vaccinated people in a group of 11,000 vaccinated subjects died , versus 14 deaths in a group of 11,000 who got the placebo . It works ! Then the trial was unblinded , and everyone who wanted them ( and didn ’ t ) was given the shots . Science ! But you don ’ t need hard evidence when you are Bill Gates . Or humility . He told the TED crowd that he predicted a pandemic at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the views on his talk came “ after it was too late. ” If only we had listened to him then , everything would be so much better . Notwithstanding the mainstream media ’ s fawning interviews ( listen to the lady at TED gush ) , everything Gates touches does not turn to gold . In fact , he ’ s a sort of anti-Midas – everything he touches becomes fly-covered sludge . One philanthropy disaster after another The Los Angeles Times wrote in 2007 about the “ dark cloud ” over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the conflicts of his massive investments in big corporations whose practices were killing and maiming people , including children , in the poorest countries where he was profiting from his philanthropy . Later , he had big ideas about transforming America ’ s public schools ( though he and his kids went to private schools , of course . ) He told a Harvard University interviewer in 2013 that he wouldn ’ t know for “ probably a decade ” if his “ education stuff ” worked . It took only three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dismal failure . School boards were left footing the bill for his big ideas , and Bill walked out on the payments when the program capsized . Oops . Never mind . Same with his agricultural reforms . When he and Melinda partnered ? with the Rockefeller Foundation in the ? $ 424 million Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa ? ( AGRA ) to increase food productivity and incomes , they forced local farmers to abandon their traditional techniques , and instead use ? imported commercial seeds , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gates ? pressured African governments ? to massively fund his whims and penalize farmers who wouldn ’ t comply . The results : nutrition and production plummeted . A 2020 report documented how extreme hunger increased 30 % in the countries Gates targeted for his farming fancy . Never mind . Big business — er , philanthropy goes that way . Just like the Gates-funded initiatives to test contraceptives on women and to reduce fertility in poor nations while reaping profits from drug companies who make birth control – all under the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . Polio is not gone There is a big virus in Bill ’ s polio eradication program , too . He boasts about it in one of his recent blogs . “ Thanks to investments made by governments , the private sector , and philanthropy , wild polio cases are at a historic low , and the disease is endemic in just two countries : Pakistan and Afghanistan. ” Notice he said “ wild polio ” is just about gone . That ’ s because something called “ circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of wild polio . That ’ s right – it ’ s a disease that looks and paralyzes just like the original polio but it ’ s called “ vaccine-derived ” because it comes from the oral polio vaccine that was cancelled by the West for causing the disease it is meant to prevent , but is proffered all over poor nations by technocrats like Bill Gates ( and Pope Francis ) . It ’ s flourishing . There were outbreaks of cVDP in 25 countries last year , including Nigeria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRC ) , Malawi and Israel last month . They occur in vaccinated and unvaccinated children , caused by the virus in the vial that sheds from inoculated children . The answer of technocrats to the failure of their polio vaccines : vaccinate more . Sound familiar ? It also happens that in India , where Bill Gates claims polio has been wiped out because of his interventions , there are tens of thousands of cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis ( NPAFP ) which doctors describe as “ clinically indistinguishable from polio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they report the incidence of is “ directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. ” When vaccination stops , the non-polio polio incidence drops . Thanks Bill . Never mind his kooky ideas of blocking out the sun to cool global warming or his inhalable vaccines . Do you see the pattern of Emperor Bill here ? So enamored with his own genius , so surrounded by sycophants , so psychopathic that he doesn ’ t see the stupidity of his big ideas or the tidal wave of injury in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he intends it . Bill said he hasn ’ t got someone to put forward his big GERM idea yet at the WHO . You can bet he ’ s lying , and all his toadies are in line to secure the “ global consensus ” for his GERM police force and its funding by the “ rich countries ” ( which means you and me ) , too . Will we have to suffer through this next stupid idea from this unelected self-declared genius with an emperor complex , too ?

Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin , who chairs the Commons Liaison Committee , spoke to BBC Radio 4 's Today programme this morning . ‘ There ’ s no question it ’ s over for Boris Johnson as Prime Minster and I went to tell him that at lunchtime yesterday after Prime Minister ’ s Questions . ‘ There are three ways a prime minister can be removed ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ’ s happening , but it ’ s astonishing he hasn ’ t got the message from that . ‘ Second ; the bigger vote of confidence in the Conservative Party to remove him as leader and he would have to go. ’ ‘ And ultimately , there could be a vote of confidence in the House of Commons and I don ’ t think he would want to bring it to that . ' I just said to him , look , it ’ s just when you go now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can go with some dignity or you can be forced out like Donald Trump clinging to power and pretending he ’ s won the election when he ’ s lost . ‘ I hope he ’ ll go today – he really must go today . I mean the reason why - I wasn ’ t at the 1922 executive yesterday – but the reason why I think they decided not to change the rules… first of all , we ’ re due a re-election ; but the second reason is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Surely he sees the writing on the wall . I mean it ’ s got a kind of Macbeth-like quality at the moment . Birnam wood will never come to Dunsinane , and I am not of woman born. ’ Former Cabinet minister Julian Smith also warned that the premier had seen how Donald Trump behaved in relation to the Capitol riots after the US election , and was looking to have a 'mini version in the UK ' . Mr Johnson 's personal approval rating has even dipped below Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Capitol riot on January 6 , 2022 . According to YouGov , just 23 per cent of voters approve of Mr Johnson - with the figure likely to fall further still after a chaotic week in No.10 . Mr Trump 's personal approval rating hit a low as he left office after the January 6 Capitol riot - languishing at a meagre 34 per cent , according to Gallup . Mr Trump refused to admit that he lost the 2020 Presidential election to Joe Biden in months of delusional ramblings which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol building as Congress were trying to certify the Electoral College result . Mr Johnson bizarrely sacked Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove yesterday - after a delegation of Cabinet colleagues had entered No.10 in order to try and convince the Prime Minister to resign . The PM has vowed defiance on multiple occasions yesterday - a stand which shows no signs of abating despite more Government resignations today . Deputy PM Dominic Raab is thought to have told the Prime Minister that he risked putting the monarch in an intolerable position if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sun reports . The Queen , 96 , was yesterday pictured being driven from Wood Farm near Sandringham , Norfolk , to her helicopter which flew her back to Windsor Castle . She typically holds a weekly meeting with the Prime Minister on Wednesdays , which have frequently taken place over the phone since the coronavirus pandemic broke out , but it is not clear whether it occurred yesterday amid the pandemonium surrounding Mr Johnson 's leadership . Concern among MPs comes following the approval of the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , repealing the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and allowing for the body to be dissolved by the Queen 'on the request of the prime minister ' . Conservative MPs worry that the Prime Minister could try to use it to save his premiership . Constitutional experts have branded the 'nuclear option ' of asking the Queen for a dissolution 'deluded madness ' which would spark a crisis as the monarch would be obliged to turned down his request . Under the UK 's uncodified constitution and the so-called 'Lascelles Principles ' , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament if a Conservative MP is able to command the confidence of a majority of the House of Commons . Despite the UK being a parliamentary democracy , Mr Johnson claimed to have a presidential-style personal mandate from the last election , apparently saying : 'If the party wants to overthrow the elected will of the people , they have to dip their hands in blood . ' Supporters are fleeing the PM as the resignation tally now stands at 54 following the resignation of Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and six others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweeted that he could not longer continue without 'honesty , integrity and mutual respect ' . Minutes later Treasury minister Helen Whately followed suit saying 'there are only so many times you can apologise and move on ' . Security minister Damian Hinds and science minister George Freeman had followed by 7.30am , and pensions minister Guy Opperman by 7.50am . Meanwhile , Wales minister David TC Davies publicly announced that he had refused a promotion to take over from Welsh Secretary Simon Hart , who quit last night . The Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson to resign and said she is only staying in place to keep the government functioning . The government has been unable to find a minister willing to go on the airwaves to speak up for the PM this morning - although his critics have been swarming to studios . The Prime Minister now faces the ignominy of a second vote of no confidence by his own party after the 1922 Committee elections on Monday . Mr Johnson narrowly won a confidence vote earlier this year and is nominally protected from another under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next executive of the backbench Tory committee is likely to scrap this rule to remove the Prime Minister .

""""""" I think one of the most bizarre social developments of the past 10 years in the US has been the slow but steady shift of the political left as supposed defenders of free speech to enemies of free speech . The level of mental gymnastics on display by leftists to justify their attacks on freedom and the 1st Amendment is bewildering . So much so that I begin to question if liberals and leftists ever actually had any respect for 1st Amendment rights to begin with ? Or , maybe the only freedom they cared about all along was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steady progression of this war on speech and ideas , and the end game is predictable : Is anyone really that surprised that the Biden Administration is implementing a Ministry of Truth in the form of the DHS Disinformation Governance Board ? Can we just accept the reality at this point that leftists are evil and their efforts feed into an agenda of authoritarianism ? Is there any evidence to the contrary ? Before I get into this issue , I think it ’ s important to point out that it ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days suggesting that meeting leftists “ somewhere in the middle ” is the best and most desirable option . I see this attitude all over the place and I think it comes from a certain naivety about the situation we are facing as a country . Moderates and “ normies ” along with people like Bill Maher and Russell Brand are FINALLY starting to realize how bag-lady-crazy leftists are and the pendulum is swinging back slightly . But , it was conservatives that were calling out the social justice cult and their highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else was blissfully ignorant , we were fighting the battles that stalled the leftist advance . This is not to say I ’ m not happy to have moderates and reformed liberals on board , it ’ s a great thing . However , the time for diplomacy and meeting leftists halfway is long dead . There is no such thing as a “ center ” in our society anymore , either you lean conservative and you support freedom , or you lean left and support authoritarianism . There is no magical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make things right . We are not required to tolerate leftist authoritarianism because of “ democracy. ” Sometimes certain ideologies and certain groups are mutually exclusive to freedom ; meaning , they can not coexist within a society that values liberty . We need to be clear about where the lines are drawn , because sitting on the fence is not an option . Walk in middle of road ? Get squished like grape . To understand how leftists got to the point of enthusiastic hatred of free speech rights there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be addressed . These include specific ideals that leftists value that are disjointed or simply irrational : Hate Speech Is Real And Must Be Censored ? First , as I have argued for many years , there is no such thing as “ hate speech. ” There is speech that some people don ’ t like and speech they are offended by . That is all . Constitutionally , there is no hate speech . People are allowed to say any offensive thing they wish and believe however they wish as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s reputation with lies or threatening them with direct bodily harm . If you are offended by criticism , that is your problem . Leftists believe the opposite . Instead of growing a thicker skin they think that “ hate speech ” should be illegal and that they should be the people that determine what hate speech is . This is a kind of magical door to power , because if you can declare yourself the arbiter of hate speech you give yourself the authority to control ALL speech . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you have to do is label everything you don ’ t like as hate speech , no matter how factual , and you now dictate the course of society . No one is capable of this kind of objectivity or benevolence . No person alive has the ability to determine what speech is acceptable without bias . Like the One Ring in the Lord of The Rings , there is no individual or group capable of wielding such power without being corrupted by it . Either there is no hate speech , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in direct reference to social media websites and it ’ s an oversimplification of the issue of free speech and large social media platforms . Here is the conundrum or “ false paradigm ” if you will : Leftists argue for private property rights , but only when it comes to vast corporate big tech platforms like Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , etc . They like private property rights for companies that they think are on their side politically ; they hate private property rights for everyone else . Just look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s recent Twitter buyout ; the leftists are demanding that Musk be stopped at all costs , and they demand that the SEC and FCC step in to disrupt the sale because they claim Musk ’ s purchase is a “ threat to democracy. ” The media itself is clamoring to disrupt Musk ’ s takeover of Twitter . Whether or not you trust him , Musk ’ s acquisition of the platform has at least exposed the totalitarian attitudes of mainstream journalists for everyone to see . They are now even admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that it is “ their job , ” and they see Musk as a threat to that monopoly . Why are Elon Musk ’ s private property rights less important or protected than the original shareholders of Twitter ( Vangaurd , BlackRock , Morgan Stanley and a Saudi Prince ) ? Because Musk does not claim to represent leftist designs and interests ? Leftists have no principles , they only care about manufacturing consent . Their method of winning requires that they never restrict themselves within the boundaries of values or morals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pure evil . Beyond that irony , though , is the deeper issue of government intervention vs business rights . Many people seem to think that government power is supposed to balance out corporate power when the truth is that governments and corporations work hand in hand ; they are often one in the same entity . Twitter and other Big Tech platforms receive billions upon billions of dollars in government stimulus and tax incentives every year . Corporations as a concept are essentially a socialist creation . They enjoy limited liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protections under government charter . With all these protections , incentives , bailouts and stimulus measures it is almost impossible for small and new businesses to compete with them . They represent a monopoly through cartel ; they control the marketplace by colluding with each other and colluding with the government . A perfect example of this would be the coordination between multiple Big Tech companies to bring down Parler , a conservative leaning competitor to Twitter . This required some of the biggest companies in the world working in unison along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of a new company to offer an alternative , and all because Parler was getting too big . In the case of a private person ’ s home or their small business or small website , it ’ s true that there are no free speech rights . They can kick you out and they don ’ t have to give a reason . But when it comes to massive conglomerates that receive billions in OUR tax dollars in order to stay alive , no , they do not deserve private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves into a public utility , and that means they are subject to constitutional limitations just as public schools and universities are . This is a concept that leftists just don ’ t grasp . They view corporate power as sacrosanct…as long as it serves their interests . Consider global corporations like Disney and their open intention to undermine the passage of Florida ’ s anti-grooming bill ; this represents Disney ’ s vocal support for the sexualization and indoctrination of children in Florida schools . Leftists cheered the announcement and claimed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be wrecked . Instead , the state turned the tables and took away incentives they had been giving to Disney for decades . Leftists responded by accusing Governor DeSantis of being a “ fascist ” and attacking free speech . But let ’ s break this down : Leftists happily supported Disney , a massive conglomerate , and their efforts to undermine the will of the voters in Florida . The state government stops them from undermining the voters by taking away the money and special incentives that belong to the voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a violation of Disney ’ s rights ? The disparity between leftist arguments on Elon Musk ’ s takeover of Twitter vs. Disney ’ s attempted sabotage of Florida law could not be more confused . When it comes to Twitter they love the idea of censorship and react with panic when the mere prospect of free speech ( within the confines of US law ) is presented . When it comes to Disney , they say they love the idea of free speech , and anyone that wants to limit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how criminal , is accused of fascism . The difference is obvious – Musk appears to be an uncontrolled element , while Disney is an “ ally. ” Free speech and property rights are only allowed for one side of the cultural divide . Leftists attacking freedom is free speech ; defending ourselves against those attacks is a threat to democracy . It ’ s absurd . Disinformation Is A Threat And Censorship Is The Solution ? The holy grail of censorship is not website filters and algorithms , because as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platforms could be built or purchased by someone that does not share in the leftist agenda . Instead , government intervention and the ability to define what is proper and improper discourse is the ultimate goal . The end game of authoritarians is always to write mass censorship into law , as if it is justified once it is codified . Corporate elites and political puppets like Biden pontificating about the threat of “ disinformation ” is hilarious for a number of reasons , but mainly because it is the power brokers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purveyors of disinformation for a long time . Suddenly today they care about the spread of lies ? I think it is obvious that such people are far more worried about the spread of facts , evidence and truth . They can not debate on fair ground because they will lose , so , the only other option is to silence us . The institution of the Disinformation Governance Board is a clear indication that the establishment and the useful idiots on the political left are becoming DESPERATE . Their grip on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw this during their recent attempts to enforce medical tyranny across the country in the name of covid . Luckily , conservatives in at least 20 red states fought against the implementation of covid lockdowns , mandates and vaccine passports which would have annihilated our constitutional rights forever . For years I heard the argument that when the jackboots arrived conservatives would do nothing , and now we know this is nonsense . Some of the few free places in the world during two years of pandemic fear mongering were red states in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest concentration of conservatives . If you want to know what our country would look like had conservatives not stopped the tide of tyranny , just take a gander at China today . They have some of the strictest covid mandates on the planet and yet they are once again locking down millions of citizens due to “ high infection rates. ” Not only that , but they are starving their own people in the process . It ’ s madness , and it ’ s exactly what leftists were arguing in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The US is mostly open today , just as red states like mine have been free for almost the entirety of the pandemic , and what has changed ? Half the country is still unvaccinated – Is there mass death in the streets ? Nope . Nothing has changed in terms of covid . The mandates made no difference whatsoever , other than to disrupt the economy and reduce people ’ s freedoms . Not long ago , pointing out this fact was considered “ disinformation ” that needed to be silenced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter Biden laptop story was called disinformation . The Wuhan Lab story was called disinformation . Fauci ’ s gain of function research on covid at the Wuhan lab was called disinformation . The fact that vaccinated people still contract and die from covid was called disinformation . In other words , what the government and corporate oligarchs call “ disinformation ” today is eventually called reality tomorrow . I would be happy to enter into a fair debate with White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on any of the above issues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ” but she would never do such a thing because she knows she would be crushed like a bug . It is not the government ’ s job to protect the public from information , whether real or fake . It is not their job to filter or censor data or ideas . They are not qualified to do this . No one is . Leftists operate from a collectivist mentality and this makes them believe that society is a singular entity that needs to be managed and manipulated to achieve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual responsibility and discernment , but that is a side note to the real problem . They support information control because facts and ideas outside of their narrative could possibly damage that narrative . And , if the narrative is damaged they lose their feeling of power , which is all they really care about . If your narrative is so fragile that it does not hold up to scrutiny or alternative viewpoints then it must not be worth much of a damn . If you have to force people or manipulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then your ideology must be fundamentally flawed . The truth speaks volumes for itself and eventually wins without force . Only lies need to be forced into the collective consciousness . Only lies require tyranny . Eventually reality wins over propaganda , unless total censorship and totalitarianism can be achieved . Nothing has changed in the 200+ years since the creation of the Bill of Rights . Free speech is still integral to a functioning society . Without it , society crumbles . They will claim that today things are different and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from itself. ” This is what tyrants always say when trying to steal power . Most people reading this know by now that this is a war . It ’ s not a political debate that requires give-and-take , but a full-bore winner-take-all conflict . A DHS faction which is mandated to monitor our speech and propagandize the public is unacceptable and must be eliminated . Leftist and globalist monopoly of social media communications platforms is unacceptable and must be eliminated . The imposition of leftist and globalist ideology into the media narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must be eliminated . This is about saving the remaining embers of American culture . If we do not take an aggressive stand now , the next generation may never know liberty . Everything we hold dear is at stake . """"""",1

""""""" Evidence is emerging of fractures in the remnant of the climate school strike movement Greta Thunberg once led . The fight for a future free of climate change and war is the fight for world socialism ! International Youth and Students for Social Equality ( Australia ) 5 May 2022 This week and next , students and youth around Australia are participating in protests opposing government inaction on climate change and the degradation of the environment . But we warn that the organisers of the events , School Strike 4 Climate ( SS4C ) , are seeking to derail mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very political parties responsible for the environmental crisis . Any suggestion that the upcoming federal election on May 21 will help to resolve climate change , or any other substantive issue facing youth and workers , is a complete lie . Actions planned this month by the SS4C are deliberately narrow in focus . In the past , rallies—which were attended by hundreds of thousands nationally—were part of global climate strikes involving millions of youth . This time , events planned are small and isolated as a deliberate attempt to smother increasingly radicalised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events are specifically advertised as “ election climate strikes ” with regional centres and cities not even organising events . A number of the actions are not even strikes . Greta Thunberg is barely newsworthy these days , but I hope some of you find the final collapse of her movement interesting . The International Socialists are a bit of a remnant themselves . I doubt the International Socialists could muster more than a hundred or so mostly ageing “ students ” to a rally , at least in Australia . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much done , angry young people have flocked to more interesting brands like Antifa or Extinction Rebellion . And the idea of a Greta school strike outside major cities and a few big regional centres is laughable . Left wing support for higher fuel prices in the name of climate action does not play well in most of rural Australia . Our vast distances make the push for electrified transport and high gasoline prices a painful experience for most rural people . Maybe at the height of Greta ’ s movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned 18 , she could have mustered a few followers in rural Australia . What I find interesting about this statement by the International Socialists is confirmation that Greta ’ s brand , her once impressive global climate school strike movement , seems to have fallen so far that her fellow travellers have no hesitation trying to put her down to make themselves look better . Not that it will do the socialists any good . In two weeks Australians vote in a federal election . Greta Thunberg and her school strike movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Australia , along with the fake climate crisis . A few inner city conservatives are panicking over a challenge from people who claim to be green independents , but few people outside the inner city latte set care about the “ crisis of our time ” . There is an immense cloud of apathy hanging over the upcoming Aussie Federal election , none of the mainstream candidates are inspiring . Cost of living is a big concern , but nobody seems to be offering convincing solutions . The election is shaping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who promises more of the same , and the challenger , whose lack of preparation and inability to remember anything about the economy he will be expected to manage has become a key election issue .

""""""" Kim Potter , the former suburban Minneapolis police officer who said she confused her handgun for her Taser when she fatally shot Daunte Wright , has been sentenced to two years in prison MINNEAPOLIS -- Kim Potter , the former suburban Minneapolis police officer who said she confused her handgun for her Taser when she fatally shot Daunte Wright , was sentenced Friday to two years in prison . Wright ’ s family denounced the sentence as too lenient and accused the judge of giving more consideration to the white officer than the Black victim . Potter was convicted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the April 11 killing of Wright , a 20-year-old Black motorist . She was sentenced only on the more serious charge in accordance with state law . Wright ’ s mother , Katie Wright , said after the sentencing that Potter “ murdered my son , ” adding : “ Today the justice system murdered him all over again. ” She also accused the judge of being taken in by “ white woman ’ s tears ” after Potter cried during her pre-sentencing statement . Speaking before the sentence was imposed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter and that she would refer to her only as “ the defendant ” because Potter only referred to her son as “ the driver ” at trial . “ She never once said his name . And for that I ’ ll never be able to forgive you . And I ’ ll never be able to forgive you for what you ’ ve stolen from us , ” said Wright , who also sometimes uses the last name Bryant . “ Daunte Demetrius Wright , I will continue to fight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer a death sentence , ” she said . Potter offered an apology to Wright 's family , then spoke directly to his mother : “ Katie , I understand a mother ’ s love . I ’ m sorry I broke your heart ... my heart is broken and devastated for all of you. ” The judge , who imposed a sentence below state guidelines , called it “ one of the saddest cases I ’ ve had on my 20 years on the bench. ” Judge Regina Chu said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters in support of Potter . “ On the one hand , a young man was killed and on the other , a respected 26-year veteran police officer made a tragic error by pulling her handgun instead of her Taser. ” Chu said the lesser sentence was warranted because Potter was “ in the line of duty and doing her job in attempting to lawfully arrest Daunte Wright , ” and Potter was trying to protect another officer who could have been dragged and seriously injured if Wright drove away . The judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her sentence , or 16 months in prison , with the rest on parole . She has earned credit for 58 days that she has been in the state ’ s women ’ s prison in Shakopee since the guilty verdict . Wright was killed after Brooklyn Center officers pulled him over for having expired license tags and an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror . Civil rights advocates complain that laws against hanging objects from rearview mirrors have been used as a pretext for stopping Black motorists . The shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trial in Minneapolis on murder charges in George Floyd ’ s killing , sparked several days of demonstrations outside the Brooklyn Center police station marked by tear gas and clashes between protesters and police . Potter and Chauvin were convicted in the same courtroom . Wright family attorney Ben Crump said the family was stunned by the sentence , saying they did n't understand why such consideration was given to a white officer in the killing of a young Black man when a Black officer , Mohamed Noor , got a longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white woman , Justine Ruszczyk Damond . “ What we see today is the legal system in Black and white. ” But the judge said the case was not the same as other high-profile killings by police . “ This is not a cop found guilty of murder for using his knee to pin down a person for 9 1/2 minutes as he gasped for air . This is not a cop found guilty of manslaughter for intentionally drawing his firearm and shooting across his partner and killing an unarmed woman who approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to Chauvin and Noor . “ This is a cop who made a tragic mistake . '' For someone with no criminal history , such as Potter , the state guidelines on first-degree manslaughter range from slightly more than six years to about 8 1/2 years in prison , with the presumptive sentence being just over seven years . Prosecutors initially argued that aggravating factors warranted a sentence above the guideline range , saying Potter abused her authority as an officer and that her actions caused a greater-than-normal danger to others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the presumptive sentence was proper . “ His life mattered , and that life was taken , ” Frank said before sentencing . “ His name is Daunte Wright . We have to say his name . He was not just a driver . He was a living human being . A life. ” Defense attorney Paul Engh asked for a sentence below the guidelines , including probation only , arguing that Wright was the aggressor . He said the testimony of other officers on the scene showed it was a dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and Potter had the right to defend other officers . Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison , whose office prosecuted the case , said he accepts the sentence and urged others to do the same . People should remember Daunte Wright and “ know that no number of years in prison could ever capture the wonder of this young man ’ s life , ” Ellison said in a statement . But , he said , the sentence doesn ’ t take away from “ the truth of the jury ’ s verdict. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death was `` beyond tragic for everybody involved . '' But , he added : “ This was an unintentional crime . It was an accident . It was a mistake. ” Engh said if Potter were to receive probation , she would be willing to meet with Wright ’ s family and to speak to police officers about Taser mix-ups , as suggested by prosecutors . Engh also held up a box displaying what he said were among “ thousands ” of letters and cards of support for Potter . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , '' Engh said . `` This is unheard of for a defendant . I dare say no one in this room has ever seen anything like this. ” Evidence at Potter ’ s trial showed officers learned he had an outstanding warrant for a weapons possession charge and they tried to arrest him when he pulled away .

"Whenever I do a potted biography of Danny Dorling, geographer, author, crusader, I miss the late Dawn Foster, thinking of her going through his bibliography in the office ahead of meeting him, saying: “Fuck, I can never read all this.” His first book, published nearly 30 years ago, had the arrestingly dry title Area Cartograms: Their Use and Creation. Then, in 2010, something changed: well, the government changed, austerity was born and Dorling became, in public, the radical geographer that academic colleagues – first at Bristol, then Leeds, then Sheffield, then for the past 10 years at St Peter’s College, Oxford – must have always known him to be. Starting with Injustice: Why Social Inequality Still Persists in 2010, he would write at least one book a year and sometimes as many as three, on justice and equality, until 2018, when he published Peak Inequality. Spoiler: we were not at the peak, but that’s not what he meant. I meet him in Greenwich, south-east London, where he is between meetings at a conference on inequality. He has a new book, Shattered Nation: Inequality and the Geography of a Failing State. The picture he draws is delineated carefully through appalling statistics: over the first five years of austerity, the poorest fifth of people in England lost, on average, 11% of their income, while the richest fifth lost nothing. There are now twice as many food banks in the UK as there are branches of McDonald’s. “The country [is] moving towards a minarchy, or night-watchman state, with minimal power over the rich and minimal support for the poorer of its citizens,” he writes. When he started writing this book two years ago, he thought he needed to explain how bad things were, in case some people still didn’t know: he finished writing it just as the lettuce lasted longer than Liz Truss. “I no longer have to persuade anyone how bad it is. Early this year, the government bunged BMW £75m not to close the Cowley car plant. On the same day, they cut £250m from social security spending, I don’t think entirely because they wanted to, but because for the government to borrow money, they had to show that they weren’t going to increase spending overall. So they really have run out of money.”",0
"On Tuesday evening, I was drinking on the porch of my friend and neighbor Misha Shulman, the Israel-born rabbi of a progressive New York synagogue called the New Shul. All day, he’d been on the phone with congregants deeply distraught over the massacres and mass kidnappings in Israel. Of all the people he spoke to, he said, those most devastated were either people who had lost close friends or family, or young Jews “completely shattered by the response of their lefty friends in New York,” who were either justifying Hamas’s atrocities or celebrating them outright. This sense of deep betrayal is not limited to New York. Many progressive Jews have been profoundly shaken by the way some on the left are treating the terrorist mass murder of civilians as noble acts of anticolonial resistance. These are Jews who share the left’s abhorrence of the occupation of Gaza and of the enormities inflicted on it, which are only going to get worse if and when Israel invades. But the way keyboard radicals have condoned war crimes against Israelis has left many progressive Jews alienated from political communities they thought were their own. By now, you’ve probably seen examples. There was the giddy message put out by the national committee of Students for Justice in Palestine, which proclaimed, “Today, we witness a historic win for the Palestinian resistance: across land, air and sea.” New York’s chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America promoted a rally where speakers applauded the attacks, and the Connecticut D.S.A. enthused, “Yesterday, the Palestinian resistance launched an unprecedented anticolonial struggle.” The president of N.Y.U.’s student bar association wrote in its newsletter, “I will not condemn Palestinian resistance,” leading to the withdrawal of a job offer. Over the otherwise benign slogan “I stand with Palestine,” Black Lives Matter Chicago posted a photo of a figure in a paraglider like those Hamas used to descend on a desert rave and turn it into a killing field.",0

""""""" Lloyd Russell-Moyle , a Labour MP , argued in a debate about sex education that children should be taught about “ risky sex acts , ” claiming it would save lives . On Thursday , MPs debated the current state of sex education in British schools in Westminster Hall , a secondary debating room aside from the House of Commons . The debate was brought forward by Conservative MP Miriam Cates , who revealed the disturbing results of the Conservative government ’ s policy on sex education . The new framework designed by the government has “ opened the floodgates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education materials to schools , ” Cates noted , meaning that “ children across the country are being exposed to a plethora of deeply inappropriate , wildly inaccurate , and sexually explicit and damaging materials. ” Cates gave a number of examples of damaging material that was being taught to students via a number of different private bodies , including : • That sex is “ anything that makes you horny and aroused ( The School of Sexuality Education ) . • That the legislation regarding the age of consent is not there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensual sex , ” and that 14 year olds can consent to sex with each other ( It Happens Education ) . • A dice game that matches two body parts together , including the anus , vulva , penis and mouth , designed to get children to “ name a pleasurable sexual act ” that can take place between those body parts ( The Proud Trust ) . Even a website from the government ’ s own Department of Health and Social Care that was recommended as part of Department of Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to “ read a really hot bit of erotica while looking up Dominance and Submission. ” “ Just as in the covid pandemic when we sacrificed young for old , our approach to sex education is sacrificing the welfare and innocence of children in the interests of adults ’ sexual liberation , ” Cates argued . “ We do not try to teach babies to read or teach quantum mechanics to six-year-olds , because they are not developmentally ready , and neither should we teach about sexual pleasure or gender fluidity to pre-pubescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adolescents , ” she added . However , Russell-Moyle , who was only the second MP to declare that he is HIV positive , explicitly disagreed that children should not be taught about “ risky sex acts. ” Russell-Moyle revealed that a 15-year-old cousin passed away within the last two years after attempting autoerotic asphyxiation . “ If he had been taught about risky sex acts—he was 15 , not a pre-pubescent child—and how to make sure he did things safely , rather than just learning something from the internet that then led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might still be around and his family might not be devastated , ” he argued , adding that he has “ a problem with saying that we should not teach any of this to our children. ” “ The principle of learning about things before people are legally able to do them but when they are physically able to engage in them , which 15-year-olds are , I am afraid , could have been lifesaving , ” Russell-Moyle continued . The Brighton MP claimed that when children were “ of age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices ” about these risky sex acts . He did admit that there should be a discussion on the risks involved , but alongside the promotion of them . The debate also included discussion of how trans issues were taught two children , which involved extremely explicit sexual language , and totally misleading or debateable information , something Cates said shocked her as a former biology teacher . Children in British schools are currently being taught that “ children fall into two groups : menstruators or non-menstruators , ” that “ boys who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight lifting might actually be the opposite sex , ” and that “ a woman is still a woman , even if she enjoys getting blow jobs . ” """"""",1
"The public feud in the US between Elon Musk and the Anti-Defamation League is shaping up to be a high-stakes endeavor for both parties and could mark a defining moment in the battle over the borders of acceptable political discourse. Musk, the tech mogul who bought Twitter last year and later renamed it X, has lifted many restrictions on alleged hate speech and other moderated content on the platform as part of his stated free-speech agenda. The ADL, a robust advocacy group against antisemitism and racism, has publicly criticized Musk’s policy, joining calls for advertisers to drop X. Musk this month threatened the ADL with a massive libel suit. The confrontation was the latest eruption in the longstanding tug-of-war between anti-hate watchdog groups like the ADL — which was established in 1913 and has hundreds of employees and an annual budget of more than $80 million — and platforms like X that have resisted demands to censor their content.",0
"A fissure in the Texas Republican party exploded into the open with the House impeachment of Attorney General Ken Paxton and the Senate’s decision not to convict. The head of the Senate, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, excoriated his colleagues on the House side and drew into sharp relief the intra-party fight between Texas’ traditional, more business-focused Republicans and a far right wing of the party. This all came out into the open after eight top staffers in the Attorney General’s Office reported Ken Paxton to the FBI, alleging bribery and abuse of office. Their report, filed just over three years ago, kicked off a political and legal fight still ongoing despite the Senate impeachment acquittal.",0
"Republicans in the House of Representatives are confronted with two critical issues — the impeachment inquiry into President Biden and the threat of a government shutdown — that may determine the future of their leadership and the outcome of the 2024 congressional elections. Washington observers predict chaos, and at the center of the chaos is Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). McCarthy needed 15 ballots over four days to ascend to the speakership in January and his precarious hold on that position depends on support from the most conservative Republican congressmen, members of the Freedom Caucus who doubt McCarthy’s ideological purity. McCarthy needed their votes to win the speakership and still needs them to maintain it because the GOP majority is so thin. If he loses five votes, his majority disappears.",0
""""""" FAIRFAX , Va. ( AP ) — A judge in Virginia on Friday denied efforts to keep documents sealed in the case of a man with alleged neo-Nazi sympathies who is accused of killing his girlfriend ’ s parents . The ruling follows motions by The Washington Post and The Associated Press to access the records , citing the public ’ s interest and the news organizations ’ constitutional rights . Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Brett Kassabian said in court that his order won ’ t take effect for 10 days to give the defense and prosecution time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a written ruling later . The documents ' pending release is expected to reveal more details from the yearslong prosecution of Nicholas Giampa , which has been shrouded in secrecy since the December 2017 shootings . Giampa was 17 when authorities charged him in the killings of Scott Fricker , 48 , and Buckley Kuhn-Fricker , 43 , in their Herndon , Virginia , home . The case attracted national attention because of evidence Giampa espoused neo-Nazi philosophies . Neighbors said the teen mowed a huge swastika into a community field . Family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fricker and Kuhn-Fricker intervened to try to stop their daughter from dating Giampa . Few details about the case had been released , at first because Giampa was a juvenile . Giampa is now an adult and being tried as one , but the judge had previously ordered the overwhelming bulk of the court file sealed from the public . In an order dated July 8 that has been made public , Judge Brett Kassabian granted a motion from Giampa ’ s lawyers to suppress statements he made because authorities had n't provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miranda Rights , ” which guarantee his right to remain silent and to speak to an attorney before he speaks to police . The order did not explain how officers failed to grant Giampa his rights . And prosecutors ’ arguments as to why they believe Giampa ’ s statements were lawfully obtained were not made public . Kassabian took the unusual step of sealing the case file , even though Virginia law favors open court records except under extraordinary circumstances . At a 2018 hearing , psychologists testified that brain damage from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered Giampa unable to fully understand trial proceedings .

""""""" LOUISVILLE , Ky. ( AP ) — U.S. Sen. Rand Paul rarely targets his likely Democratic challenger by name , but the Republican 's campaign attacks in Kentucky are unmistakably aimed at Charles Booker 's agenda — in what 's shaping up as a populist-themed battle featuring starkly different ideas to win the people over . In his pursuit of a third Senate term , Paul projects a national voice for a libertarian-leaning philosophy based on limited government and restrained spending . Booker , his ideological opposite , promotes a New Deal-style economic platform . Booker is the clear frontrunner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State 's primary election next Tuesday . Paul drew five little-known Republican challengers , while Booker has three primary opponents . Both are campaigning with an eye on the general election in a state that has veered sharply toward the GOP . In recent years , Democrats running statewide have struggled to remain competitive in Kentucky , with one notable exception : Democratic Gov . Andy Beshear , who narrowly unseated a Republican incumbent in 2019 , remains popular ahead of his 2023 reelection run . Paul , who ran for the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge fundraising advantage and is heavily favored to win reelection in November . Kentucky has not elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since Wendell Ford in 1992 . But sparks could fly in a matchup between two candidates not known for toning down their views . Booker , a Black former state lawmaker , insists he can reverse his party 's sagging fortunes after a succession of Senate losses by more moderate Democrats . In 2020 , Booker gained attention for his racial and economic justice message amid nationwide protests over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other Black Americans in encounters with police . Booker barely lost the Democratic Senate primary that year to an establishment-backed rival . Back with the same agenda in 2022 , Booker offers up a progressive platform that he ’ s dubbed the Kentucky New Deal . He says social programs like Medicare for All and a basic universal income would uplift cross sections of Kentuckians — a “ hood to the holler ” message meant to resonate from poor urban neighborhoods to struggling Appalachian towns . “ I ’ m running a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divides , ” Booker told The Associated Press in a recent interview . “ And addressing poverty , ensuring true community safety and making sure that we can live a meaningful life focused on love and humanity. ” For Paul , such sweeping social proposals are prime examples of an overly expansive federal government that he 's warned against since his first Senate run . Paul , an ardent free-market advocate , has bashed socialism for years , vowing to fight it “ with every fiber of my being. ” “ The allure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , '' Paul said at a recent campaign rally . `` Most of us instinctively know that nothing really in life is free . That you have to work hard . But there are people among us ... who succumb to this sort of siren call . This idea that there is something out there that you don ’ t have to work for . That somehow we can get something for free. ” Booker said there 's nothing radical about making sure everyone has quality health care . He accuses the senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic and criminal justice issues to try to tear him down . First elected in the tea party-driven wave of 2010 , Paul touted his less-intrusive philosophy in denouncing what he saw as government overreach in response to COVID-19 . Paul has waged memorable clashes with Dr. Anthony Fauci , the country ’ s top infectious disease expert , over the government ’ s coronavirus policies and the origins of the virus that caused the global pandemic , and has used those disputes to raise campaign contributions . Paul , long a self-styled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the verge of acquiring more Senate power . He says he ’ s in line to assume a committee chairmanship if the GOP wins Senate control after the November election . The Senate currently has a 50-50 split , but Democrats have the slim edge because Vice President Kamala Harris is a tie-breaking vote . He vows to wage a vigorous review into the origins of COVID-19 if he lands the chairmanship . “ When we take over in November , I will be chairman of a committee and I will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ And we will get to the bottom of where this virus came from. ” During a recent appearance on Kentucky Educational Television , Booker tried tapping into the populist wave stirred by Republican Donald Trump , saying the former president “ spoke to some realities that we can not ignore when he said that the system is broken for a lot of us across Kentucky. ” “ Now when he said he was going to make it better , he was exploiting fears , he was weaponizing pain , '' Booker added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorsement — currently seen as the biggest prize in Kentucky politics . Trump announced his support for Paul 's reelection last year , saying the senator “ fights against the Swamp in Washington. ” Paul 's support for a more restrained foreign policy helped him forge a close relationship with Trump , who bested him for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016 . It leaves Democrats positioned as longshots in yet another Senate race in Kentucky — but maybe Booker can take comfort from the fact that an 80-1 shot just won the @ @ @ """"""",0

"Immigration from poor countries has a perverse effect on the rich. Instead of working out, through observation and experience, how to address the poverty and violence which convulses so many developing nations, the preferred response is a mixture of moral posturing and ignorant prejudice. Sir Paul Collier, an Oxford professor, stands out for his clear thinking on this and for his unwearying advocacy of change. His work, and his pleas for a reform of how we confront this increasingly perilous matter, ought to be better attended. In 2015, Angela Merkel, then Chancellor of Germany, decided—without consultation—to open Germany to migrants. Around a million came, mainly from Syria: a huge, rapid shift in a country where immigration had been moderate. The largest German minority had been Turks, attracted to work in Germany’s large manufacturing sector, and in most cases, they had been in the country for decades. Merkel was applauded by liberals everywhere for her generosity of spirit, yet her gesture was, more quietly but at times venomously, resented by her neighbours, who believed she had left them to cope with the consequences of a policy that had made Europe an even greater attraction to immigrants than before. Inside Germany, the legacy of Merkel’s decision became clearer, albeit with a time lag. In the latest Politico poll, the far-right party, the Alernativ für Deutschland (AfD), is now running ahead of the ruling Social Democrats, second only to the centre-right coalition, the CDU/CSU. The AfD’s success has grown in a few years from a gathering of conservative economists to one of the most successful populist parties in Europe, and it now drives wedges within the centre right. Friedrich Merz, the CDU leader, broke the strict cordon sanitaire between the AfD and the centrist and left-wing parties when he countenanced the possibility of collaboration with the upstart group at regional and local levels, especially in the east of Germany, where it is the dominant force.",0

As Biden faces concerns, including from voters in his own party, about his prospects in a grueling reelection campaign, a new generation of high-profile Democrats are fanning out for the 80-year-old president. Those close to the ambitious Democrats insist they are focused squarely on the 2024 campaign when Biden may face a tough rematch against Donald Trump.",0

"Review of Eurowhiteness: Culture, Empire and Race in the European Project by Hans Kundnani (Hurst Publishers) “When Germany took over the six-month presidency of the [European Union] in 2020, it chose the slogan ‘Making Europe strong again together,’” Hans Kundnani tells us in his new book, Eurowhiteness. “The German government had therefore adopted the Trump administration’s slogan of ‘Make America Great Again’ but, because it now applied to a region rather than a nation, imagined that this would transform its meaning into the opposite of that signified by Trump.” Indeed, the EU’s supporters often like to claim that the continental bloc is an antidote to nationalism. But Kundnani sees it as something else: a project mutating into a regional polity based on a civilizational identity. This regionalism is not entirely new, drawing on both modern and premodern myths of European cultural homogeneity and racial superiority. But it signals a departure from the postwar civic project — a turn that has accelerated in the last couple of decades, particularly since the Eurozone crisis and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kundnani labels this new, disturbing, political form “Eurowhiteness.” Crucially, he argues that Eurowhiteness is bolstered not only by the usual suspects of right-wing populism but also a political center that has co-opted its rhetoric, defending a “Christian Europe” or a European “way of life” against outsiders, whether Muslim, Russian, or from countries on Europe’s borders. Each bolsters the other: just as many confirmed pro-Europeans are willing to work with far-right parties, from Warsaw to Rome, these latter have also taken up pro-Europeanism in their identity posturing against the non-European. Kundnani deftly bursts the bubble of those who idealize the EU as a cosmopolitan project — one much-inflated by intellectuals such as Jürgen Habermas, even as they target the bloc’s democratic deficit and neoliberal political economy. Rather, European regionalism has come to resemble a nationalism “writ large,” which replicates the worst aspects of national chauvinism, exclusivity, and hard borders, but without the mitigating factors of a social project or the democratic structures to fulfill it. Indeed, the traditional contrasting of the EU’s openness with a specific history of (German) nationalism, which sees nationalism only as leading to war and occludes its emancipatory backstory, is part of the problem. Kundnani deftly bursts the bubble of those who idealize the EU as a cosmopolitan project. Deepening his critique of the EU’s sham cosmopolitanism, Kundnani diagnoses its underlying cause: the neoliberalization of the EU has hollowed out domestic democracy, leaving only the simulacra of identity politics in its wake. Building on powerful existing critiques of the EU’s democratic legitimacy, Kundnani connects de-politicization to a renewal of more troubling political forms based on culture and ethnicity, in a word, based on “whiteness” as a common unifier. As the promise of a civic, democratic Europe has receded, so “Eurowhiteness” has taken its place. Civilizing Missions What kind of a substitution is this? What connects “Eurowhiteness” to the EU’s democratic deficit? Kundnani outlines the long and evolving history of European “civilizing missions.” When medieval ideas of Christendom were replaced — gradually and far from completely — with the modernizing ideology of the Enlightenment and its racial notions of Europe, which retained, and in many ways exaggerated, premodern features of exclusivity and superiority, “whiteness” became synonymous with “civilized.” This in turn was used to justify imperial expansion and then scientific racism and eugenics. This dark aspect of European identity, which peaked in the interwar period, was never fully exorcised. But Kundnani implies that there was a postwar period in which a civic rather than civilizational ethos prevailed, which valued democracy, the rule of law, and a social market economy. According to Kundnani, this peaked “between the loss of European colonies in the 1960s and the beginning of the euro crisis in 2010.” With neoliberalism’s ascendency in the 1980s and ’90s, turbo-charged into the new millennium and the financial crisis, this civic ethos waned as ethnic-civilizational ideas were restored. Kundnani is careful not to dismiss the Enlightenment entirely. Nor does he suffer from nostalgia for a postwar golden age. In fact, he suggests that social democracy concealed rather than healed the limits of European inclusiveness. But this means that some work is required to draw out the connections between “Eurowhiteness” and political democracy. Europeanist sentiment also reflected interwar anxiety about the decline of European civilization in the face of growing US and Russian geopolitical power. The crucial hinge is the period between the two World Wars. Kundnani himself evokes some of its salient features. It was then, he notes, that the arguments of pro-European federalist movements first emerged. From the perspective of the Great Powers, Europe’s various individual nationalisms had become an obstacle to European greatness, foreclosing its destiny to rule the world on behalf of humanity. For the aristocrats of the Pan-European movement, personified in the figure of Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, nationalism had become “the gravedigger of European civilization” and needed to be overcome. Europeanist sentiment also reflected interwar anxiety about the decline of European civilization in the face of growing US and Russian geopolitical power. In this era, Carl Schmitt theorized the idea of a German Mitteleuropa based on Catholicism and anti-communism as an antidote to civilizational decline, a trope shared by many on the political right. Conservative counterrevolutionaries such as Oswald Spengler, whose Decline of the West was first published in 1918, envisaged civilizations as biological entities that would naturally rise and fall. For a successful Pan-Europeanism to materialize, Africa would be essential in providing a source of raw materials and physical space for cooperative exploitation of European nations rather than the competitive imperialism that had culminated in World War I. This neo-imperial modernization project was captured in the label “Eurafrica.” Aside from the European federalist arguments circulating among resistance movements, defeated, or tamed in the immediate aftermath of 1945, such ideas were often based on a sense of European superiority. Pan-Europeanism morphed into a more defensive attitude in light of Cold War recognition of Europe’s relative geopolitical weakness, exacerbated by decolonization. It would then become an article of faith for left-wing parties, with Eurocommunists and social democrats alike believing in Europe as the only path to socialism. Whether in the guise of lesser-evilism in comparison to the nation-state, a scalarist eschatology bolstered by Commission president Jacques Delors’s promise of “social Europe,” or a more general technocratic thrust, Europeanism led the Left down a maze of blind alleys. At the end of the twentieth century, Europeanism comes to take more diluted forms, but Europe would be proclaimed as a model for the nations of the world by liberals in awe of its soft power and apparent political stability. We can hear the echoes of this sentiment in those who claim that membership of the EU is essential to maintain global influence or at least to stem its loss. But in each of these cases, from the beginning to the present day, “the European project was not just about peace, as post war ‘pro-Europeans’ would often later claim. It was, always, also about power.” Kundnani gives short shrift to peace-project Messianism, not least given the violence perpetuated by core European states after World War II, notably by France in its brutal suppression of Algerian independence and war in Indochina. With the end of the “European era” of public international law signaled by the new geopolitics of the Cold War, European integration in the imperial center can be understood as the reflex of decolonization in the imperial periphery. As France became more anxious about its colonies, it turned toward European integration in an attempt to maintain its geopolitical status. French and Belgian colonial possessions were included as part of the Common Market, albeit with restrictions on labor migration, a forerunner to the Eastern enlargement program several decades later. As Kundnani shows, Europe, despite its self-image and rhetoric, made no clean break with its late-nineteenth-century “civilizing” mission. It retained it in variation, based on a conviction that it had fully learned the lessons of history. The Holocaust would play a key role, Europe’s “memory culture” becoming inward-looking and parochial, emphasizing acts of cruelty within, while neglecting those performed without. Fascism was presented as an exceptional stain on an otherwise untainted biography, instead of inexorably rooted in its history of colonialism, as Hannah Arendt had argued, or as part of European civilization, as Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer had suggested. Yet in a parallel way, Nazism would also come be seen as unexceptional, conflated with a generic totalitarianism that incorporated Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union. European regionalism has come to resemble a nationalism ‘writ large,’ which replicates the worst aspects of national chauvinism, exclusivity, and hard borders, but without the mitigating factors of a social project. The postwar EU thus became, in Kundnani’s words, a “vehicle of imperial amnesia.” But he is careful not to view it only in relation to this dimension. It also, he argues, became a “technocratic mission.” This is key, and it leads to asking whether a technocratic mindset is compatible with a civic democratic mission at all. Kundnani considers “the depoliticised mode of governance embodied by the EU,” along with the postwar social market economy and welfare state, as an element of civic rule. That he harbors his own doubts about this is later revealed when he considers the antidote to ethnic regionalism to be a “repoliticization of economic policy,” in order to reverse the civilizational turn in the European project. In other words, a civic Europe must be one in which politics is returned to its rightful and primary place. When did such a Europe exist?",0

Nelson , though , pointed to documents obtained from Fox that “ talks about the daily editorial meeting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives that we ’ re looking at right now. ” Judge Davis , meanwhile , noted that Dominion ’ s allegation is “ Fox sought to profit off a lie ” and whether it 's true or not , “ we ’ ll stay for the trial. ” The trial is scheduled to begin in April .

Malhotra cited an example of biased data reporting : “ In September 2021 , the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization ( JCVI ) made a controversial recommendation that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is marginally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA , the UK ’ s equivalent of the FDA ) had previously stated in June 2021 that : “ They have carefully reviewed clinical trial data for the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine in over 2,000 children aged 12–15 years of age and have concluded that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh any risk and that it is effective and acceptably safe in this age group … No new side effects were identified and the safety data in children was comparable to that seen in young adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , the majority of adverse events were mild to moderate , relating to reactogenicity ( e.g . sore arm and tiredness ) . ” Despite consistent reports of safety , an award winning investigative science journalist Dr. Maryanne Demasi a few months later published a disturbing story on Maddie De Garay , a 12-year-old participant in one of the trials . After experiencing severe abdominal pain followed by seizures she was admitted to hospital and is now left permanently disabled , wheelchair-bound , and fed through a nasogastric tube . In Pfizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect as mild : stomach upset . Is this in keeping with the totality of the evidence ? Malhotra wrote that while the risk of death from COVID-19 is close to zero at 1 in 76,000 , “ there is no high-quality data in children that the vaccine will prevent infection , transmission , serious illness or death but may come with serious side effects of myocarditis–particularly in young males where it occurs in up to 1 in 2,700–and serious disability. ” “ It is instructive to note that the greater the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less likely the research findings are to be true , ” Malhotra warned . Given that Bill Gates has disclosed that vaccines give a 20 to 1 profit return—a highly significant profit margin—the one-sided medical findings on vaccine benefits that persist to today are therefore hardly surprising . “ The drug companies have a fiduciary obligation to deliver profits to their shareholders , not any legal responsibility to provide you with the best treatment. ” Over the many decades of lawsuits and studies that found the pharmaceutical industry hide , ignore , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical literature distorted and misrepresented for profits , public and professional trust of medical research have been in “ a growing crisis , ” Malhotra noted . It is hardly surprising that a report by the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2017 showed that 82 percent of GPs and 63 percent of the public did not believe the results of pharmaceutical industry-sponsored research to be unbiased ( pdf ) . Between 2003 to 2016 , the top 11 pharmaceutical companies paid $ 28.8 billion in fines just within the United States , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminal activity included illegal marketing of drugs , manipulation of results and hiding data on harms . No systemic changes have been made to mitigate these harms since then , reported the BMJ . The bigger problem with healthcare is that the very policymakers , doctors , academic institutions , and medical journals responsible for patients and scientific integrity often collude with the pharmaceutical industry for financial gain , Dr. Peter Wilmshurst presented on a talk at the Center of Evidence Based Medicine in Oxford in 2014 . A 2009 study analyzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondents from higher education institutions found that 14 percent admitted to knowing a colleague who fabricated , falsified , and modified data , and 34 percent of the researchers admitted questionable research practices ( pdf ) . This included selective reporting of clinical outcomes in published research and concealing conflicts of interest . “ One researcher at a prestigious UK institution contacted me to inform me that in his cardiology department , a group of academics were deliberately suppressing research that revealed that the mRNA vaccine was shown to significantly increase coronary risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the unvaccinated , ” Malhotra wrote . “ The chair of the group expressed concerns that publishing the data may result in loss of funding from the pharmaceutical industry . After I had alluded to this on GB News , the whistle-blower informed me that non-disclosure agreement letters were sent to all members of the team involved in this particular area of research. ” Health authorities want the public to “ trust the science , ” but vaccine manufacturers have negotiated deals with several major governments globally keeping them safe from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm . This has undoubtedly harmed the public ’ s trust in healthcare . India was one of the few democratic countries that refused to grant Pfizer indemnity from harms for its vaccine . An Indian government source told Reuters that : “ The whole problem with Pfizer is the indemnity bond . Why should we sign it ? If something happens , a patient dies , we will not be able to question them [ Pfizer ] . If somebody challenges [ it ] in a court of law , the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the company. ” Rather than taking a local safety and immunogenicity study , Pfizer withdrew its emergency use authorization for the COVID-19 vaccine in India . India , a densely populated developing country , focused on early treatment rather than vaccination . The country managed to keep the number of deaths to 528,629 out of a 1.38 billion population . The death rate in India from COVID-19 is less than four deaths per 10,000 people . Contrast that to the United States , a developed country where 68 percent of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a million deaths ( 1,084,282 ) out of 329.5 million people . This is equivalent to 32 deaths per 10,000 people , more than eight times the death rates of India . Despite the contradictory data on COVID-19 vaccines ’ abilities to control morbidities and transmissions , neither the world ’ s leading drug regulators nor the vaccine manufacturers have made the raw data for the pivotal trials public for independent scrutiny . Malhotra highlighted the importance of the raw data not being publicized for independent scrutiny . “ Because historically when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this data , then it can completely overturn the conclusion of the published trials. ” An example Malhotra cited is Tamiflu : the clinical case reports for Tamiflu ultimately showed that the drug was no more effective than paracetamol for influenza and also came with small but significant harms including nausea , vomiting , and headaches . Yet , why was the drug approved ? Most of the drug regulators in the Western countries receive over half of their funding from the pharmaceutical industry—the industry they are supposed to be regulating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding from the pharmaceutical industry , MHRA ( UK ) receives 86 percent and the TGA ( Australia ) receives 96 percent of its funding from the pharmaceutical industry . Drug regulators are dependent on the pharmaceutical industry ; the FDA for example , mainly receives its funding from drug manufacturers through user fees . Malhotra cited Pfizer ’ s payments as an example : as part of the approval process for its COVID-19 vaccine , Pfizer made a wire transfer to the FDA of $ 2,875,842 in May 2021 under the Prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pdf ) . Three months later , in August , the FDA fully approved Pfizer as the first COVID-19 vaccine . Both Malhotra and the award-winning investigative journalist Dr. Maryanne Demasi argued that drug regulators ’ dependence on the drug industry was “ institutional corruption , ” of their own . Demasi ’ s report published in June found that Australia ’ s Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) , which is practically exclusively funded by the drug industry alone , approved 94 percent of all applications from 2020 to 2021 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approves 69 percent or 29 percent , depending on the center being evaluated . Both the TGA and the FDA are mostly untransparent in their drug approval process . Demasi filed for FOIA reports to get disclosures on the TGA committee members who had conflicts of interest in their approval of the mRNA vaccines , but the TGA redacted the identity of these members , highlighting that it was personal information . The FDA was sued in September 2021 by over 80 doctors and researchers to make the Pfizer injection data public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court judge to allow the agency 55 years to release this data . “ Why would the FDA— ’ which is responsible for the oversight of more than $ 2.7 trillion in consumption of food , medical products and tobacco ’ —do this ? Secrecy should never surround any public health intervention , ” Malhotra wrote . As former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine Dr. Marcia Angell previously pointed out the real battle in healthcare is one of “ truth versus money. ” COVID-19 policies were probably the most illustrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to shape preferences and frame the dominant narratives on the determinants of health , through unchecked invisible power . One pathway is through the ownership of mass media , ” wrote Malhotra . The global media market is highly monopolized , dominated by seven corporations and chains that own 80 percent of newspapers in the United States . To give an example , The Vanguard Group , which holds the most shares in the New York Times of 9.54 percent also holds the most shares in Pfizer ( 8.29 percent ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nash Holdings LLC , a company controlled by Jeff Bezos , the CEO of Amazon . Amazon has been in partnerships with AstraZeneca and Pfizer since the pandemic . The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , for example , has donated millions to the BBC , the Guardian , CNN , and many others . “ Control over advertising in print and broadcast media also has an influence over editorial decisions . Most health journalists ( including a number I have spoken to ) are generally unaware that the information they obtain for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private interests of manufacturers and ‘ research ’ universities , ” wrote Malhotra . Social media platforms continue to spread misinformation , deplatforming users and removing posts that critique the mainstream COVID-19 messaging . Facebook even labeled the BMJ ’ s investigation into potential fraud in Pfizer ’ s pivotal trial as misinformation and stopped users from sharing the report on the platform . “ Rather than investing a proportion of Meta ’ s substantial profits to help ensure the accuracy of medical information shared through social media , you apparently delegated responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial task , ” the BMJ ’ s current and former editors in chief wrote to Mark Zuckerberg . Similarly , doctors who post studies on Twitter have routinely had their posts flagged for spreading “ misinformation. ” Dr. Tracey Høeg , a physical medicine , rehabilitation physician , and with a PhD in epidemiology , said she was routinely censored by Facebook and Twitter . She has since stopped posting on Facebook , but in June 2021 Høeg posted a tweet of CDC ’ s own presentation slides . She commented that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adverse effect reporting rates of myocarditis on VAERS was already higher than previous years . Within seconds , Twitter flagged her tweet as “ misleading , ” to which Høeg wrote “ I ’ m quoting the CDC ’ s own slides. ” The censorship is not on social media alone , but has also extended to medical publishing . Many researchers , including Dr. Stephanie Seneff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and Dr. Jean-Claude Perez , have disclosed the difficulty of publishing their studies that may critique the risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical care specialist Dr. Pierre Kory on Sept. 10 at a “ Reclaiming Medicine ” conference said that many peer-reviewed studies that show statistical benefits of alternative COVID-19 treatments including ivermectin were retracted without explanation . One study ( pdf ) reviewing the benefits of ivermectin , authored by the 2015 Nobel laureate Dr. Satoshi Ohmura , was also taken down . Ohmura was awarded one quarter of the 2015 Nobel prize for finding ivermectin ’ s uses in treating river blindness and elephantiasis . This in recent years has exacerbated public distrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passports , and little mainstream coverage of “ an unprecedented scale of reported vaccine harms in the population , ” wrote Malhotra . The public has felt the effects . In the United States , adult influenza vaccination uptake has fallen in states that saw lower COVID-19 injection rates , “ in the UK MMR vaccination rates have hit their lowest for 10 years. ” Malhotra wrote that COVID-19 was a failure of public messaging and policies to help individuals prevent COVID-19 harms by improving their health . After age , the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been obesity and metabolic conditions related to excess body fat . “ More than 90 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 occurred in countries where more than 50 percent of the population is overweight or obese , ” Malhotra wrote . However , this prominent opportunity to educate people on simple lifestyle changes was not addressed , and deaths from COVID-19 between the immune compromised and those who were healthy were all blanketed as COVID-19 deaths , driving public fear in a disease that was largely exaggerated . It ’ s a costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not difficult . While a non-smoking man in his mid-50s with a normal body mass index and doing adequate levels of physical exercise has a 1 in 1,521 chance of hospitalization after contracting COVID-19 , in obese , smoking , and sedentary people , this risk rose to 1 in 327 . “ [ Health authorities ] could have made the public aware that reversal of metabolic syndrome has been shown to occur in up to 50 percent of patients–independent of weight loss–within four weeks of dietary changes alone , ” Malhotra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood glucose reading in non-diabetics admitted to hospital has been shown to be associated with worse outcomes , ” Malhotra wrote . “ There was never any evidence justifying any COVID-19 vaccine mandates , passports , or any of the other coercive measures adopted by various governments worldwide , ” Malhotra wrote . He wrote that doctors should have informed patients that their absolute risk reductions for COVID-19 infections was only around 0.84 percent , or 1 in 119 , and this calculation was based on untransparent data , and that this level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months , as part of ethical practice . “ The unprecedented roll-out of an emergency use authorization vaccine without access to the raw data , with increasing evidence of significant harms , compounded by mandates that appear to serve no purpose other than to bolster profits of the drug industry , have highlighted modern medicine ’ s worst failings on an epic scale , with additional catastrophic harms to trust in public health , ” Malhotra concluded . He argued that the failure of the public health response in COVID-19 must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system to produce better doctors , better decision making , healthier patients and restore trust in medicine and public health. ” “ Until all the raw data on the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been independently analyzed , any claims purporting that they confer a net benefit to humankind can not be considered to be evidence-based. ” Views expressed in this article are the opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times .

"There will be a parliamentary election next month in Poland. On 15 October, the incumbent Prawo i Sprawiedliwo?? (PiS, or the Law and Justice Party), headed up by Jaros?aw Kaczy?ski, will be seeking its third consecutive term in government. It won’t be easy. PiS faces a significant challenge from the liberal opposition. No doubt, mainstream media in the West will tell their audiences that democracy itself is at stake in these elections. And they will rehearse a familiar set of accusations against the PiS government, claiming that it’s ‘destroying democracy’, ‘violating the rule of law’, ‘persecuting minorities’ and ‘demonising migrants’. Yet while the New York Times, Guardian, Der Spiegel and the rest make plenty of big claims about PiS, they will be light on the details. For example, they won’t mention that PiS’s so-called attack on the independent judiciary can also be interpreted as a reform designed to bring the Polish courts into line with their French or German counterparts. The Polish government wants to be able to exert a degree of influence over the judges’ nomination process so as to limit the power of an unaccountable caste of lawyers. Which is essentially what happens in France and Germany, too. Likewise, Western media will eagerly talk of the threat the PiS government poses to democracy. But they won’t go into any substantial detail as to what this threat entails. And there is a good reason for this. Because in reality, democracy in Poland has rarely been healthier. Compare the situation in Poland with that of other liberal democracies. ‘If elections could change anything, they would have been banned long ago’ – that saying captures well people’s sense that mainstream parties in Germany or France have become far too similar to each other.

"Now 73 years old and facing an indictment for corruption, Benjamin Netanyahu returned to the residence of the Prime Minister of Israel on Balfour Street in Jerusalem late last year, the only place where he can seek refuge from serving a prison sentence if convicted. “Everything but the cell” could well have been his motto when he spent a year and a half in the opposition. After being ousted from power in June 2021 with the votes of two of his conservative political protegees in 2023, at the head of the most conservative government in the history of the State of Israel, he has faced a protest movement with few precedents against the judicial reform he has imposed, again in an attempt to avoid prison. After the fiasco of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Israelis forced Labor Prime Minister Golda Meir out of power. And four years later, an electoral upset ended the hegemony of the left, as Netanyahu’s Likud party came to power for the first time since the birth of the Jewish state three decades earlier. “Netanyahu’s political exit is inevitable,” predicts Ami Yaalon, former head of the Shabak, the state’s internal security service. Anshel Pfeffer, Netanyahu’s biographer, noted this week in his column in the daily Haaretz that if the prime minister does not set clear goals for the war against Hamas, he will have to face the consequences. In one of the first polls published after the outbreak of the conflict in Gaza, Netanyahu is seen as responsible for the offensive carried out by Hamas, according to a Dialogue Center survey.",0
""""""" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that Russia will continue its “ military operation ” in Ukraine even if a peace deal is made until the process of “ demilitarization ” and “ de-Nazification ” is completed to Moscow ’ s satisfaction and Ukraine is stripped of weapons of mass destruction – including chemical and biological weapons he accused the United States of developing on Ukrainian soil . “ Demilitarization , in the sense of destroying the military infrastructure that threatens us , will be brought to an end , even if we sign a peace agreement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clause , ” Lavrov said from Moscow in an internationally televised interview . Lavrov began with a rambling speech about the U.S. supposedly using Ukraine in a bid to conquer Europe , similar to those of Napoleon and Hitler , and claimed Russia was invading Ukraine with murderous force to liberate Ukrainians from American and European Union domination so they could chart their own destiny .

""""""" Well , liberals have managed to ruin fun once again , which is something they have become exceedingly good at over the last twenty years or so . So , whose parade have they rained on this time ? Thanks to a sweeping gun control law , a yearly Civil War reenactment that is held in a small town known as Angelica , located in the western part of New York , has been cancelled . You know , this is such a simple issue to solve . If only we took the Constitution seriously . It clearly states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that such a right shall not be infringed . Boom . Done . Gun control is not constitutional , even in just a simple plain reading . Dump it in the garbage and let ’ s get back to it . Unfortunately , liberals are doing everything in their power to destroy the Second Amendment and ensure the populace is unarmed , which makes them perfect targets for a hostile takeover by oppressive governmental forces . Okay , so let ’ s get back on track . Sorry about the rant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancelled reenactment from TheBlaze : “ The new firearms law passed by the State of New York and effective September 1st changed more than the handgun permit requirements . Also added are prohibitions against possession of many types of firearms in ‘ sensitive locations ’ which include streets , sidewalks , parks and most public locations , ” the event organizers went on to say in a post on Facebook published on Sept. 4 . “ Black powder weapons are not excepted from this ban . Possession of a firearm in public is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . “ After obtaining a legal opinion , it was determined that we could not continue with holding the event this year . Participants could be subject to arrest . So , the event is canceled this year . If the law is modified or overturned , we hope to return in the future , ” they stated . Under the law signed by Gov . Kathy Hochul ( D ) on July 1 , so-called “ sensitive areas ” include all public parks with few exceptions , airports , houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private property except where the owners have posted signage permitting lawful gun owners to carry their firearms . There are limited exemptions for current and retired law enforcement , peace officers , licensed security guards , active-duty military personnel , hunters , and some government employees . The statute is broad and does not contain exemptions for ceremonial purposes , like Memorial Day or Veterans Day parades , or historical demonstrations like Civil War reenactments . The Allegheny Highlands Council of Scouts BSA , which helps run the event , has offered refunds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered to participate , the Olean Times Herald reported . State Sen. George Borrello , a Republican who is the representative for the southwestern corner of New York , tore into the gun control law in a statement he penned and sent on to the paper . “ This is what happens when you draft legislation designed to punish people you perceive as your enemies without thinking of the consequences , ” Borrello ranted . “ It ’ s symbolic of the total dysfunction one-party rule has created in Albany . For nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has entertained and educated school children and adults about the pivotal role our region had in preserving the Union and ending slavery. ” The state congressman continued to spit total fire by going on to say , “ Every year the event draws hundreds of Civil War reenactors and thousands of spectators to Angelica . Now , due to Gov . Hochul ’ s misnamed , misguided and unconstitutional ‘ Concealed Carry Improvement Act ’ the reenactment is canceled. ” “ This law does nothing to protect New Yorkers from the scourge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our state since the majority in the Legislature and former Gov . Cuomo ended cash bail for most criminal offenses , ” Borrello added in his statement . “ Rather , it is aimed squarely at punishing law-aiding gun owners .

"Review of The Destruction of Reason by Georg Lukács (Verso, 2021) When Fascism came into power, most people were unprepared, both theoretically and practically. They were unable to believe that man could exhibit such propensities for evil, such lust for power, such disregard for the rights of the weak, or such yearning for submission. Only a few had been aware of the rumbling of the volcano preceding the outbreak. —Erich Fromm, Escape From Freedom The wave of right-wing populist victories that kicked off in 2016 surprised many of us. I’ll never forget hosting an election watch party with my friends, talking about how the incoming Hillary Clinton administration’s inevitable doubling down on neoliberalism would require a stiff response. We all know what happened next. By 2018, virtually every major country on Earth was governed by a hard-right or hard-right-sympathetic government — the United States, Israel, India, Russia, Brazil, Italy, Britain, Turkey, Poland, and Hungary only being the most well known. While a rare-but-predictable combination of cruelty and incompetence led to the ouster of right-wing presidents in the United States, Brazil, and elsewhere, the future is unpredictably open in a way few could have predicted in the “end of history” era. One upside of unforeseen historical events is that the inevitable soul-searching that results helps the Left recover insights that may have been forgotten. There has been, for instance, a surge of left-wing scholarly and activist interest in the intellectual right — such that many liberals and leftists are now as familiar with the ins and outs of “fusionism” and the distinction between postliberals and national conservatives as they are with the revolution/reform debate. There is the well-loved Know Your Enemy podcast, an array of scholarly and popular books by left-liberals and socialists (including yours truly), and a dizzying array of long-form explainers and critiques from journalists like John Ganz, Kathryn Joyce, and Rick Perlstein. Lukács’s The Destruction of Reason This resurgence has included the reintroduction of texts by classic leftist authors on conservatism, fascism, and the Right generally. In 2021, Verso stepped into the fray with new edition of Georg Lukács’s The Destruction of Reason. Lukács, one of the founding figures of “Western” Marxism, is best known for his strongly Hegelian development of Marxist philosophy in History and Class Consciousness. By contrast with that comparatively svelte collection of essays, The Destruction of Reason has to stand with Domenico Losurdo’s equally girthy Nietzsche, the Aristocratic Rebel as one of the most voluminous analyses of the Right by a major Marxist thinker. But where Losurdo’s book is laser-focused on Friedrich Nietzsche’s enduring influence on the hard right, Lukács’s nine-hundred-page behemoth surveys huge swaths of reactionary and right-adjacent thinking, from the German idealists through Arthur Schopenhauer and Søren Kierkegaard to Martin Heidegger and Carl Schmitt, as well as a host of lesser-known and intellectually vapid toadies for fascism and Nazism. Originally published in 1952, Lukács’s The Destruction of Reason was intended to chart ‘Germany’s path to Hitler in the sphere of philosophy.’ Originally published in 1952, Lukács’s book was intended to chart “Germany’s path to Hitler in the sphere of philosophy.” In some respects, this is an odd task for a resolutely orthodox Marxist to take on. From the standpoint of classical Marxism, the kinds of ideological struggles taking place in the “sphere of philosophy” are largely supposed to be secondary fronts. They reflect in the “superstructure” changes and conflicts in the economic “base,” with the implication that debates in philosophy have minor causal relevance, if any, for major social changes. Lukács himself often gestures in the direction of this more orthodox view, stressing that he is “confining” himself to “portraying the most abstract part” of the rise of Adolf Hitler and by no means intends to imply “an overestimation of philosophy’s importance in the turbulent totality of concrete developments.” This Marxist humility is quite refreshing, given the sheer volume of books by philosophers like Heidegger that suggest complicated historical developments are best explained by shifts in our metaphysical views. But it also means that Lukács sometimes leans on unconvincing ultra-Marxist assertions that, whatever a philosopher may have thought, what was really going on was a kind of class struggle carried over into epistemological or ontological doctrines. Lukács is more persuasive when he stresses that, whether or not a philosopher like Wilhelm Dilthey or Henri Bergson intended to have a reactionary impact, their work was taken up that way. To this day, plenty of interesting thinkers have had their work bastardized by far-right opportunists, à la Aleksandr Dugin’s vulgar appeals to postmodern thinkers like Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. But Lukács’s orthodox Marxist approach to the history of reactionary thought ultimately leads to a deeper problem. His consistent construal of anyone as an irrationalist to the extent they don’t conform to his interpretation of materialist dialectics is unconvincing. Lukács’s triumphalist rhetoric about the Soviet Union embodying the apex of rationalist thought doesn’t help his case that anyone who deviates from the orthodox line is regressing into irrationalism — not least because Karl Marx’s own thinking was sufficiently rich to admit of a wide array of creative syntheses. This includes work by liberal, Christian, and Nietzschean authors who have demonstrated the virtues of a syncretic and undoctrinaire approach to Marxism. Indeed, Lukács’s own creative massaging of Marx’s work to bring out Hegelian themes in History and Class Consciousness demonstrates why a little irreverence can go a long way.",0

"Unfortunately for the Biden administration, immigration – a considerable Achilles Heel for the President – figures to be a significant issue in the 2024 presidential election. This is surely an unwelcome development for Biden’s reelection prospects, as the president continues to struggle with balancing voters’ demands for border security with the left’s calls for a more sympathetic immigration policy. To be clear, while the economy and inflation will surely be the top priorities when voters go to the polls next November, immigration will not be far behind. In fact, roughly one-quarter (24%) of registered voters say immigration is the most important issue facing the country, just slightly lower than those saying the economy (26%), and inflation (34%) – the top concern – according to a recent Harvard-Harris poll. Moreover, immigration is one of Biden’s biggest vulnerabilities. Only 31% of Americans – including 27% of Independents – approve of how Biden has handled immigration. Comparatively, nearly 4-in-10 (37%) Americans approve of the president’s handling of the economy, per Gallup polling.",0

"As the leaves begin to turn to autumn colors, the winds of change have picked up at Minnesota United — for the 2023 season, and beyond, as Loons longtime Gaffer Adrian Heath was dismissed this week as the coach of Minnesota United FC. While it brings no joy to see any coach dismissed from managing his team, Heath’s departure holds a bit more weight than most as he was the one and only head man to command the sidelines in the club’s 7-year run in Major League Soccer. But, on this Saturday evening in October it would be longtime assistant Sean McAuley stepping up to the task that lay ahead of the Loons: claiming a crucial three points to stay in the playoff hunt in the logjam that is the Western Conference. Well, that, and making it one hell of a Fan Appreciation Night for the last home match at Allianz Field in the regular schedule. And, leave it to the finest Finn on the field to turn it into a party, as Teemu Pukki would have a club record 4 goals to lead the Loons over the Galaxy by a gaudy scoreline of 5-2. With both squads entering with playoff hopes still alive, this one would be an action-packed affair, with much of the excitement provided by a Loons side desperately in need of the win at home, where they haven’t found positive results recently. But, points wouldn’t be a problem on Saturday night, thanks to an offensive onslaught from the home side. Hassani Dotson kicked off the scoring in the 33rd minute of the first half, after Bongokhule Hlongwane connected from the wing with Dotson in the dead-center of the box, who would find the net to make it 1-0, Loons. While the Galaxy would bring things level after LA midfielder Tyler Boyd’s shot found the net in the 41st minute, Pukki would give the home crowd just a sample of the scoring night to-be before the half. It would be Emanuel Reynoso’s forward lob pass that landed in front of the striker, who went on to shoot just hard enough to get by the hand of LA keeper Jonathan Bond and roll over the line to head into the locker room with a 2-1 lead. But, would those good vibes transfer over to the second half?",0
"When 47 heads of state and government converge at Granada this Thursday for the third meeting of the so-called European Political Community, expect no Hail Mary on illegal immigration from President Macron, the man who conceived the parley as a way to foster cooperation over canapés and Instagram-worthy scenery.

"Cheeky campaigners last week unfurled a giant mocked-up Labour banner outside the party’s HQ, emblazoning the dour face of Keir Starmer alongside his February 2020 remarks about the need for electoral reform. Starmer lost all interest in the question in the months that followed, and it’s since been a running sore between the party’s leader and its members. There was an overwhelming vote for proportional representation (PR) at last year’s Labour conference, and it’s likely to bubble back up this autumn. I’ve come to the view that the members are right, though not for the reasons most of them think. It would be nice if electoral reform could be approached as a matter of high democratic principle, but the lesson of history is that this never happens. In the early 20th century, Conservatives feared being on the wrong side of a winner-takes-all system under the expanded franchise, and so were often the most prominent proponents of PR. After a Speaker’s Conference in 1917, it nearly came about, too, until it was thwarted the following year by none other than the last Liberal prime minister, Lloyd George. By the mid-1920s, with his seats bleeding away under First-Past-the-Post, the old goat shamelessly swerved to embrace electoral reform, which has been a great Liberal passion ever since.",0

Lambert clearly recognized that the “ flashy and trashy ” characters she was writing about on “ Music City Queen , ” the showbiz misfits who perform on a cheesy tourist showboat on Nashville ’ s Cumberland River , were very much the B-52s ’ kinds of people . Consider Tina , who “ never quite had a Hollywood body , ” but “ makes a damn good lookalike Dolly ” —at which point the B-52s ’ lead carnival barker Fred Schneider pitches in with his unique nasal hoot , “ Whoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence grows as the track goes on , and by the final verse , he ’ s trading lines in a call-and-response with Lambert . It ’ s a delightful climax , although not quite at the level I dreamed of . That may come down to the fact that the band wasn ’ t actually with Lambert in the studio—they Zoomed their parts in , and Lambert wasn ’ t even there at the time . I can ’ t help feeling that Schneider ’ s energy bouncing off hers in-person would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That sense of missed chances applies to Palomino overall . While never truly letting down Lambert ’ s high standards , it ’ s less satisfying than her last several albums . Some of that may be due to the conditions of recording during a pandemic . Lambert produced the album with frequent co-writer/musicians Jon Randall and Luke Dick , the first time she ’ s worked without an outside producer . While I want to cheer on that autonomy , some of the sound here feels like a rough draft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire-crackered out of the speakers , but when the smoke and sweat starts to build on Palomino , it often sounds like it ’ s behind a safety shield . The theme of the album , a focus on road songs—imaginary travels to sate the pandemic-period longing for real ones—may also be to blame for lending it a certain sameness . Not as lusty and snarky as Wildcard nor as wistful as The Weight of These Wings , Palomino seems to land in a middling place even as its songs keep moving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could use a few more dirty , messy , tighter-focused tunes , and few less that restate the I ’ m-a-restless-rambler thesis the way “ Actin ’ Up , ” “ Scenes , ” “ Tourist , ” and “ Pursuit of Happiness ” do . Each of those is fine on its own ; the problem is the pileup . Place names in a song add atmosphere and texture , but they ’ re also opportunities for tour audiences to cheer when they hear a shoutout to a local landmark . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist , humanizing them as someone who could be , if not a neighbor , at least someone who knows the lay of your land . When that trick ’ s played so much on one album , though , the set starts to sound more like a vehicle for that anticipated tour than a destination of its own . Sometimes the concept seems to be driving Lambert instead of the other way around . It ’ s a relief , for example , when an out-of-left-field , gospel-blues cover of a 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit , ” adds some hippie-mystic grandeur to the travelogue theme : “ Trod the pyramids and ruins of Angkor/ And I kissed the Mona Lisa and had breakfast with the King. ” A country album can always use a reminder that , vast as America is , it ain ’ t the world entire . But there are all-time classics on Palomino too . Along with “ If I Was a Cowboy , ” there ’ s “ Strange , ” which extrapolates from the time-out-of-joint feelings of the pandemic to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That What Makes the Jukebox Play , ” a fit addition both to the treasure trove of country songs-about-songs and to Lambert ’ s own stock of closely observed tunes about bars ; and “ Carousel , ” a gorgeous closer worthy of Lambert ’ s songwriting-storytelling heroes Guy Clark and John Prine , a tale of a retired trapeze artist that doubles as Lambert ’ s bittersweet meditation on the inevitable point in life when the spotlight may fade for good : “ Every show must end , every circus leaves town. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are the three dynamic reworkings of songs from last year ’ s underheard , acoustic trio album The Marfa Tapes , recorded under the West Texas stars with Jon Randall and Jack Ingram . The studio augmentation of the beautiful “ In His Arms ” is a welcome reprise . The rocked-up version of “ Geraldine , ” Lambert ’ s update and answer song to Parton ’ s “ Jolene , ” meanwhile , was an absolute necessity . And I ’ m slayed above all by the expansion here of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ” a Lambert masterpiece about wanting to retrace some of life ’ s wrong turns . “ Nobody ever left New Orleans as mad as I was , ” she begins—a hell of a claim when you think about it . But by the middle , Lambert ’ s pleading to a lost love ( personified by the titular Dallas suburb ) , “ I ’ ve got enough gasoline , memories , and nicotine/ Freedom ’ s overrated , guess I underestimated the truth/ And you. ” Alongside Palomino ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful to it for bringing me back to The Marfa Tapes , which I now realize was one of the best records of 2021 . There ’ s a moment in the enchantingly laid-back documentary about its making ( also highly recommended ) where Lambert messes up “ They ’ ve Closed Down the Honky Tonks , ” admitting that she ’ s never been able to get the words down because the pandemic-themed song just hit “ too close to home. ” I think that ’ s how I felt last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted was another stripped-down artifact of isolation . But now , with the world barreling incautiously forward once more , its exquisite understatement feels like an intimate oasis . More than that , Marfa offers a precious glimpse of a world-class diva creating her art off the clock , even off the calendar—or at least creating the illusion of doing so . It ’ s like getting to sit around a campfire with Maria Callas . Lambert can be equally captivating in a stadium , a Vegas thee-ay-ter , an awards show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert porch .

""""""" With about a month before the midterm election , some Republican candidates across the country are scrambling to moderate their position on abortion . Supporting the recent Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women ’ s Health Organization — which overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the constitutional right to abortion — might be a winner in a Republican primary , but early signs are that it makes it harder to win a general election . The conventional wisdom is that that ’ s in part because women are more motivated to vote this election season thanks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom isn ’ t necessarily based on evidence , though . And while abortion is an increasingly important issue for women , there are signs it is galvanizing some men too . If the Dobbs decision were motivating more women than men , then there ’ s a metric where that change would probably show up : the gender gap . The gender gap is calculated by looking at the difference between the share of men and women who voted for a particular candidate or party . A higher share of women than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midterm election since 1980 , and in the past two midterm cycles the gap has been even bigger . The 2018 midterm elections are a good example . That year , according to the exit polls , 59 percent of women — and only 47 percent of men — voted Democratic , which means the gender gap was historically wide , at nearly 12 percentage points . It will be hard to exceed that gap , even with abortion at the forefront of many voters ’ minds . Our analysis of polls conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , women are leaning heavily toward Democrats , while men are more likely to support Republicans . But in our polling average , the gender gap isn ’ t quite as big as it was at this point in 2018 . Of course , the size of the gender gap will vary depending on the poll . We looked at two Pew Research Center polls — one conducted in August 2018 and one in August 2022 — and found that , in contrast with our average , the gender gap for Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2022 ( 6 points ) than it was at the same point in 2018 ( 5 points ) , although it ’ s in the same ballpark . And it is noteworthy that Pew ’ s data says the 2022 gender gap is looking similar to the gap at the same point in 2018 , given that Democrats have more electoral headwinds this year . “ I expect that the [ Supreme Court ] ruling will lead women — especially Gen-Z women — to be far more engaged with the midterms than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Melissa Deckman , the CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute , a nonprofit polling organization . But the gender gap is a measure of one fairly specific thing : how women vote relative to men . And that can be complicated when it comes to abortion , because men and women overall have very similar views on the issue . As we ’ ve written before , whether someone supports or opposes abortion rights has much more to do with their view of gender roles than their own gender . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if left-leaning men are also unusually motivated to turn out , the gender gap could be smaller . A similar dynamic happened in 2020 , when men moved toward President Joe Biden , resulting in a smaller gender gap compared with 2016 . So far , the evidence about how men are responding to the Dobbs ruling is mixed . Over the past few months , polls have found over and over again that rising concern over abortion is most dramatic among women , and reports of surging voter registration have focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political science professor at Rutgers University-Camden , said this makes sense because women — in particular , reproductive-aged women who support legal abortion — are more likely than men to feel personally threatened by the sudden loss of abortion rights . But there have also been reports of higher-than-usual voter registration among young men . An analysis of a series of polls by the nonpartisan firm PerryUndem , shared with FiveThirtyEight , before and after the Dobbs ruling found that men of reproductive age were more likely to prioritize “ safe and legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In our polling average , we found that the gender gap for both Democrats and Republicans grew from June through September , but the gap grew more for Republicans than for Democrats . The two gaps are lopsided because men ’ s share of support for Democrats has grown as well as women ’ s , which means that the full magnitude of the shift doesn ’ t show up in that party ’ s side . Meanwhile , the shift in the Republicans ’ gender gap shows something different : While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t changed meaningfully since June , the share of women supporting Republicans has declined , causing the gap to increase . Daniel Cassino , a professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University , said that abortion-rights opponents might also be fired up by the Dobbs decision — but that ’ s less likely to show up as a change in the polls because those people are a solid part of the Republican base and more likely to vote in midterm elections to begin with . “ This year , motivating those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really help Republicans , because they ’ re already motivated , ” he said . He explained that reports of higher-than-usual voter registration among women and young voters are another complicating factor because it ’ s hard for pollsters to account for unexpected surges in turnout . Young voters tend to have particularly low turnout , and pollsters sometimes rely on how demographic groups have behaved in the past when they create models to determine who ’ s likely to vote and who isn ’ t . If young women are unusually motivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw off pollsters ’ estimates . And then there are all the other factors that influence how people vote . Inflation and the economy are other issues that still consistently show up at the top of voters ’ priority lists , and that ’ s not good for Democrats . Even though the economic outlook has improved in some respects over the past few months , a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll found that only 26 percent of Americans said that Democrats would do a better job handling the economy , while 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . ( An additional 20 percent said that neither party would do a better job , and 12 percent said they ’ d do an equally good job . ) So the question isn ’ t just whether abortion is motivating women more than men — it ’ s whether concern about abortion will lead voters who might be skeptical about the Democratic Party to vote for its candidates anyway . That group includes men as well as women , and their decisions will do a lot to shape how wide or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . """"""",0

""""""" This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form . AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now ! I ’ m Amy Goodman , with Nermeen Shaikh , as we turn to look at the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan . Two hundred troops died earlier this month after Azerbaijan attacked Armenia in the latest round of violence between the two neighbors in the South Caucasus region . The violence appears to have stopped for now , after the two sides agreed to a truce . Earlier this week , Secretary of State Tony Blinken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly . Over the weekend , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Armenia and accused Azerbaijan of initiating the latest round of violence . We ’ re joined now in Yerevan , Armenia ’ s capital , by Roubina Margossian , who reported from the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh , which is at the center of the conflict , a writer and photojournalist for EVN Report . Roubina , welcome back to Democracy Now ! Can you explain what happened and whether you think this truce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may not be focused on this conflict right now ? ROUBINA MARGOSSIAN : Thank you for having me . And unfortunately , I ’ m back again . I would say that . Well , what happened is it escalated the situation , and it turned into what it is now , the conflict on the night of the 13th . Well , of course , to explain this , you need to go back and explain what happened in 2020 , and then also explain what happened in the last 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was basically handed over to Azerbaijan because Stalin decided to do so . So , there is definitely territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan , and that ’ s the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict . And Nagorno-Karabakh was part of Azerbaijan during the Soviet Union , as I said , just because Stalin decided to give it away , and then they voted to join Armenia at the last years of the Soviet Union , which was not accepted by the Soviet Union . And , of course , the Soviet Union collapsed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since then , since 2004 , we have basically had a ceasefire , but not a resolution to the conflict . Well , in 2020 , Azerbaijan attacked Nagorno-Karabakh proper , including the seven territories that were around Nagorno-Karabakh that were under Armenian control . So , what we had in the last two years was the November 9 ceasefire — statement that was brokered by Russia , and it was more or less holding . And we saw the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in the Nagorno-Karabakh region . So , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again , just to emphasize , is not Armenia proper or the Republic of Armenia . What we ’ re seeing now is an attack on the sovereign territory of Armenia . This is three regions of Armenia . That ’ s the Gegharkunik region , the Syunik region and the Vayots Dzor region . And on Armenian settlements , well , it can be explained by many that ’ s saying Azerbaijan is not very happy with the outcome of its victory , so Azerbaijan feels there should be more gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you explain why you think Azerbaijan carried out this massive artillery bombardment within Armenia now ? Talk about the significance of this happening now . ROUBINA MARGOSSIAN : Well , the significance of this happening now is , as you know , Armenia and Azerbaijan are discussing a peace deal . And because both Armenia and Azerbaijan were a part of the Soviet Union , the borders between the country — the two countries have not been delimited or there demarked . So , of course , this creates a problem . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized internationally as sovereign states , so there are borders . There definitely are borders . They are just not demarked , which is a normal situation among a lot of countries , right ? So , now Armenia and Azerbaijan are talking about a peace deal . Armenia and Azerbaijan are discussing a five-point proposal that Azerbaijan made . Armenia said OK , but also added a couple of subpoints , from what we understand . And also , in the November 9th agreement , statement , there is talk of opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region , and also between Azerbaijan and its enclave , Nakhchivan , that would be very well connected to Armenia otherwise . So , what Azerbaijan has since tried to interpret the November 9th statement is as Armenia has promised a sovereign corridor to Azerbaijan , which there ’ s no such wording in the statement , which I ’ ve read over and over again , and everyone has read . But as statements go , they are open to interpretation . So , Azerbaijan , the general understanding is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , to pressure Armenia into granting Azerbaijan a corridor . That would be very devastating for Armenia because it would just sever half of the country , and a whole region , the Syunik region , would be cut in half . And technically , Armenia wouldn ’ t have access to that region , which would also technically , given where this road might pass — and Armenia has like adamantly said there will be no such thing as a corridor — it would also jeopardize Armenia ’ s only border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NERMEEN SHAIKH : Roubina , explain what the regional situation is , the fact that Azerbaijan receives massive support from Turkey , both economic as well as military , whereas Armenia was historically a key strategic ally of Russia . How is this playing out ? And the fact that when Pelosi was there , she likened the situation that Armenia is in now to that of Taiwan and Ukraine , do you agree with that ? ROUBINA MARGOSSIAN : Well , definitely , I agree in case of Ukraine , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is that because of Ukraine , the armed conflict in Armenia got recognized . If this had happened prior to Ukraine or Ukraine hadn ’ t happened , there would be very little to no attention to what ’ s happening here . And the bothsidesism that we ’ ve experienced historically from the international community would continue more . What we see now is a little bit more vocal support for Armenia . And that ’ s not for Armenia because of the , you know , country ; it ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the few , if not only , developing democracies . Of course , we have Georgia , but seems like Georgia has stagnated in this sense . And Armenia , despite everything , despite the war two years ago , despite the political situation in the country , is continuing to move forward toward democracy . So , I think this is the one thing that has changed , where Armenia was recognized and valued as a democratic country in this region , that really is in need , dire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it ’ s a basically autocratic region , more or less . AMY GOODMAN : And the fact that Peskov has now weighed in , Roubina , that he rebuked Nancy Pelosi , saying that her “ loud announcements ” aren ’ t helpful , the Kremlin spokesperson , Dmitry Peskov , saying that a “ quiet and businesslike approach ” to the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict will bear fruit — where you think this is headed right now ? ROUBINA MARGOSSIAN : Well , similar comments from Moscow are — very cynical comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very often when situations like this arise . However , it has to be noted that since 2018 , since the regime change in Armenia , Armenia has more of a balanced relationship between east — west and Russia . So , yes , it ’ s very kind of — people perceive Armenia as more Russian-oriented or Russia as the security guarantor of Armenia . But we ’ ve seen that that ’ s not true , and — because this is not the first attack on Armenia ’ s sovereign territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not sure to this extent , in Tavush two years ago , and Armenia did apply to the CSTO and to the agreement , friendship agreement and collaboration agreement it had with Russia since the '90s to send military help or help . And we 've had a — the response was not what CSTO is about . The response is not what is expected , because in the CSTO charter , it says an attack against one member state is an attack against all member states , while what CSTO did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a couple of years ago . This time they said , “ We ’ re sending a fact-finding mission. ” NERMEEN SHAIKH : And finally , Roubina , we just have a minute . If you could comment on that question of Turkey ’ s support for Azerbaijan , effectively against Armenia , and , of course , the history of Turkey and Armenia deeply associated , of course , with the genocide of the Armenian people during World War I ? ROUBINA MARGOSSIAN : Well , Turkey ’ s support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the first war in the '90s for Nagorno-Karabakh , Turkey , it closed off borders with Armenia in support of Azerbaijan . So , as such , it 's not new . It ’ s always been there . It ’ s always been very demonstrative , and it ’ s been very vocal . So , this also , unfortunately , falls in line with this pan-Turkic narrative that Turkey has , especially in recent years , been pushing forward : Azerbaijan and Turkey are two sister countries , brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if you look at the map , Armenia is right in the middle . So , I know this is an exaggeration , and it ’ s not necessarily kind of what ’ s happening right now , but if Armenia didn ’ t exist or Armenia was a weaker state , it would be very easier for Azerbaijan and Turkey to kind of expand their brotherhood .

"Atlanta United 2 earned a shootout victory over Inter Miami CF II Sunday night at Fifth Third Bank Stadium after the match ended in a 3-3 draw. Noah Cobb, Nick Firmino and Kofi Twumasi each scored to help Atlanta United 2 come back from two-goal deficit in the second half to tie the game and earn the extra point in a penalty shootout. Despite the resilient performance, ATL UTD 2 was eliminated from playoff contention. Miami got out to an early lead through Lawson Sunderland in the third minute. After a long buildup from the back, Nykolas Sessock received the ball inside the left edge of the 18-yard-box on a perfectly chipped ball from Alejandro Flores. Sessock headed a pass to Sunderland at the back post for Miami's team captain to power in the goal into the roof of the net. After the goal, Atlanta took control of possession and fired off six of the next eight shots. However, Miami earned a free kick just outside the box when Chris Gloster was called for a hand ball in the 34th minute. Flores' free kick ricocheted off the crossbar and fell to Tyler Hall in front of goal for an easy tap in for Miami.",0
""""""" There is now emerging among congressional Republicans ( at last ) a recognition that ( though they have until recently been every bit as neocon and pro-military-industrial-complex as their Democratic Party colleagues have been and are ) , the best path forward for the Republican Party to again come to hold the reins of power in the U.S. federal Government is for congressional Republicans to declare the war in Ukraine to be a Democratic Party project ( begun , in fact , by Barack Obama , back in February 2014 , and even earlier , starting secretly in 2011 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party of peace , anti-war , and favoring domestic spending instead of spending on foreign countries . So : who , REALLY , have been the leaders in Congress backing the $ 40-billion+ U.S. expenditure to defeat Russia in the battlefields of Ukraine ? On 23 May 2022 , the World Economic Forum at Davos presented the far-right West Virginia Democratic U.S . Senator Joe Manchin saying “ I am totally committed as one person to seeing Ukraine to the end as a win ” against its next-door neighbor Russia , “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treaty ; I don ’ t think that that is where we are and what we should do [ i.e. , ‘ we ’ should instead proxy-wage that war by Ukrainians down to its last Ukrainian corpse — NEVER allow Ukraine to continue to retain U.S. support if Ukraine ’ s government signs “ some type of treaty ” with Russia ] . ” The great international investigative journalist Caitlin Johnstone headlined about it , “ They ’ re Just Outright Telling Us That Peace In Ukraine Is Not An Option ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Ukraine has the determination to do it . We should have the commitment to support it , ” and that he also said this included “ getting rid of Putin. ” So : that ’ s what American taxpayers are now funding , to the tune of $ 40B , this war by Ukrainians , to achieve , for America ’ s billionaires ( who control Lockheed Martin , etc. ) .

All participants supported increasing military spending and slashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defeat Russia on Ukraine ’ s battlefields . At that same time , the independent foreign-affairs journalist Stephen Kinzer , headlined on 26 May 2022 , “ Republicans return to their roots as the antiwar party ” , and he was the earliest to recognize what was then shaping up : Since the Vietnam era , Americans have come to expect antiwar rhetoric from liberal Democrats . Cancel that . With Americans now engulfed in passion for Ukraine , it wasn ’ t surprising that President Biden proposed sending $ 33 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine ’ s beleaguered military . Nor was it surprising that Congress , or that both the Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor . Hidden within that lopsided vote , though , was a shocker : Every single “ no ” vote — 11 in the Senate and 57 in the House — came from a Republican . Since the Vietnam era , Americans have come to expect antiwar rhetoric from liberal Democrats . Cancel that . This month ’ s votes in Washington signal a dramatic role reversal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US involvement in foreign wars .

This now leaves congressional Republicans free to blame ‘ the Democrats ’ if Russia defeats Ukrainians in the battlefields of Ukraine .

"This post is also available in: Spanish Fifty years after the coup d’état of September 1973, beyond the just tributes paid in Chile and around the world to Salvador Allende, we all had the opportunity to observe the tension that this national and global anniversary always produces in the right wing. Although the years that have passed bring us more and more evidence that the overthrow was conceived and organised by Henry Kissinger and the US government under Nixon, curiously enough, this fact was ignored by official events, despite the fact that this time there were forceful acknowledgments from Washington. Especially when the White House unsealed new and conclusive secret documents revealing a number of actions and millionaire contributions from the CIA aimed at destabilising the Popular Unity government in order to install Pinochet in the government of our country after a criminal and terrorist operation. Of course, the current rulers are not available to emphasise the responsibility of US imperialism in dozens of coups d’état on this continent and in the world. Let alone demand that the US masterminds could be sent to our country to be tried as seditionists and murderers. Certainly, it would be too much to request that impunity should not be imposed in this regard so that the current and future US rulers can continue to carry out criminal operations aimed at overthrowing governments of any political persuasion that endangers US interests.",1

""""""" Mayor Adams ’ administration is leaning on the City Council to amend a local law as part of a long-running effort to shift thousands of retired municipal workers into a controversial , cost-cutting Medicare plan — infuriating retirees who maintain that such a switch would wreck their health coverage . The administration ’ s push to enroll the city ’ s roughly 250,000 eligible retirees in a so-called Medicare Advantage Plan was scuttled in March , when Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Lyle Frank struck it down as unlawful . The plan had proposed to slap a $ 191 monthly penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Medicare instead of enrolling in the Advantage plan — and Frank ruled the financial levy violated an administrative law that bars the city from charging its retired workers for health insurance . In a bid to circumvent Frank ’ s decision , the Adams administration last week authorized the issuance of a formal request for the Council to rewrite the law in question so it would become legal for the city to apply monetary penalties on retirees who don ’ t get onboard with its preferred health plan , mayoral spokesman Jonah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Municipal Labor Committee , an umbrella group for the city ’ s largest unions , which voted Thursday to throw its weight behind the request to the Council , according to Harry Nespoli , the committee ’ s chairman . Marianne Pizzitola , a retired FDNY emergency medical specialist who leads the NYC Organization of Public Service Retirees , said her group remains convinced that the Advantage plan is inferior to their current coverage . She said the latest Advantage push from Adams and the unions is “ a slap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a betrayal , ” said Pizzitola , whose group ’ s lawsuit prompted Frank ’ s ruling in March . “ My phone has been going off the hook from retirees asking , ‘ What the hell is going on ? ’ The city made a promise to us that they would have our backs with free health care — that ’ s why many of us came to work here and stayed for 20 , 30 years . How do you take that away from us when we ’ re gone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for them if they ’ re going to harm us when we retire ? ” City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams ( D-Queens ) would not comment on the merits of the request from the mayor and the Municipal Labor Committee , but a spokesman for her said the Council “ wants to be helpful in resolving this issue. ” The joint request from Adams and labor will likely have to go through several committees , where it could face stiff opposition , said a Council member with close ties to the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall is dreaming if they think they can just slip this through , ” the member told the Daily News , speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of angering the mayor . Since former Mayor Bill de Blasio ’ s administration first tried to implement the Advantage plan in the fall of 2021 , Pizzitola ’ s group has contended that it would drastically dilute health coverage for retirees by instituting preauthorization requirements for a slew of medical procedures and services . They ’ ve pointed to an April study from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that found Advantage plans — which , unlike traditional Medicare , are administered by private health insurance providers — can “ prevent or delay beneficiaries from receiving medically necessary care. ” Amid those concerns , nearly 66,000 retired city employees , ranging from cops and firefighters to teachers and sanitation workers , had opted out of the Advantage plan as of July in order to stay on their current coverage , according to city data . But Adams administration officials , joined by municipal labor union brass , have dismissed the complaints from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model would provide the requisite care . In addition , Adams and the unions have stressed that the Advantage plan — thanks in part to its private administration — would save the city upward of $ 600 million a year . At a time when projections show the city could be facing a $ 9.9 billion municipal government budget gap by 2026 , such savings are critical , even if it involves convincing the Council to change a law , said Allon , the mayoral spokesman . “ As Mayor Adams has repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan is in the best interest of retirees and taxpayers , ” Allon said . “ We will continue to work with the Municipal Labor Committee to take all steps to ensure such a plan can be implemented. ” Under the framework envisioned by Adams and the unions , Advantage plan savings would largely be funneled into the city ’ s Health Stabilization Fund , which is used to supplement dental and prescription drug benefits for municipal workers . Due to years of skyrocketing health care costs and other factors , Nespoli , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stabilization fund is in such dire financial straits that it could be at risk of total collapse unless the Advantage savings roll in . “ Without those savings , there ’ s going to be a problem , there ’ s going to be a big , big problem for our members , ” Nespoli said . “ I don ’ t think that the retirees actually understand that. ” Steve Cohen , an attorney who represents the NYC Organization of Public Service Retirees , said Nespoli ’ s argument doesn ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reason the stabilization fund is running dry is because the de Blasio administration used cash from it to bankroll raises for teachers , Cohen said . “ Why should retirees be left to pick up the tab for that ? ” he asked . Cohen also said Adams ’ push for an amendment of the law could have unforeseen consequences beyond Medicare Advantage . “ It opens up a whole new can of worms because that law is the clearest protection for city workers [ to get free health care ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that law , the city could basically take away health care at any time. ” Marcia Biederman , a former city public school teacher who opted out of Advantage , said she was ecstatic when the Manhattan Supreme Court struck down the Adams administration ’ s first attempt at implementing the plan , believing that spelled the end of the matter . “ But it turns out our celebration was premature because now they ’ re trying this , ” Biederman said . “ This really would affect our lives in a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to go against this . ” """"""",0

""""""" A slew of current and former FBI officials are slated to take the stand in a trial set to begin Monday of former Clinton campaign lawyer Micheal Sussmann , offering testimony that could lay bare the FBI ’ s eagerness to seize on unverified anti-Trump political dirt . Special counsel John Durham , who is probing the FBI ’ s handling of the Trump-Russia collusion allegations , has charged Mr. Sussmann with lying to the FBI . Prosecutors say Mr. Sussmann lied to the FBI in 2016 about acting on behalf of the Clinton campaign when he handed over now-debunked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia ’ s Alfa Bank . Mr. Sussmann billed the Clinton campaign for the September 2016 meeting with the FBI , according to court documents . Both sides plan to call a handful of FBI agents and introduce notes and other internal bureau documents . The evidence threatens to put the FBI on trial , at least in the court of public opinion . “ At its heart , this is a simple case : Did Sussmann lie to the general counsel of the FBI ? Anything beyond that and the FBI ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake , ” said Tom Fitton , president of Judicial Watch , a conservative government watchdog group . So far , at least 10 FBI officials are expected to take the stand in the case , evenly split between prosecution and defense witnesses . The number of FBI officials testifying in one case is unusual , said Lew Schiliro , who used to run the bureau ’ s New York office . “ An agent can be called as a defense witness , but it ’ s not a regular thing , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the agent is a prosecution witness. ” Prosecutors will also call two CIA officials who will testify that Mr. Sussmann pitched them similar allegations in early 2017 after Mr. Trump had taken office . The case has upended the traditional partisan narratives surrounding the FBI ’ s actions investigating Mr. Trump ’ s alleged ties to Russia . Mr. Durham , a holdover from Trump ’ s Attorney General William P. Barr , is portraying the FBI as innocent dupes , while defense attorneys representing a Clinton campaign official are arguing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Mr. Sussmann ’ s lie spurred the FBI to spend time and resources probing anti-Trump claims that proved to be unfounded . The FBI concluded the communications were simply marketing emails and , later , special counsel Robert Mueller also concluded there was no evidence to support the Alfa Bank claims . As they tell it , Mr. Sussmann met with the FBI to mislead them into investigating Mr. Trump . That enabled the Clinton campaign to peddle Alfa-Bank stories to the media ahead of a presidential election with a hook that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ The strategy was to create news stories … . to get the government to investigate … and get to the press to report the government was investigating , ” prosecutor Andrew DeFilippis said in court this week . That has put the defense in the awkward position of arguing the FBI was fully aware of Mr. Sussmann ’ s ties to the Clinton campaign but plowed ahead without giving his allegations extra scrutiny . Defense attorneys say they have more than 300 emails and a note from a March 2017 Justice Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sussmann ’ s Democratic ties . At best , the defense counsel paints the FBI as incurious , willing to move on the anti-Trump allegations without vetting them first . Micheal Bosworth , a Sussmann defense attorney , wondered aloud in court last month why the FBI didn ’ t ask more questions of his client . He said the investigators had opportunities to ask about Mr. Sussmann ’ s ties to the Clinton campaign and the data he handed over to the FBI . “ Our position is there was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that required him to answer , ‘ Here ’ s my relationship with the Clinton campaign , ’ nor has the special counsel identified any free-standing obligation to disclose any relationship with the Clinton campaign , ” Mr. Bosworth said . When prosecutors later accused Mr. Sussmann of concealing concerns about the internet traffic tying Mr. Trump to Alfa Bank , Mr. Bosworth again asked why the FBI didn ’ t probe deeper . He noted officials weren ’ t interested to know where the data came from . “ A simple question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ‘ Who are the cyber experts ? ’ ” Mr. Bosworth said . Mr. Fitton said the case presents a conundrum for the FBI because to defend itself it would have to argue that “ individuals running the FBI didn ’ t know what was up and what was down. ” The purported evidence Mr. Sussmann presented of covert communication between Mr. Trumo and Alfa Bank was investigated by the FBI , which concluded the claims were meritless . Investigators said the internet traffic between the bank and the Trump Organization was merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found no evidence to support Mr. Sussmann ’ s allegations , telling Congress it simply wasn ’ t true . The trial , which is expected to last two weeks , is the first for Mr. Durham and his three-year probe . Mr. Trump and conservatives have cheered Mr. Durham ’ s work , which has racked up three indictments and one guilty plea . Former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith pleaded guilty in 2020 to altering an email used to apply for surveillance warrants for Trump campaign adviser Carter Page . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Durham . Igor Dancehnko , a key source for British ex-spy Christopher Steele ’ s anti-Trump dossier , is also facing charges arising from Mr. Durham ’ s investigation . He is accused of lying to the FBI about how and where he got information for the dossier , a collection of unverified and salacious claims tying Mr. Trump to Russia . Some conservatives , including Mr. Fitton , have criticized Mr. Durham for slow-walking the probe and wasting a lot of time pursuing weak cases . They gripe that three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one minor guilty plea resulting in probation . “ Based on Durham ’ s filings , the Clinton campaign was clearly involved in a criminal conspiracy to target Trump , but rather than going after the big dogs , Durham is trying to walk around it , ” Mr. Fitton said .

""""""" Republicans will have a narrow majority in the House next year . It ’ s going to be Hunter Biden time all the time in Congress in 2023 ! Let ’ s explain—and explore . Who ? One of the parties in this story is Hunter Biden , Joe Biden ’ s son . The others are the Republican chairs-to-be of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees . Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan , pictured above , chairs Judiciary . Kentucky Rep. James Comer chairs Oversight . What ( and when ) ? The Republican duo said at a press conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subpoenas , dispatch investigators , and hold hearings regarding the younger Biden ’ s business dealings just as soon as their party is back in power in the House . Why ? This is the big question . As Insider recently wrote , it would not be quite fair to say that Republican claims about Hunter Biden ’ s alleged malfeasance constitute a full-fledged conspiracy theory . During his father ’ s vice presidency , Hunter was , in real life , paid and granted equity by Chinese and Ukrainian entities with business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. government . His professional career , more broadly , has long consisted of brokering , lobbying , and consulting jobs for which his familial connections to powerful individuals have been a chief qualification . Moreover , there have been reports that Hunter Biden is already being investigated by the Department of Justice for having made false statements on tax returns and an application to purchase a gun . His behavior—and the question of whether he ’ s gotten away with anything illegal because his father was a senator/the vice president/the president—is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional standards . But Jordan and other Republicans are not obsessed with Hunter Biden because they believe humbly in the ideals of ethical government . Instead , they are taking cues from Donald Trump , who for several years has fixated on a number of fantastical and never-proven accusations that Hunter and Joe Biden are engaged in Deep State corruption together . This idea was originally spawned in the far-right media—Google “ Biden crime family , ” or , actually , don ’ t . The most consequential of these conspiracy-adjacent allegations is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire a high-level prosecutor because the prosecutor was investigating a company that Hunter Biden worked with . This claim appears to have things backwards—every non–right-wing account of events suggests that the firing of the prosecutor made Hunter Biden ’ s company more likely to face official scrutiny—but Trump ’ s obsession with it eventually led to his ( first ) impeachment . Thus , some might suggest that using House resources to investigate Hunter Biden would be a strategic mistake . Trump ’ s repeated public references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rundown of half-explained outbursts by the man during his first debate with the elder Biden ) were largely ignored by non-Republican voters in 2020 . And his elevation of candidates who share his beliefs about the “ stolen ” 2020 election are believed to be a main reason for the disappointing GOP performance in the midterms . Newly elected Republican New York Rep. George Santos was likely expressing a belief shared by other incoming members when he posited judiciously on Fox News last week that the party may not want to U-turn its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump Conspiracy Radiation Zone . However , newly elected New York Rep. George Santos isn ’ t in charge of the Republican Party . Looney-tunes enthusiasts like Jim Jordan are in charge of the Republican Party ! This week ’ s top Capitol Hill story , actually , is that some Trump supporters in the House—led by Florida Rep. and frequent Fox News guest Matt Gaetz—are claiming they won ’ t vote for current minority leader Kevin McCarthy to become speaker because he ’ s not MAGA enough , despite his full post-Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hand some of the most powerful jobs in government over to , for example , Jim Jordan . Whether or not the push to depose McCarthy goes anywhere , it shows how strongly many right-wingers still believe that their party ’ s national brand should be “ self-inflicted online brain damage. ” So continues the hammering of Hunter Biden–related stories by Fox News stars like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity , although part of that is also likely due to nonpartisan interest in Hunter ’ s romantic pursuits and history of drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable news here , still . So—where hence ? Probably to a series of hearings about Hunter Biden featuring unreliable witnesses , wild speculation , and complicated conspiracy-guy flowcharts like this one : This Republican impulse is almost rational . Trump and his party won the political upset of a lifetime in 2016 after a campaign in which they brought up Hillary Clinton ’ s alleged responsibility in the deaths of State Department employees in Benghazi , Libya—and her use of a private email server for state business—on a daily basis . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that election recedes into history , it becomes more and more apparent that Trump and the right don ’ t have a singular power to “ Benghazi ” someone into unpopularity . Clinton was a candidate with a uniquely long history in public life . Voters had 25 years to form negative opinions about her before she ran against Trump . Part of the problem was that she was a liberal woman , a type of human that pays what you might describe as a “ lady premium ” in American public approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet realized how fully Trump would try to take advantage of its sense of obligation to cover ( and thus amplify ) any allegation made by a major-party candidate , no matter how specious . But ! Part of it , too , was that Clinton did violate transparency rules by using a private email account at the State Department , was one of the founders of a nonprofit ( the Clinton Foundation ) that had been accused of sleazy favor-trading , did attempt to keep the transcripts of speeches she ’ d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did operate within an insular tribal network of loyalists that treated the press and public with hostility . She had , additionally , earned her presidential nomination in a heated primary campaign in which she ( and her many allies in the Democratic Party ) successfully put down a blunt-talking insurgent . If ever there was a time to run a campaign around the idea that the Democratic candidate was a slippery insider who was up to no good , it was that year , and perhaps only that year . Birtherism didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity , and an impeachment process that began with far-right theories about Vince Foster and so forth actually made Bill Clinton more popular than he ’ d been previously . Hillary Clinton was the exception that proves the rule—and the rule is that swing voters don ’ t read Infowars . """"""",0

""""""" A recent report by the world ’ s largest LGBTQ media advocacy organization found Illinois ranked third on a list of states with the highest number of drag events that were targeted and threatened in 2022 . The report released by GLAAD in late November offered a “ comprehensive count and analysis of increased threats , protests and violent action against drag events nationwide. ” The organization found 141 anti-LGBTQ incidents targeting drag events specifically , eight of which were in Illinois . GLAAD found news reports in 47 states around the U.S. excluding South Dakota , Rhode Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D.C . The states with the highest number of targeted drag events at the time the report was released Nov. 22 were Texas and North Carolina , both with 10 , followed by Illinois with eight , Tennessee and California , both with six , and Georgia with five , according to the report . The majority took place during Pride Month in June and in the fall , with incidents and rhetoric surrounding them becoming increasingly violent as the year went on , according to the report . Waylon Werner-Bassen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a performer and is co-producer of the Chicago chapter of children ’ s literacy nonprofit Drag Story Hour , said he believes much of the pushback is rooted in a lack of understanding and people unable to separate gender and sexuality . In Illinois , drag events advertised for families , such as story times , have been especially targeted by protesters . “ People don ’ t understand that all it is ( is ) reading of books and trying to create empathy in these kids , but also showing them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they ’ re actually then getting diverse books to read , ” Werner-Bassen said . “ I think sometimes , the unknown scares people , but once they learn we ’ re more than a stereotype , we get a lot of support. ” The nonprofit has faced issues in several states where there is a chapter , he said . Before coming to the Chicago area , he was the founder of the chapter in Nebraska , where he said “ specific statements ” were made about trying to target every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story Hour chapter . While several reports happened in smaller cities and towns in the southern and midwestern parts of the U.S. , many also took place in areas with large LGBTQ populations and within LGBTQ-inclusive communities , according to the GLAAD report . TJ Billard is an assistant professor at Northwestern University ’ s school of communication and executive director of the Center for Applied Transgender Studies , a Chicago-based independent nonprofit research organization . Billard , who uses the pronouns they/them , said a possible explanation why Illinois ranks so high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LGBTQ people in the area . “ This is a place where LGBTQ people live to be safe , but that ’ s also been where they can be found and attacked , ” they said . “ I think that ’ s part of what ’ s going on . On the other hand , I think a lot of it has to do with the degree of polarization between urban and rural communities . Illinois is a blue state by population numbers , but not by geography distribution . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including drag artists , in this state , and then we also look at the urban-rural divide , we end up with this clash. ” In late July , UpRising Bakery and Cafe in suburban Lake in the Hills was vandalized ahead of its highly anticipated drag show set to take place later that same day . The “ Starry Night Brunch Drag ” at the bakery was sold out and advertised as a family-friendly evening filled with food and entertainment . In September , the Downers Grove Public Library canceled a drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after receiving a threatening letter that included a bullet and the words “ more to come. ” Library staff also got a number of aggressive emails and threats from residents after the event , a bingo night for young adults featuring drag queen Aurora Divine , was announced . Lincoln Park Zoo had come under scrutiny for planning a drag story time as part of its Fall Fest programming in early October , according to its social media posts , while drag events as part of Plainfield ’ s first Pride Fest were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the GLAAD report , many of the drag events that were threatened with protests or violence were first targeted by right-leaning groups , media outlets and social media accounts . A number of the incidents in Illinois have , in part , been sparked by social media campaigns from Awake Illinois , a group rooted in the suburbs that formed through the anti-mask , anti-vaccine fervor amid the COVID-19 pandemic and has since been criticized for inflammatory anti-LGBTQ rhetoric . These entities tended to misrepresent drag events and spin them as “ harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Threats and protests would soon follow . Werner-Bassen said he believes groups like Awake Illinois are born from larger organizations at the national and international level that are trying to push an anti-drag and anti-LGBTQ agenda , with groups like Drag Story Hour being targeted . He said while some level of opposition happens with all their events , it ’ s more common in events taking place in the suburbs as opposed to the city . Another trend , he said , is seeing more drag events targeted when the topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platforms with some exchange of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric that then “ trickles down and encourages ” smaller local groups . “ Overall , we have felt very safe and our community , especially in the greater Chicagoland , has made us feel very welcomed and we usually have great turnouts with really supportive families , ” Werner-Bassen said . “ So it is surprising that we ’ re such a diverse area and we ’ re high on the list , but I also think it ’ s because usually the loudest people making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t even from our community. ” A reason he believes why Illinois ranks so high on the list could be the “ sheer amount of events ” in Illinois , which naturally means more opportunities for conflict . Another explanation could be the fact these types of incidents do get a lot of publicity in Illinois and don ’ t go unreported . “ In the Chicago area and Illinois being a blue state , you ’ ve got all types of ideologies being tackled everywhere , ” he said . “ There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I think in places like Illinois , it doesn ’ t get shoved under the rug as much because there are so many people that are supportive of these communities , so they want to talk about it and address it. ” While Billard said the LGBTQ community has come a long way in terms of gaining outward tolerance , acceptance and support , progress is inevitably a “ double-edged sword. ” “ We ’ re seeing improvements in life quality and political and social and economic parity , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fearful of the progress that has been made and try to stop that , ” they said . “ It can be confusing when it feels like things are getting worse only because they got better . We are at a crucial point in culture and society where either backlash to LGBTQ+ equality will overtake us or we will overcome the wave with continued support and be on our way to a more lasting and stable and equitable future . ” """"""",0

When the southern rebels ’ Ethiopian benefactor , President Mengistu Haile Mariam , was overthrown by a coalition of rebel groups in 1991 , the SPLA abandoned thousands of the recruits who made their way on foot to the border with Kenya . The book also offers reason to question the prospect , shared by many American observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead South Sudan through its first years of independence , he might have succeeded in averting its civil war . Despite Garang ’ s advocacy of a unified Sudanese state , ethnic divisions were already becoming institutionalized within the SPLA command .

Over time , those divisions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifts came to a head in 1991 , when Riek Machar , an ethnic Nuer , led a mutiny against Garang , a Dinka , and began advocating for an independent South Sudan . Those splits would persist after independence , when South Sudan ’ s first president , Salva Kiir , went to war in 2013 with Machar , who became Juba ’ s first vice president . Berger traces the origins of the child army back as far as the early 1980s , following a military mutiny by Garang and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jonglei state , that started Sudan on the course of Africa ’ s longest-running conflict , one that resulted in the deaths of some 2 million people from hunger , illness , and conflict and drove millions more from their homes .

With the help of the Ethiopian security forces , the SPLA established the Bonga Revolutionary War Institute , also known as the Bonga Military College , to train the children for warfare . “ Thousands of children and youth had made their way across the border in search of safety … but the majority , particularly after 1987 , were part of the organised movement of children by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPLA cast a broad net , sweeping up boys in the Ethiopian refugee camps and launching its first of three waves of forced recruitment in southern Sudanese villages . “ Some would have lost parents in the war but the reason for their presence in the camp was not their lack of a parent but their recruitment by the SPLA , often in violent sweeps through small villages and rural countryside , ” Berger writes , referring to press reports of tens of thousands of orphans at Panyidut . The boys , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fleeing civil war and respite from famine but because they were “ put into training in support of the rebel army. ” Successive recruitment waves were launched after the 2005 peace agreement ending the civil war and in the years leading up to the civil war pitting Kiir against Machar .

In one particularly tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the lower deck of a barge overloaded with fuel and cattle at the port of Adok in Unity state .

Punishment included savage beatings and the withholding of food for up to 45 days .

But Berger dismantles that narrative , citing former child soldiers who claimed kids were sent to the front lines , sometimes with only enough training to pull a rifle trigger . Among the tasks largely assigned to youth were the laying of land mines and the detonation of explosives .

Garang envisioned a united , socialist Sudan in which religious and ethnic differences were managed by a single national identity . An early manifesto published in 1983 by the SPLA proclaimed the urgent need to “ transform the Southern Movement from a reactionary movement led by reactionaries and concerned only with the South , jobs and self interest [ sic ] to a progressive movement led by revolutionaries and dedicated to the socialist transformation of the whole country. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charismatic figure who was educated in the United States , developed close ties to American evangelicals and liberal political advocates . You ’ d be hard-pressed to find another African movement that enjoyed the same level of bipartisan support . Conservative political leaders , including Bush , and American progressives like Susan Rice placed their bets on Garang ’ s ability to transform Sudan into a pro-American force . In doing so , Washington has tread gingerly over the forced recruitment campaign . In 2008 , the United States passed the Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of child soldiers and prohibited the provision of military assistance to countries that employ child soldiers . South Sudan has appeared each year on the list of countries—which includes Myanmar , Iraq , Nigeria , and other countries—targeted by the law . But both Democratic and Republican administrations have given the South a pass . In 2012 , the Obama administration issued the first presidential waiver to South Sudan , which allows the United States to fund U.N. peacekeeping operations in Sudan and South Sudan , Berger writes . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s research began with a fascinating , but ultimately heartbreaking , side story in the Sudanese saga . Between 1985 and 1986 , the SPLA and its political wing , the Sudan People ’ s Liberation Movement , sent a group of 619 Red Army children and teenagers to Cuba , where they received political , medical , ideological , and military training . These kids—many of them children of senior SPLA officers—were to form the vanguard of a new socialist Sudan . The “ cadres , ” she writes , “ were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ rather than ‘ South Sudanese ’ and to envisage the taking up of arms as a means to unite rather than divide the country. ” But the movement they served had already begun shifting in a new direction . Back home , the Sudanese government declared its jihad against the SPLA , and the southern Sudanese began to increasingly identify with their ethnic and religious groups . The notion of a unified , socialist state was slipping away . And after more than a decade in Cuba , the youngsters found themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Rip Van Winkle existence , ” Berger writes . “ They knew next to nothing of the changes back in their home country. ” Some 200 immigrated to Canada , where they found work at Lakeside Packers , then the largest cattle slaughterhouse in Canada , just outside the small town of Brooks , a two hours ’ drive east of Calgary . Those who did return to Sudan either found that their families—some of whom led the rebellion against Garang—had fallen out of favor or encountered hostility and suspicion among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the war and feared their Cuban-trained cadres would supplant them . The officers often sent them to the front lines , where most were killed . “ The result was that highly specialised , Cuban-trained soldiers were sent into frontline situations as virtual fodder , ” Berger writes .

""""""" One year after a tornado tore a three block-wide strip of devastation through Chicago ’ s western suburbs , a hard-hit neighborhood in Woodridge remains a work in progress . The trees that smashed through roofs and littered the streets are long gone , replaced by saplings swaddled in green irrigation bags . Plenty of sawed-off trunks remain , though , bearing witness to what happened in a few violent moments the night of June 20 , 2021 . Likewise , while many houses are adorned with gleaming new siding and freshly shingled roofs , a few are still boarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving nothing behind but a foundation , a security fence and a construction company ’ s advertising sign . In short , the recovery appears to be following the same hit-or-miss pattern as the tornado itself , with some homeowners bouncing back and others still waiting to be made whole , bedeviled by insurance hassles , supply chain problems or contractor availability . “ The stress over the year has been unbelievable , ” said Richard Remson , whose heavily damaged house has been rebuilt except for his elevated deck . “ You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company and you have to give it to a contractor you know nothing about . How would you feel about that ? ” The National Weather Service concluded the tornado touched down in Naperville about 11:10 p.m. before carving a 16-mile path through Woodridge , Darien and unincorporated DuPage County , damaging hundreds of houses and destroying an untold number of trees . Classified at its peak as an EF-3 , its sustained wind speed reached as high as 140 mph . Eight people were hospitalized with storm-related injuries . One Woodridge resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child when she was struck by a tree that crashed through the roof of her in-laws ’ house . It was one of the most powerful storms to hit the Chicago area in years ― much more damaging than last Monday ’ s extreme weather , whose 80 mph winds still toppled plenty of big trees and knocked out power to thousands of residents . An extensive cleanup began almost immediately after last year ’ s tornado , with chain saw-wielding homeowners , neighbors and work crews slicing through thick tree branches that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morgan Arcisz lost two mature trees , a pine and a pear , but luckily they didn ’ t damage her Woodridge house . She recalled a terrifying few minutes when an emergency text message prompted her to round up her mother , her cats and a bird cage and dart downstairs just before the tornado arrived . “ All you heard was a big boom , and that ’ s probably when it was right here because it made a straight shot ( down the street ) , ” she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience to go though. ” She received two replacement trees , an Ohio buckeye and a common hackberry , from the Morton Arboretum , which delivered more than 300 to affected areas . “ The trees were chosen by location so they ’ d be varieties that would be appropriate for each community and would provide some diversity , ” arboretum spokeswoman Tari Marshall said . Evergreen Lane in Woodridge was stripped of nearly all its trees , and many of its houses took significant damage . Lorelei Johansen , who hunkered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said she needed new siding and a new roof in the aftermath . “ Pretty much everybody on this block had some hole ( punched into their house ) , ” she said . “ I had a hole in my garage . They had a hole in their kitchen . She had a hole in her bathroom . Every house had something. ” She was able to stay in her house while it was rebuilt , though conflicts with her insurance company dragged out the process . Others were not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors are still fighting with their insurers or even trying to sell their houses as-is . Not far away , Chuck Hinrichs had a pile of lumber in his driveway awaiting the contractor who would turn it into a garage . He had no problems with his insurer , but said the settlement he received has already been outstripped by inflation . “ It ’ s going to be a pretty good amount of money ( out of pocket ) , but we ’ re making improvements , also , ” he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 231 structures were damaged by the tornado and 22 houses remain in disrepair . One belongs to Marc and Marie Whirledge , a two-story skeleton of studs and flooring protected from the weather by a new roof and a thin layer of home wrap . Marie Whirledge said she visits daily to check on the progress , or lack thereof , because she and her husband are living with her parents five minutes away . She has watched with mixed feelings as neighbors , whose houses once were tagged as uninhabitable , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . “ I ’ m really happy for them . I just wish it was time for us to move in , ” she said . As in Woodridge , some Naperville homeowners have been stymied by insurance and supply chain issues , along with contractor availability . “ We ’ ve seen various stages of reconstruction happening , and sometimes things were happening and then they would come to a stop because they were waiting for windows , ” city spokeswoman Linda LaCloche said . A few months after the tornado hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the city to establish a long-term recovery group with local nonprofits to deal with the lasting effects of the tornado . “ There ’ s obviously always logistics to be worked out , ” she said . “ We think we can work through the network of nonprofits that are already established to create something like that for the future. ” More assistance came from the office of the Lisle Township assessor , which provided property tax relief to residents whose houses were uninhabitable . Deputy Assessor Steve Arling said 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 in Woodridge and 56 condominium units in unincorporated Woodridge . Darien Mayor Joe Marchese said his town , which lay toward the end of the storm ’ s rampage , suffered damage in two subdivisions , though the toll wasn ’ t as severe as in neighboring Woodridge . While Darien made it through the tornado without a great deal of destruction or any significant injuries , Marchese said the episode still produced lasting changes . “ When people hear the tornado warning , they used to just watch ( to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . “ Now they go down to their basements right away . It raised the alertness level of a lot of people. ” Houses were not the only structures battered by the storm . Woodridge ’ s Skeleton Key Brewery , which had only recently expanded , lost a chunk of its roof in the tornado , then saw the interior ruined by days of rain . Co-owner Emily Slayton and her partners had their own headaches and delays — “ We weren ’ t able to do the internal build-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were aided by an online fundraising effort that netted $ 135,000 . Skeleton Key finally reopened last month , and Slayton said business has been good . To honor those who helped revive the brewery , she had an inspirational print made from a favorite book , “ The Boy , the Mole , the Fox and the Horse , ” and decorated it with the handwritten names of all 2,000 fundraiser contributors . “ We ’ re grateful to remain in Woodridge , ” Slayton said . “ It ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the support . ” """"""",0

"Photo by Jim Hubbard/Bettmann Archive/Getty Images The future of conservatism looks uncannily like a return to its recent past. On both sides of the Atlantic the right is doubling down on libertarian economics and culture wars – a curious blend of Truss and Trump. But this is driven by panic and the failure to learn from errors in office, and it is self-defeating: the chaos unleashed by reviving libertarian economic policies will strengthen the case for technocratic solutions. Right-wing populism endorses the same broken market model that leaves millions of people disillusioned and alienated from politics. Mixing economic liberalism with social illiberalism intensifies what I have previously described as our anti-political age. This right-wing revolution is not wholly new. Its origins can be found in the converging conservatism of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, who in the 1980s extolled the virtues of the free market while insisting on traditional morality – faith, family and the flag, in the face of secular communism. Yet now, as then, the right fails to grasp that free-market economics undermines social customs and traditions.",0

"By Tom Raines Following elections in July, the leading political parties of Spain have struggled to broker a coalition government. Neither of the traditional parties – the left-wing Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) or the conservative People’s Party (PP) – won a sufficient number of seats to make an outright majority or even a minority government plausible. Consequently, both are vying to form a government with the help of smaller parties. This comes with its own difficulties. In particular, the decisive role of Catalan separatists in forming a new government is likely to redefine the legal status of Catalonia in Spain. Despite leading the PP to winning a plurality of seats, the party leader Alberto Feijóo has struggled to form a coalition. Winning approximately 39% of seats, it might have been assumed that Mr. Feijóo would become the new Prime Minister. However, the complicated relationship between the PP and parties on the right have marred his opportunities of doing so.",0

"The Ohio advocates knew from focus-group testing that they would have to address the misgivings that many voters have about “abortion on demand,” as groups that oppose abortion put it. “There are some concerns even among pro-choice voters about abortion being used as birth control,” says Angela Kuefler, a partner at Global Strategy Group, which has run message testing for campaigns in several states. “That’s the nuance a lot of people bring to this issue, and you have to acknowledge that it’s OK to have mixed feelings.” Abortion-access advocates have sometimes highlighted an unapologetic and feminist argument — “Bans off our bodies” or the classic “My body, my choice.” But these slogans don’t necessarily preach beyond the choir. “I am not looking for a messenger that resonates with me,” says Ashley All, who helped run the campaign that defeated the measure in Kansas and advises others, including in Ohio, for the national group Families United for Freedom. “I’m looking for messengers that resonate with the people I’m trying to persuade.” In Ohio, people in focus groups felt strongly about being able to take care of their families without judgment or interference. “One exercise we do is to walk people through a situation in which a friend or family member comes to you and says, ‘I’m going to have an abortion,’” Kuefler says. “At the end of the day, some people who are pro-life will say, ‘I’ll drive you to the clinic.’ But you have to give them a path to get there.” She mentioned ads like one in Kansas featuring a Catholic grandmother saying, “If it were my granddaughter, I wouldn’t want the government making that decision for her.” In Michigan, a father in a gray hoodie said to the camera with indignation, “No politician tells my daughter what to do when medical emergencies come up.”",0
"“We hereby declare the establishment of a Jewish state.” Most readers have likely never heard of either Rabbi Yehoshua Shapira or the Ramat Gan Yeshiva, which he heads.

At the conclusion of Independence Day this year, in one of the largest demonstrations seen in Jerusalem for years, Rabbi Shapira had the honor of being the final speaker. As he strode to the podium, the audience welcomed him by singing “Add days to the days of the king!” (taken from the verse in Psalms 61) – the custom in Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) yeshivas, and lately also in their Hardali (nationalist Haredi) counterparts, when a great rabbi enters.",0

"This series of posts by Prof. Richard Re (Virginia) is based on his draft article, ""Does the Discourse on 303 Creative Portend a Standing Realignment,"" which is forthcoming in the Notre Dame Law Review Reflection. This final post tackles the biggest question raised by the discourse surrounding 303 Creative v. Elenis: Is there reason to suspect that a standing realignment might already be underway? Here's the key discussion from my paper: Begin with 303 Creative itself, which could easily be cited as evidence against the idea that legal culture is undergoing a standing realignment. Again, left-of-center jurists on both the court of appeals and the Supreme Court either supported standing or else left it unchallenged. Yet the discourse surrounding the case suggests that other trend-setters on the legal left are eager to push jurisdictional arguments in cases and contexts where liberal justices, so far, are not. Moreover, other cases evidence a standing realignment. In the student loan case, for instance, Justice Kagan's dissent for the three liberal justices (herself included) emphasized standing as well as the merits. The key question was whether a particular loan service entity created by a state should count as part of the state specifically for standing purposes. Ascertaining the exact boundaries of state governments is an infamously murky undertaking, sometimes yielding different answers under different doctrines. Yet Kagan's dissent hit hard on this issue. So perhaps the left-leaning justices are ready to cry foul whenever standing is a close or open question under existing case law, and many left commentators are now ready to do so even when it isn't. Other recent cases, too, have featured left justices enforcing standing restrictions, even when some conservative justices haven't. This pattern has become increasingly noticeable since Justice Kennedy retired in 2018, generating a clear conservative majority on the Court. Besides the student loan case, take United States v. Texas, which ruled for the Biden Administration on standing, yielding a solo dissent by Justice Alito. Or California v. Texas, where only Justices Alito and Gorsuch would have found standing. Related areas of justiciability are also at play. Take New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. City of New York, where six justices rejected a Second Amendment claim as moot, with Justices Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch dissenting. Additional examples of bipartisan standing denials include the failed efforts to challenge President Biden's victory in the 2020 election. These cases can be viewed as liberal wins, even without liberal rulings on the merits. All in all, standing (and some related doctrines) have emerged as a vital way for left justices to snatch victories from the jaws of a conservative Court….",0

""""""" On Wednesday , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released its first report on accidents involving vehicles operating with advanced driver assistance systems engaged , and Tesla earned the No . 1 spot on the list . The study looked at crash data over an 11-month period ending on May 15 . According to the report , out of 392 crashes , 273 — or 70 percent — occurred with Tesla vehicles . Before my inbox fills up with comments from angry Tesla fans , one of the major reasons , but not the only reason , why the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular vehicles in the ADAS category . ( I will address the other potential reason below . ) The Drive ’ s Rob Stumpf , an expert on automotive technology , pointed out that Tesla ’ s total number includes both vehicles equipped with standard Autopilot ( Level 2 ADAS ) and Full Self-Driving beta software ( Levels 3 to 5 ) . The NHTSA describes Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles as those that “ provide both speed and steering input when the driver assistance system is engaged but require the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving task at all times. ” FSD vehicles , which are still in the development stage , are not yet available to the general public . A separate NHTSA report explained that once the development stage has concluded , these cars “ will be capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task under defined operating conditions and will not require a human driver to monitor and supervise the automation system. ” At any rate , Honda finished in second place with 90 crashes ; Subaru had 10 ; Ford , five ; Toyota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GM , two ; and Volkswagen , Hyundai , Lucid and Porsche , one each . Before starting this study , the NHTSA issued an order requiring manufacturers to report all crashes involving vehicles operating with either an ADAS or an automated driving system “ active within 30 seconds prior to the crash , ” The Drive reported . Stumpf reported that the 30 second figure is significant because “ the NHTSA recently revealed that it had discovered at least 16 separate instances when Tesla ’ s Autopilot system ‘ aborted vehicle control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first impact . ' ” Returning to the high number of Tesla crashes compared to the other car manufacturers : As mentioned earlier , there are far more Teslas on the road than any other ADAS maker . That said , potential flaws in Tesla ’ s software could be contributing to the disproportionate number of Tesla crashes . In 2021 , the NHTSA initiated a probe in its Office of Defects Investigation into Teslas striking parked vehicles at first responder scenes . According to the report , “ most incidents took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included scene control measures such as first responder vehicle lights , flares , an illuminated arrow board , and road cones . The involved subject vehicles were all confirmed to have been engaged in either Autopilot or Traffic Aware Cruise Control during the approach to the crashes. ” Stumpf noted the NHTSA ’ s probe was recently “ upgraded to an Engineering Analysis , which is the final phase before a possible recall. ” Safety statistics for “ self-driving ” cars is conflicting , at best . Because it ’ s so new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data available from which to draw any real conclusions . This week ’ s report was the NHTSA ’ s first ever on crashes involving vehicles equipped with automated driving systems . Another reason for the inconsistencies between studies is the six “ levels ” of automated vehicles . The Society of Automotive Engineers provides a graphic on its website that highlights the features of each level . Vehicles that require no input from the driver ( Level 5 automation ) are not yet available to consumers . We have to remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising , is still in its infancy . """"""",0
""""""" Michele Swinick worked as an election judge in Maricopa County on Election Day earlier this week . Swinick has come forward with information regarding her experience in Maricopa County on Election Day . She worked Election Day as a judge at the Islamic Voting Center in Scottsdale , AZ . Swinick reported that the center is heavily Republican , with “ no party ” designated voters as the second most populous demographic . The district reportedly contained very few Democrats , since Swinick checked in very few of them on Election Day . “ Swinick says that the tabulators all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before the election , ” Uncover DC reports . “ The problem with scanning began immediately with the first ballots. ” “ Poll workers estimated about 1 in 10 ballots were being read for the first three hours of voting , ” Uncover DC added . “ Voters were given options to either spoil their ballots and try again or drop them into a different section called ‘ Door 3 . ' ” As per Swinick , their inspector had to empty the ballots from “ Door 3 ” three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of ballots . Typically , ballots aren ’ t supposed to be removed from that box until polls close , but they made an exception because the box was jamming and became too full . Swinick reports that the technician came to the center between 3:30 pm and 4:00 pm MT and rebooted the machines . After this , there were no further issues with ballots being run through tabulators . She reported that one of the poll workers told her , “ Everything is now going smoothly with the tabulators. ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offsite supervisor had advised “ Because of the situation ” to put all “ door 3 ” ballots that had not been scanned through a tabulator into a separate black bag and to label them “ misreads. ” As a judge , Michele told UncoverDC that she personally signed the sticker placed over the bag ’ s zipper , and then these bags were sent to the tabulation center to be counted . Michele informed us that the normal process for a ballot that is “ unread ” is for poll workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time before sending them to the center . As per Swinick , this was not done . The County had set up a website to give voters the ability to check that their vote was counted . The problem is Michele has proven that the website isn ’ t correct and seems to be using a voter ’ s “ check in ” as evidence their vote was tabulated rather than the actual tabulation of the vote . Michele offered her first-hand proof of this . “ My roommate ran his ballot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1st voters at the Islamic Center . It did not read the ballot . He was forced to drop it in door # 3 . About an hour after I arrived home at 9 pm MT , my roommate checked the website to see if his vote had been counted . The website reported it was . It is mathematically impossible for his vote to have been counted by then since only an hour before , I left the center , and the ballots had not been taken from the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hand exchanged to another transport team , which takes them to the tabulation center . For his ballot to have been counted , it would have also needed to be sorted and hand-counted by a team at that center and reported into the website —all within that hour . In the case of In Person/Day of Voting , this proves the reporting of his ballot being received & counted is actually based on his being checked into the Voting Center and him receiving a ballot to be cast—NOT his ballot being scanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted at the tabulation center. ” According to the report , Swinick has been threatened by her supervisor for speaking out about what she witnessed .

"What does a fair distribution of economic resources look like? It is a question that will dog the Conservative Party Conference this week as questions over inheritance tax, VAT on school fees and the triple-lock on state pensions return to British politics, bringing with them the attendant economic resentments of class and age. Yet such debates are inevitable: the British economy is not growing like it used to and the grim spectre of an ageing society looms on the horizon. It is a marked difference to the optimism of classical economics. Most of us are used to living in a society with a strong belief in material progress, with a sense that we can collectively advance as a society. This belief allowed us to assume that the shared pie that is the national economy is always growing and so, if we work together to grow it ever larger, our slice will grow with it. Not all societies are like this, however. Most throughout human history, especially peasant or tribal societies, have no illusions of material progress and so tend to be structured around zero-sum thinking. Like what you’re reading?

""""""" “ I think it ’ s funny that the world fell in love with me because of crying and a tear , ” Sinéad O ’ Connor says in a voiceover for the new documentary Nothing Compares . “ I went and did a lot of crying and everyone was like , ‘ Oh , you crazy bitch. ’ But actually wait . Hold on . You fell in love with that tear. ” She takes a pause before finishing the thought : “ That was a mirror. ” Nothing Compares , which premiered ( virtually ) Friday night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the career , the controversy , the legacy , the misconception , and , one could argue , the redemption and vindication of Sinéad O ’ Connor . That crying and that tear refers to the stunning music video for her chart-topping 1990 cover of Prince ’ s “ Nothing Compares 2 U , ” one of two pillars of her pop culture iconography . The other is… decidedly more controversial , and arguably destroyed her career . Directed by filmmaker Kathryn Ferguson , the documentary contextualizes the abuse the Irish singer suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as she pursued art and music , and the way that pain was unleashed on the public stage as she dressed her pop stardom up with provocative activism . It ’ s largely centered on the years between 1987 and 1993 , when the nonconformist artist dazzled a changing industry with her vocals–capable of a lullaby lilt and banshee wail with equal prowess–and her defiant image as a young girl from Dublin with a shaved head and rebellious confidence . That confidence carried over to her messaging , a relentless adherence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements and attention-grabbing stunts . The most infamous of these , tearing up a photo of the Pope in protest of the Catholic Church ’ s silencing of abuse victims during a 1992 Saturday Night Live performance , is the climax of the documentary—and , here , it ’ s being revisited through modern eyes . At the height of O ’ Connor ’ s popularity , few other artists managed to capture as much attention for their music— “ Nothing Compares 2 U ” vaulted her to international-sensation status—or their unflinching politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public eye , her brazenness was at the thrilling nexus point of polarization , with the controversy celebrated and criticized in equal measure , until , well , that equilibrium shifted . Drastically . Nothing Compares is bookended by O ’ Connor ’ s appearance at Madison Square Garden two weeks after the SNL firestorm , during which her entrance onstage was met by a deafening , uncomfortable cacophony of supportive applause and infuriated booing . ( “ The weirdest noise I ’ ve heard in my fucking life , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Centered on that period of her career , the film is a portrait of a female artist who spoke her truth , no matter the reaction or consequence . It ’ s also an indictment of what happened to someone at that time , a woman especially , when they spoke against the status quo and used their voice to disrupt systems—or , frankly , use their voice at all . “ I was always being ‘ crazied ’ by the media , made out to be crazy , ” O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t blame anybody for thinking I was crazy or for hating me for it or whatever , because they didn ’ t know . It was a crazy idea . This bitch is saying priests are raping children ? Jesus Christ . Of course it seemed crazy to them. ” The film is told using archival footage and B-roll to establish a sense of time and place throughout the decades of O ’ Connor ’ s life . It also sparingly includes voiceover from people close to her : the music teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school that otherwise traumatized her , her ex-husband with whom she had her first child , friends , managers , and the publicist who booked her for that fateful appearance on SNL . The key voice , of course , is O ’ Connor herself , in a new interview in which she reflects on the newsworthy events of her past , how she felt about them then , and how she feels about them now . It ’ s pivotal context that reframes pop culture controversy through humanity , showing us how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to affect her . Whenever there is a documentary made with the participation of the artist who is the subject , there ’ s the question of what might be the goal behind it . Is it to correct history ? To settle old scores ? To control the messaging and the discourse about them ? Is it to reconsider their legacy and have them seen in a new light ? Is it vanity ? Or is there something to say ? Nothing Compares reckons with the idea of whether O ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she used her platform as a soapbox were before her time . It also , however , suggests that , as a trailblazer who culture might have needed—even as it rejected her—she was right on time , acting in the way she should have at exactly the right moment . The film is not concerned , necessarily , with whether or not her actions were “ right , ” justified , or warranted , at least not as much as it is with what happened to her . It targets the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as crazy , and , by the same people who championed her when they agreed with her views , disregarded and blacklisted . What did that do to her ? More , how should that make us view her now ? Is Sinéad O ’ Connor a martyr ? “ I didn ’ t mean to be strong , ” she says . “ I wasn ’ t thinking to myself I must be strong . I didn ’ t know I was strong . I did suffer through a lot because everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shit out of me . I regret that I was so sad because of it . I regret that I spent so many years lonely and isolated really. ” Especially over the last few years , following documentaries about the likes of Britney Spears , Paris Hilton , and Janet Jackson , we ’ ve been reckoning with not just the media ’ s complicity in the misogyny , exploitation , and derision that played a part in ruining famous women ’ s personal lives and careers , but our own complicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing Compares gives crucial context to O ’ Connor ’ s painful adolescence and the reasons for her complicated relationship with the Catholic Church . She discusses how her original intention with her art was to use it as a form of therapy but also , in the grand tradition of her creative heroes , to agitate . It was never her goal , she says multiple times , to be a pop star , and she was never comfortable in that mold—nor ever fearful of it being taken away as retribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends time focusing on the reaction to her controversial actions , like when Frank Sinatra pledged to “ kick her ass ” after she refused to perform at a New Jersey venue if it played the national anthem before her set ( she was protesting the censorship of Black artists ) and especially after the SNL incident , when countless celebrities and pundits didn ’ t just belittle her and her mental health or destroy her records , but wished actual violence on her . “ Maybe if I was a man there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , ” she says about the national anthem scandal . “ It ’ s just not expected of women. ” The documentary underlines O ’ Connor ’ s impact on decades of female artists who have been celebrated for being vocal about their beliefs and politics , rather than criticized for it like she was . There are montages of abortion rights and pro-LGBTQ legislation being passed and of the Catholic Church acknowledging the sexual abuse of children—the very causes O ’ Connor protested—indicating a sort of vindication for her efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , it never lets the question dissipate : What was the cost ? It ’ s somewhat of a shame that the film doesn ’ t expand on the specific details of how those tumultuous years in her career have reverberated through her complicated , often troubled life in the decades since . She had been public over the years , in a manner that alarmed some , about her suicidal ideation . And it ’ s a particularly painful , yet perhaps necessary , time to be examining O ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just days ago , it was reported that O ’ Connor had been hospitalized one week after her 17-year-old son was found dead , following a series of tweets she had posted indicating that she might commit suicide in order to be with him . ( She has since apologized for those tweets . ) It all casts a haunting shadow on a project meant to honor the work O ’ Connor has done and the toll it might have taken . “ I regret that people treated me like shit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already that that really , really killed me and hurt me , ” she says in the film . “ They all thought I should be made a mockery of for throwing my career down the drain . I didn ’ t say I wanted to be a pop star . It didn ’ t suit me to be a pop star . So I didn ’ t throw away any fucking career that I wanted . It didn ’ t change my attitude . I wasn ’ t sorry . I didn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proudest thing I ’ ve ever done as an artist. ” “ They broke my heart and they killed me , but I didn ’ t die , ” she says . “ They tried to bury me .

"In October 2010, liberal comedians Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert gathered over two hundred thousand fans in Washington DC for their Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. Its premise was to restore “sanity” and respectful discourse to American politics to break through the noise of the extremes, especially in the face of the rising Tea Party. Though few expected a satirical rally hosted by two comedians to course-correct our country’s slide toward extremism, thirteen years later, it’s clear any such attempts were a failure. In 2016, Donald Trump beat all predictions to become president of the United States. He injected a new type of viciousness into American politics, expressing explicit xenophobia and a disregard for democratic norms, with a bombastic style that whipped up his base while provoking outrage on the part of the traditional political class and punditry. Many have since reiterated Stewart and Colbert’s 2010 plea for the country to return to normalcy and to repudiate Trump and his style of politics. Those pleas have largely landed on deaf ears. Over the past few years, Trump’s movement has successfully monopolized control of the Republican Party while taking an increasingly authoritarian bent. Earlier this month, a coalition of thirteen of the fourteen US presidential libraries and foundations published yet another Stewartian plea, titled “Strengthening Our Democracy.” The letter, first proposed by the George W. Bush Presidential Center, implores all Americans to “engage in civil dialogue; respect democratic institutions and rights; uphold safe, secure, and accessible elections; and contribute to local, state, or national improvement.” The foundations and libraries of every president since Herbert Hoover, except for the Eisenhower Foundation, signed onto the letter. It rebukes a long list of Trump’s obstructions of political norms (though without calling Trump out by name): inspiring and encouraging violence among supporters, serially violating the law, and challenging the 2024 election results, including with a failed coup attempt. But Trump’s criminal behavior and general disregard for democracy are not as much aberrations from the norm for US presidents as the establishment would like to believe. In fact, many of those same presidents whose centers and libraries are calling to “protect democracy” have engaged in their own share of attacks on civil liberties and majority rule. Democracy for Thee But Not for Me Though they lacked the militant and violent supporters that Trump boasts, past presidents also demonstrated frequent disregard for democracy, helping pave the way for Trumpian authoritarianism. That the Bush Foundation in particular came up with the idea for the letter is a juicy bit of Orwellian irony. Though he’s been increasingly rehabilitated in the public eye, with no small help from the Democratic Party, Bush’s eight years in the White House were a gross affront to democracy. Unlike Trump — who tried and failed to steal a presidential election — Bush actually succeeded. Despite Al Gore winning both the popular and, most likely, the Electoral College votes, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority voted to end the hotly contested Florida vote recount, delivering the presidency to Bush. That SCOTUS majority included two justices appointed by Bush’s father, and the effort to stop the recount included violent riots by right-wing operatives who physically assaulted those tasked with the recount. Bush’s 2004 reelection also remains suspect: the election introduced digital voting machines that exhibited extreme irregularities in the president’s favor. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the subsequent congressional anthrax scare, Bush took advantage of and stoked Americans’ collective fear to expand the powers of the presidency and violate constitutional rights. The Bush administration promptly passed the Patriot Act, closely based on a bill from the 1990s written by Joe Biden that had earlier been rejected by both parties for its illegal expansion of government surveillance. Muslim Americans were harassed by the police and federal government and illegally detained and questioned in black sites. Most notoriously, Bush launched two wars that, adding up direct and indirect casualties, killed millions; one of those wars, supported by leaders of both major parties, was based on explicit lies to the American people. In the course of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, the Bush administration illegally tortured prisoners of war and indefinitely detained suspected terrorists without due process. Barack Obama similarly built out illegal domestic and foreign surveillance efforts, including prosecuting and torturing whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning, Daniel Hale, and Edward Snowden. The Obama administration also expanded the unilateral executive use of drone warfare without congressional approval, which included claiming the authority to assassinate American citizens without a trial or due process. Like his predecessors, Obama carried out or supported disastrous regime change efforts, launching military intervention in Libya, intervening in Haiti’s elections, and legitimizing Honduras’s right-wing coup government. His administration also detained undocumented immigrants en masse — building and making use of the same facilities liberals correctly described as concentration camps during the Trump presidency. The presidents represented by the other signatories to the letter also serially violated civil liberties and attacked democratic norms. No one needs to be reminded that, in one of the great scandals of American presidential history, Richard Nixon spied on political opponents and attempted to cover it up. Internationally, Nixon engaged in illegal bombing campaigns of Cambodia, and his broader domestic program included going to war with Black Power organizers and infiltrating and destroying left-wing groups. Gerald Ford infamously pardoned Nixon, while under Lyndon B. Johnson’s watch, the FBI stalked and harassed civil rights movement activists, including urging Martin Luther King Jr to commit suicide; federal agencies were possibly even involved in his assassination. George H. W. Bush, as Nixon’s head of the CIA, covered up the car bombing of a former minister from Salvador Allende’s administration and his American secretary by the Augusto Pinochet government in the middle of Washington, DC. During his 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan secretly cut deals with the Iranian government to not let out American hostages so he could capitalize on the hostage crisis to defeat incumbent Jimmy Carter. As president, Reagan covertly and illegally sold weapons to the Iranian government to raise money to (again, also illegally) fund the right-wing Nicaraguan Contra death squads. The Reagan government similarly worked to cover up massacres in El Salvador by US-backed forces. A Constitution for the Rich and Powerful America’s antidemocratic history goes deeper than the crimes of individual politicians. Our political institutions themselves were designed to limit popular democracy, as argued for by the United States’ founders in the Federalist Papers. They feared letting the poor rule would lead to the expropriation of the rich. The Electoral College and US Senate and filibuster help enshrine minority rule, while a lifetime-appointed Supreme Court with the power of judicial review provides another elite check on democratic governance. And our system of first-past-the-post, single-member seats, along with restrictive ballot-access laws, has solidified a two-party system that comes close to letting the rich monopolize politics. Along with allowing the wealthy to spend near unlimited amounts of money to influence politics, many if not most public offices are effectively sold to the highest bidder. To the extent that Trump’s attacks on democracy differ from his predecessors’, it’s because of his disregard for the norms of decorum that put a veneer of civility on elite rule and his open embrace of political violence. Trump’s attacks on liberal democratic institutions are of course not an answer to our country’s democracy deficit. But neither is the shallow, hypocritical “defense” of American democracy presented by former presidents and their ultrarich allies, who are greatly invested in our existing institutions but who display little concern for real democracy — people having a meaningful say over their own lives.",0

The highest-risk areas span from Fort Myers to Tampa Bay , with water levels reaching as high as 10 feet .

Rising average temperatures are lifting sea levels and increasing the amount of rainfall from major storms , adding up to more devastating storm surges . The increasing devastation from extreme weather events , many worsened by climate change , is helping fuel a rise in disasters with damages exceeding $ 1 billion . But in Florida , as in much of the country , these costlier disasters also stem from the fact that more people are living and building in harm ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US population lives in a coastal county . Florida , however , has seen large increases in residents in these areas . From 2010 to 2020 , Miami gained more than 660,000 residents , while Tampa-St. Petersburg grew by more than 365,000 people , according to the Florida Department of Transportation . The Tampa Bay metro region is home to more than 3 million people , with homes , offices , and roadways built right up to the water ’ s edge in some areas , including regions vulnerable to inundation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worse the hurricane storm surge potential , ” Bob Weisberg , an oceanographer who studied flooding in Tampa Bay , told Vox ’ s Brian Resnick in 2019 . Florida ’ s sunny beaches are a powerful draw , but the state and local governments are also encouraging more people to move to the shores of the Sunshine State . “ You ’ ve got these coastal cities who are making a gamble by encouraging development even though it might not be environmentally sustainable or a good idea for people to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Meding , an associate professor who studies disasters and society at the Rinker School of Construction Management at the University of Florida . As more people move in , the homes , businesses , and infrastructure they need grow as well . So when a storm tears through a region , it leaves behind a much higher damage bill . However , von Meding added that his main concern isn ’ t that there are “ too many ” people in Florida , but rather where they choose to build and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , the dollar value of damages doesn ’ t always reflect who is most at risk and who suffers the most in the wake of a hurricane . Expensive , insured coastal vacation homes may register as higher losses than the sole residences of low-income families .

Hurricane modelers can now project the path of a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that decades ago was only possible 24 hours in advance , buying crucial time . But anticipating the intensity of a hurricane remains a challenge . Some studies have shown that more Atlantic hurricanes are undergoing rapid intensification , defined as a wind speed increase of 35 mph or more over 24 hours . As average temperatures rise , hurricanes are likely to spool up faster , making it harder for residents to evacuate in time . A storm doesn ’ t have to reach hurricane strength before it becomes dangerous , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Tides and severe rainfall on a regular basis , worsened by the fact that parts of the city are sinking . More than 10 inches of rain fell on Miami during a storm earlier this summer that flooded streets and caused a sewage plant to overflow .

A storm ’ s destruction doesn ’ t end after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequities can continue to propagate . People without insurance or the means to rebuild may have to permanently relocate or face lasting financial hardships . “ Recovery processes prefer people who already have resources , ” von Meding said . “ We often see an exacerbation of inequality after a disaster. ” Puerto Rico is a case in point . More than 600,000 customers are still in the dark as of Monday afternoon after Hurricane Fiona swept over the island last week .

So the full damage of a storm isn ’ t just a function of wind and water , but how people prepare and how quickly they recover .

"But the idea that Trump’s legal entanglements have added a creatine boost to his campaign is not just unsupported by its own evidence, it also ignores the growing indications that the opposite is true: Voters take the charges quite seriously. A CNN poll from late August shows that, just among Republican voters, 13 percent say the charges, if true, disqualify Trump from the presidency—a small number, yes, but more than enough to completely sink his chances of victory in a general election. For the electorate at large, the picture is even more dire for Trump: Numerous polls shows a majority of the country support the indictments, and even more voters say he should no longer be eligible to serve if convicted. There is rarely one, clean explanation for anything that happens in American politics, and that’s quite clearly the case with Trump’s enduring lead in the 2024 primaries. The decision to attribute Trump’s strength to the indictments, then, is a choice the chattering class is making, plucked from the ether. It’s not hard to see why many in the establishment media have come around to this mystical notion: For as long as Trump has been in the spotlight, members of the media and political establishment have constantly predicted his demise. The latest inflection point came after the Democrats’ surprising showing in the 2022 midterms, when the headlines were awash with the takeaway that Trump was washed and DeSantis was the big winner. The Times concluded that DeSantis’s political career was “supercharged.” Others maintained that the governor was on the verge of “wrestling control of the GOP from Trump.” Conservative media was (not for the first time!) said to be on the verge of dumping Trump. Jonathan Chait noted, “DeSantis has the advantage of a unified conservative-movement apparatus behind him.”",0
"It used to be a cliché of British public life that left-wing radicals would eventually find themselves transformed into harmless “national treasures.” The Labour politician Tony Benn went through this process of absorption after retiring as an MP, when there was no longer any question that he might exercise power and use it to transform British society. Many people wondered if Jeremy Corbyn would receive the same treatment after Labour’s defeat in the 2019 general election. However, it looks as if Britain can no longer afford this particular heritage industry in straitened economic times. Nearly four years after he stepped down as Labour leader, any suggestion by a mainstream pundit that Corbyn might not have been so bad after all is likely to provoke a reaction from their colleagues that brings to mind Donald Sutherland’s unearthly shriek in the final scene from Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The filmmaker Ken Loach has been on the receiving end of similar treatment lately. Loach has just released what he says will be his final film, The Old Oak, at the age of eighty-seven, having contributed to Britain’s film and television culture since the 1960s. A close look at the effort to blacken Loach’s name on spurious grounds tells us a lot about the standards governing public debate in Britain. Zero Tolerance In a radio interview with Loach to discuss The Old Oak, the BBC journalist Jo Coburn quoted from a statement that described him as being “appalling in his antisemitism denial.” For Coburn, the fact that this statement existed at all was reason enough to cite it on national radio. She seemed taken aback when Loach demanded that she provide evidence to substantiate the claim or else withdraw it. The accusatory statement came from the self-styled Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA), which is actually a small right-wing pressure group that specializes in denouncing critics of Israel. The Labour MP Margaret Hodge condemned the organization last year when it turned its fire on Corbyn’s successor Keir Starmer: I’m fed up of CAA using antisemitism as a front to attack Labour. Time to call them out for what and who they really are. More concerned with undermining Labour than rooting out antisemitism. This has always been an accurate description of the CAA, which did not undergo a sudden transformation when Starmer took over from Corbyn, although politicians like Hodge were happy to make use of the media firestorms it generated between 2015 and 2019. A close look at the effort to blacken Loach’s name on spurious grounds tells us a lot about the standards governing public debate in Britain. Coburn’s interview wasn’t the first time someone has been unable to respond when asked to justify attacks on Loach with evidence rather than an appeal to authority. Earlier this year, Labour announced that it was blocking the candidacy of Jamie Driscoll, a Labour mayor in England’s North East. The official rationale for doing so was that Driscoll had appeared at a public event with Loach in Newcastle to discuss the director’s films. According to Labour’s current leadership team, Loach is such a toxic figure that anyone who shares a platform with him is unsuitable for public office. In reality, Labour apparatchiks wanted to stop Driscoll from running again because he is a left-wing social democrat who supported Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. This move forms part of a much wider purge directed against left-wing candidates. However, Labour’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves stuck doggedly to the official line when the Guardian journalist Simon Hattenstone asked her about the row. It’s well worth reading the exchange between Hattenstone and Reeves in full: I tell her I am Jewish and that I agree with a zero-tolerance approach to antisemitism, but the party is so gung-ho that it is now labelling people antisemitic who simply aren’t — and there is a danger of destroying lives in the process. “Well, look, I’m not on the bodies that make those decisions, so I don’t know the details of that case. But it is so important that we are seen to — and we do — tackle antisemitism. Ken Loach, you might like his films, but his views . . . well, certainly, they are not ones I share.” That doesn’t make him antisemitic, I say. “You don’t think Ken Loach is antisemitic? OK. Well, I think we might have to agree to differ.” Why does she think he is antisemitic? “Look, I’m not on the bodies that make these decisions, but I think it’s right we have a zero-tolerance approach,” she repeats. You can’t make such an accusation without supporting it, I say. “Well, look, I’m not on the body who makes these decisions,” she repeats yet again. Loach later tells me there was no due process in his expulsion: he was just told he was unfit to be a party member; antisemitism wasn’t mentioned. Reeves clearly wanted to imply that Loach was antisemitic without having to spell it out, let alone provide evidence in support of her claims. A less scrupulous interviewer would probably have allowed her to do so. By probing what Reeves had said, ever so gently, Hattenstone obliged her to make a formal accusation of the utmost gravity while simultaneously admitting that she had no idea what she was talking about. Good Advice Rachel Reeves clearly wanted to imply that Ken Loach was antisemitic without having to spell it out, let alone provide evidence in support of her claims. Shortly after the Guardian interview was published, Driscoll announced that he was going to run for the position of North East mayor as a left-wing independent against the official Labour candidate, and soon raised a substantial campaign fund. Reeves now claimed to be fully conversant with the facts of the case: “Jamie Driscoll against good advice, shared a platform with people who had been expelled from the Labour Party for anti-Semitism. And I’m not going to make any apologies for that tough stance on anti-Semitism.” Driscoll brushed this argument aside with contempt: Ken Loach was not kicked out of the Labour Party for anti-Semitism. He is a highly respected British filmmaker who recently received a standing ovation at Cannes. His latest film “The Old Oak” set in the North East, was partially funded by the BBC. He recently got invited to meet the Pope in the Sistine Chapel — is Rachel Reeves saying Pope Francis is anti-Semitic? Someone should ask her. Driscoll went on to accuse the Labour leadership of blatant hypocrisy, noting that Starmer himself had appeared in one of Loach’s nonfiction films, “and even used footage from this in his leadership campaign video.” A member of Labour’s shadow cabinet, Ed Miliband, had also interviewed Loach about his filmmaking career for a podcast: “Will they be forced to explain their actions and blocked from standing for public office?” The dispute over Driscoll’s candidacy triggered a fresh round of debate about Loach’s record in the British press and on social media. If you dip your toe in these waters, you’ll soon come across strident assertions that Loach supports Holocaust denial. The story of how this absurd claim took shape is an unedifying case study of how to generate smoke without fire. Let’s start with a 2017 op-ed from the New York Times by the novelist Howard Jacobson. Jacobson presented the Labour conference of that year, the third to be held under Corbyn’s leadership, as an antisemitic horror show that culminated in the following shameful incident: “A motion to question the truth of the Holocaust was proposed.” On closer inspection, the episode to which Jacobson referred wasn’t a motion, it wasn’t at the conference, and it didn’t question the truth of the Holocaust — quite the hat trick of inaccuracy.",0

"The biggest challenge posed by the far right in Ireland is convincing yourself to take it seriously. It must be done but it’s not easy. There is even a strange comfort that one of the two Irish novels shortlisted for this year’s Booker prize, Paul Lynch’s gripping Prophet Song, imagines an Ireland of the near future in which a far-right party has taken power. Comforting because the book demands quite an effort of the imagination. Lynch makes this possibility chillingly real, but it is a reality that, as of now, only a very good novelist could create. Last week, 200-odd (some very odd) demonstrators in effect blockaded the seat of parliament in Dublin for most of an afternoon, preventing members from entering or leaving. They erected a mock gallows bedecked with pictures of leading members of all the main Irish political parties. The effigy hung from it had pictures of both the commissioner of police and the minister for children, equality and integration, who is particularly hated by the far right because he is both Green and gay. They shouted racist abuse at people of colour passing by, threw plastic bags filled with urine at two women, and a young American on her first day as a parliamentary intern had her phone stolen. The incident was undoubtedly nasty, and all the more disturbing because Ireland has managed to endure as one of the few developed countries in which the far right has no real foothold. It is one of a handful of nations whose political centre of gravity has shifted to the left in the last decade. It has done so even as it has been transformed from a country with almost no immigration to one in which 20% of the population is made up of people who were born somewhere else.",0

"In what could be one of the Covid era’s most abrupt reversals of political fortune, polls on New Zealand’s election on 14 October suggest voters appear ready to abandon the country’s centre-left government – once wildly popular – in favour of a centre-right coalition whose policies would permanently draw a line under the Jacinda Ardern era of politics. With the major parties, leftwing Labour and rightwing National, tussling over the centre, it is not a clear surge of favour for rightwing politics driving the shift. Instead, New Zealanders – exhausted by the pandemic, a cost of living crisis and frustration with their leaders – are mulling a shift to the right in what some analysts have deemed a “change” election. “If you’re a voter and you’ve had nearly six years of a Labour government and the cost of fruit and veggies is really high and they’re not implementing a wealth tax,” says Lamia Imam, a political commentator and a former Labour staffer, “then why wouldn’t you be like, ‘Hey, I just want something different’ and see what happens?”",0

""""""" French president Emmanuel Macron will face off against the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in the country ’ s April 24 presidential runoff . It is a rematch of sorts of the 2017 election . But the dynamics that gave voters a reprise of the Macron-Le Pen matchup reveal deeper shifts in French politics : a collapse of traditional parties , a mainstreaming of right-wing discourse , and a disunity among the left . All bring a degree of uncertainty to the election this Sunday , even if Macron is now favored to win . Maybe nothing exemplifies this more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstream center-right and center-left parties in the first round of the elections on April 10 . The candidates for the traditionally center-right Republicans finished behind two far-right candidates — Le Pen , of the National Rally , and the more extreme Éric Zemmour and his Reconquête party . The traditionally center-left Socialist candidate was demolished by the left-wing populist , Jean-Luc Mélenchon of La France Insoumise . In both cases , it was not all that close . “ We are absolutely seeing the collapse of the former mainstream right and former mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really striking way , ” said Sarah Wiliarty , an associate professor of government , specializing in Western European politics , at Wesleyan University . Macron himself may be the biggest reason for the struggles of the mainstream parties , having captured the political center . He is pro-environment , pro-LGBTQ rights , and pro-European project . But , on the economy , he is much more the pro-business , lower-taxes type . “ He stole from the moderates from the left and on the right , ” said Rainbow Murray , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of London . “ And the moderates , of course , are where the average voter is. ” This year , Le Pen built off her position in the 2017 runoffs by trying to frame herself as more mainstream . Some experts said the far-right ’ s ascendance has pulled the entire political discourse rightward in France . Rim-Sarah Alouane , a researcher in comparative law at Toulouse 1 Capitole University in France , said the “ normalization ” of the far-right has allowed more mainstream parties to absorb versions of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and integration into French society . But , since 2017 , Le Pen has put even more effort into softening the edges of her extremist rhetoric and elevating a populist message that still captures a lot of the right . If you ’ re a voter who finds a message like Le Pen ’ s appealing , “ do you , ” as Wiliarty put it , “ go for a watered-down version from the Republicans ? Or do you go for the real deal ? ” All of that has combined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Le Pen . Unlike last time , Macron has been tested in office — and at times , faced real resistance to his agenda . Though Macron ’ s lock on a second term isn ’ t as sure as some experts expected , as Sunday approaches , he is building about a 10 percentage-point lead in polls . A lot will depend on the voters whose candidates didn ’ t make it through the first round , specifically those who supported Mélenchon , who came in third . The question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ — if they support anyone at all . Macron ’ s agenda has proven to be more right-of-center , which leaves some leftist voters with two less-than-satisfactory choices . Macron has tried to broaden his appeal on the left as April 24 gets closer . But this election may be less about a vote for Macron than about a vote against Le Pen . Sunday ’ s contest may turn on how many voters make that choice — and whether it will be enough to give Macron a real mandate to govern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who could barely beat Le Pen , then that ’ s going to make it much harder for him to push things through , ” Murray said . “ So he needs to win . But he needs to win credibly. ” The headliners are the same as 2017 , but the showdown isn ’ t In the first round of France ’ s presidential elections , on April 10 , Macron won just shy of 28 percent of the vote . Le Pen came in second , with a tiny bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left-wing candidate , fell just short of a spot in the runoff , with 22 percent . Everybody else delivered single-digit results . The results are maybe not that unexpected . While experts said it ’ s pretty remarkable that France ’ s mainstream left and right parties have practically disappeared on the national level ( it ’ s a little more nuanced in local politics ) , political parties are traditionally a bit weaker in France , and party affiliation and organization is less deeply rooted than in other parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragmentation , if not to the same degree . ) Macron , after all , created his own party , La République En Marche . In 2018 , Le Pen renamed the far-right National Front , whose leadership she inherited from her even-more-radical father , to the National Rally . It is a sign that the parties may be mutable , and that the pull comes more from the candidates and their politics . But Le Pen and Macron are not running as exactly the same politicians they were in 2017 . Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has tried to detoxify some of her party ’ s politics to appeal to more mainstream voters . She has emphasized economic issues , like protecting French workers . She ’ s also tried to tweak her most controversial policies . For example , she has shifted from calling for an aggressive curtailing of immigration , instead supporting a referendum for France to decide . She also no longer wants France to leave the EU , but does still want to implement policies to vastly weaken it . This “ un-demonization ” strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . “ The heart , the soul of the far-right is still rotten to the core , ” Alouane said . “ It ’ s still the same party , but with a different face . It ’ s plastic surgery. ” If political plastic surgery was the strategy , Le Pen looked even more mainstream compared to the more radical right-wing party that arose alongside of her , which did push the kind of racist , overly anti-immigrant rhetoric that Le Pen had tried to edit . Zemmour , the candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of media attention — which may have helped Le Pen escape some scrutiny . “ She was both clever and got lucky , ” Wiliarty said . ( Zemmour received about 7 percent of the vote in the first round , and has endorsed Le Pen for the runoff . ) Macron also isn ’ t the same candidate as in 2017 . Then , Macron was the “ wunderkind , ” a political outsider-ish who managed to be a sort of anti-establishment establishmentarian , promising a pragmatic and anti-populist presidency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wake of Brexit and Trump , and he was framed as an antidote to both . Now , he ’ s got a term in office for voters to scrutinize . “ It ’ s easier for the other candidates to attack him . He ’ s in a weaker position now than he was in 2017 , ” said Francesca Vassallo , an associate professor of political science at the University of Southern Maine , who studies French and European politics . The populist “ yellow vest ” uprising threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The protests began in 2018 over a proposed fuel tax hike , framed as an effort to reduce France ’ s dependence on fossil fuels , but morphed into larger grievances about France ’ s economy and Macron as a president for the rich — especially as Macron took actions like abolishing a wealth tax . Then , Covid-19 consumed Macron ’ s presidency , and now , the crisis in Ukraine , along with price hikes because of inflation . Though this may not be surprising from a guy who started his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his perceived arrogance . France ’ s post-Covid-19 economic recovery has been strong , and Macron has delivered on promises to attract business and tech . But Macron ’ s policies of tax cuts and welfare and pension reform have contrasted sharply with the national mood , where French voters are worried about price increases . As experts said , his policy manifesto looks a lot like what you ’ d expect from a center-right Republican . “ His ideological shift in both economic and social terms has been towards the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle . But is that enough ? Macron , in 2017 , trounced Le Pen , winning about two-thirds of the vote . He appealed to the middle — on the right and the left . But he also was the new guy , who promised an untested vision . Even for many left-wing voters who may not have loved all of his policies , he was a clear alternative to Le Pen ’ s extremism . The wild card is whether that will hold true in 2022 . The fear is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opted for Mélenchon , will be disillusioned . “ Macron or Le Pen , we ’ re screwed in any case . For my first election , I ’ d hoped for better , ” an 18-year-old student and Mélenchon voter told France24 . About a quarter of French voters abstained in the first round on April 10 , and the fear is that will happen again in the runoff . In particular , Mélenchon ’ s bloc of voters might abstain , or may even opt for Le Pen , seeing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macron ’ s technocratic one . Mélenchon , the left-wing candidate , has told his supporters to vote against Le Pen — but he has also stopped short of backing Macron . A recent poll showed a pretty even breakdown of Mélenchon voters , splitting into thirds on whether they will abstain , vote Macron , or vote Le Pen in the second round . There was an assumption , likely made by Macron himself , that he could take the left for granted , “ and they will support him because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray said . “ Which is an assumption that ’ s now being challenged because he ’ s now facing abstention from the left rather than supporting him against Le Pen , ” she added . Macron himself seems to be recognizing his missteps , and has tried to correct course on the campaign trail . Take his pension reform proposal , which included raising the retirement age to 65 from 62 . As experts pointed out , this probably isn ’ t a great policy to ever introduce before a national election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s open to a more incremental timeline , or raising the age to 64 . The question is whether Macron ’ s late-game pivot will be enough . Macron and Le Pen squared off in a debate Wednesday night , their only meeting before the vote . Macron dug into Le Pen ’ s ties to Vladimir Putin , a particularly salient issue amid the Ukraine war . Le Pen tried to frame Macron as out of touch . In 2017 , Macron ’ s debate performance was decisive in his victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also seen as having the edge ; in at least one snap poll , 59 percent of people said Macron was the most convincing in the debate . In the end , Macron may have done enough to secure a second term . Macron remains ahead in the polls , and many voters do understand the threat of Le Pen . Alouane said , in broad terms , especially for France ’ s most vulnerable , it is a “ vote that stinks versus vote that kills. ” But maybe , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person isn ’ t really the same as voting for a person . Macron may eke out a win , but that is unlikely to vanquish Le Pen and the far-right , and it may mean Macron begins his second term as a far weaker president . And that may not just be based on Sunday ’ s results . As experts pointed out , France ’ s future will also be decided in the elections for France ’ s National Assembly later this spring . Experts said that if Macron wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to win control of the Assembly , but likely not with the majorities he had in 2017 . But , experts added , if Le Pen wins on Sunday , it may be the type of shock that fully rattles the electorate . “ It is very likely that will be a strong backlash against her and her party , ” Vassallo said . “ And so people would vote for other parties and not for hers . This means she will be a president without having a political majority in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” If that happens , it would restrain Le Pen ’ s domestic agenda , and make her a fairly weak president . But president nonetheless . """"""",0

"What are the prospects for the opposition coalition to form a government? Polish President Andrzej Duda will likely allow the incumbent Law and Justice Party (PiS) government and its current Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to try and form a new government, as they remain the largest single party in parliament. But they are likely to fall short of a majority. The opposition Civic Coalition, led by former Prime Minister Donald Tusk, would then be in a good position to form a new government, although the opposition could still face challenges. Tusk will need his own centrist political alliance to find common ground with the left-wing Lewica and center-right Third Way blocs. The glue that binds these three together—their joint aversion to the democratic backsliding under two consecutive PiS-led governments—should prove stronger than what divides them, issues including abortion, social housing, and protection for farmers. So, while President Duda, who ran as an independent but has support from the PiS government, could slow the process down, Poland can probably expect a new Tusk-led government in December 2023.",0

The crypto trades create another wrinkle in the debate over potential conflicts of interest in Congress . The cryptocurrency industry is ramping up its lobbying machine as lawmakers and regulators weigh new rules for the sector .

"The cost of living crisis has been happening for so long now, it can no longer really be classed as a “crisis”. Crisis implies urgency, emergency, a state that cannot go on without intervention. But when that is not forthcoming, crisis simply becomes the new normal; especially if politicians treat it as such. You would be forgiven for thinking it didn’t exist at all if you followed Conservative party conference last week. The prime minister’s speech seemed to be addressed to another nation altogether, one in which our main issues are how people identify their gender, small boat crossings, and green diktats. Those struggling are reduced to the “hardest hit” and are used to justify whatever policy he is trying to block or promote, without ever acknowledging what they are going through. The cost of living crisis is a crisis of not being able to eat, stay warm or provide for your children. Food banks have become such an established fixture of the nation’s support system that they are, as Gordon Brown has warned, “taking over from the welfare state”. There are now also the grimly named “warm banks” – pubs, libraries and community halls where people can go to shelter from the cold, heat food and charge devices. At “baby banks”, new mothers cluster with their infants for nappies and other essentials. Then there are “bedding banks”, providing bedding for children who make up some of the million people in the UK who sleep on the floor or who have to share a bed with siblings or parents because replacing broken bed frames or mouldy linen has become a luxury.",0

Gulagu.net , founded by Vladimir Osechkin , reports that the final straw appears to have been the brutal sledgehammer-execution video released by Russia ’ s private army last week—a stomach-churning extrajudicial killing that the Kremlin politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman thought to be behind it uses it for his own PR campaign . “ The reprisal with the use of a sledgehammer and the cruelty of [ Wagner Group founder Yevgeny ] Prigozhin , with the tacit consent of Putin , had an unexpected effect : for the third day , there is a steady stream of messages to the Gulagu.net hotline from employees of the Interior Ministry , the [ Investigative Committee ] , the FSB and the [ Federal Protective Service ] , the Federal Bailiff Service , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawlessness and cruelty , ” Gulagu.net reported . While rumblings of discontent among the Russian security services have been reported throughout the war , frustrations have reportedly boiled over as Putin is increasingly seen as losing all control . In less than two weeks , there was Russia ’ s humiliating retreat from Kherson—the Ukrainian territory that Putin and so many of his mouthpieces had vowed would be part of Russia “ forever. ” Then came the brutal execution video by members of the Wagner Group , the same private army that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bringing victory to Putin by any means necessary . And then came the Russian-made missile that landed in Poland this week , killing two farmers there shortly after similar missiles fired by Russia cut down Ukrainian civilians in the latest bombardment . While Western officials have since walked back their claims that the Polish farmers were killed by a missile fired by Russia , the incident initially seemed likely to trigger a direct confrontation between Russia ’ s military and NATO forces . And that reportedly left some within the Russian security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove Putin from power entirely . That ’ s according to unconfirmed reporting by the Telegram channel General SVR , an anonymous channel that claims to be run by a former member of the security services . “ The incident with a missile hitting Poland on Tuesday almost became a prologue to the seizure of power in Russia , ” the channel reported Thursday , claiming that high-ranking security officials had gathered in the immediate aftermath of the strike for “ informal consultations. ” “ Knowing Putin 's penchant for raising the stakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly became convinced that in response to a Russian strike on a country included in NATO there could be both a retaliatory strike and an ultimatum. ” So , according to the channel , they decided that “ if the U.S. leadership and the adjoining countries show readiness for a harsh response , then the best way out would be to remove the current Russian president , Vladimir Putin , from power and create a collegial council of security officials to ‘ temporarily ’ take control of the country into their own hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seriously ill or law-breaking president. ” Noting that Putin has brought tension “ to almost the limit , ” the channel warned : “ This time , the critical situation turned out to be illusory and it made no sense for the security forces to take risks , but next time , and there will be a next time , Putin may not have a chance. ” While panic over the missile incident has largely fizzled out , the same can not be said for Prigozhin ’ s growing influence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A former member of the security services who fled the country told Deutsche Welle late last month that concerns were growing inside federal agencies about the power given to some figures within Putin ’ s inner circle . “ The state is not thinking about its people , it ’ s only thinking about itself and its close associates , ” she said , describing them as “ gangsters. ” Perhaps in a sign of things to come , Putin on Thursday seemed to signal he has no plans to listen to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution him against escalation . Instead , he purged the Kremlin ’ s Human Rights Council of all the experts who raised questions about the war and the public execution of defector Yevgeny Nuzhin , replacing them with a hardliner war reporter and other Kremlin loyalists .

""""""" In the final week of the 2020 elections , a Biden campaign bus departed San Antonio on the last afternoon of a three-day Texas tour . The bus had already encountered intimidation and harassment from Trump supporters on the state ’ s highways , where so-called “ Trump Trains ” stalked the bus . But on the final day , the Trump Trains planned to go big . As the bus headed down Interstate 35 , dozens of trucks bearing Trump flags converged . At first , police cars held them at bay . But when the bus crossed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escort receded and no new help arrived . The trucks formed a moving barrier and forced the bus to a crawl , trying to push it onto the shoulder . One Trump supporter guided his truck into the vehicle of a staffer following the bus , causing a collision . By the time the bus finally escaped by making a last-minute exit from the highway at 70 miles per hour , according to those on board , its passengers and others driving alongside it had been made to fear for their lives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned events . Video of the incident soon went viral on Twitter , but didn ’ t fully convey the terror of the attack . When President Donald Trump tweeted it along with the words “ I LOVE TEXAS ! , ” it had a fight song added for effect . He called the attackers “ patriots. ” A few months later , on January 6 , he rallied “ patriots ” to march on the Capitol and , after they sacked it , told them , “ We love you. ” The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus are just two recent incidents that have pushed prosecutors , civil rights lawyers , and public interest groups to seize on a statute enacted some 150 years before Congress ’ doors and windows were breached . The law commonly known as the Ku Klux Klan Act was passed in 1871 , at a time when the United States also confronted a rise in political violence threatening democratic governance . The sweeping law took aim at Southern vigilantes who used intimidation and violence to thwart not only their political opponents , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule of law . Today , a statute crafted to keep the Klan from imposing its political agenda is being used against modern violent groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys and those who conspire with them—including Trump supporters . If the courts see fit , the law could become a powerful tool to defeat the rising tide of violence and election subversion threatening American democracy . Since Trump came to and left office , the Klan Act has fueled a wide range of litigation , including three voter-suppression cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017 , two over the highway assault in Texas , and seven cases against perpetrators of January 6 . Some target Trump himself . Most recently , Ukraine expert Lt . Colonel Alexander Vindman sued Trump and three close associates under the Klan Act for reprisal and intimidation surrounding his testimony during Trump ’ s first impeachment . The Klan Act was Congress ’ response to extreme political violence in the South , where former Confederates were bent on destroying the Republican Party and maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dismantle . “ It was guerrilla warfare , ” says Robert Kaczorowski , a professor emeritus of law and legal history at Fordham University School of Law , and “ the Klan and other organizations were paramilitary wings of the Democratic Party , ” then the party of white supremacy . Across the South , Black people and their white Republican allies lived in terror of violence . Black men slept in the woods to hide from Klan raids . In South Carolina , when white confederate sympathizers failed to dislodge Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized control of the northwest corner of the state with a stream of raids , beatings , and murders . Across the South , the Klan and other white supremacist groups sought to undo Reconstruction by attacking Black people , white Republicans , and local Republican leaders . When prosecuted , they did not allow the court system to get in their way ; witnesses were intimidated , judges were murdered , and juries were generally filled with Klan members or sympathizers . In Reconstruction : America ’ s Unfinished Revolution , 1863–1877 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Meridian , Mississippi , shortly before Congress enacted the Klan Act , that illustrates the violent lawlessness that reigned : “ Three black leaders were arrested in March 1871 on charges of delivering ‘ incendiary ’ speeches . Firing broke out at their court hearing , the Republican judge and two defendants were killed , and a day of rioting followed , which saw perhaps thirty blacks murdered in cold blood , including ‘ all the leading colored men of the town with one or two exceptions. ’ ” The same month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealed to President Ulysses S. Grant for assistance , unable to control the violence in his state . Grant asked Congress to step in . In the face of such violence , legislators passed the Ku Klux Klan Act in April , crafting it to restore order and democracy to the South with a force that met the breadth of the problem . The act banned conspiracies to interfere with , intimidate , or harm federal officers in the course of their work , citizens on account of their support for federal political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings . It also forbade conspiracies to overthrow the federal government and to prevent the execution of the law . Importantly , the law created civil as well as criminal liability , which gave citizens the right to sue their aggressors and win large cash settlements . The law also granted the president the authority—which expired after one year—to temporarily declare martial law and suspend habeas corpus . In October 1871 , Grant used this provision to send troops into South Carolina where , as Army Major Lewis Merrill had reported , Klan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime not paralleled in the history of any civilized community. ” Meanwhile , Grant ’ s attorney general , Amos Akerman , used the new law to prosecute the Klan across the South . “ By 1872 , the federal government ’ s evident willingness to bring its legal and coercive authority to bear had broken the Klan ’ s back and produced a dramatic decline in violence , ” Foner wrote . “ So ended the Reconstruction career of the Ku Klux Klan. ” But when the government turned away from Reconstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade later , the Supreme Court ruled that its criminal penalties for conspiracy to deprive people of equal protection was unconstitutional ; a decade later , as the country entered an era of racist voter disenfranchisement , Congress repealed the Klan Act ’ s criminal penalties that protected voters targeted for their support or advocacy for federal candidates . With few exceptions , the Klan Act lay fallow from the time of Reconstruction until the Trump era . “ In the late 20th and early 21st century , we didn ’ t live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem of organized violence interfering with federal governance . We had a pretty stable system , ” says Richard Primus , a legal history scholar at the University of Michigan Law School . “ Because the Trump administration presented the country with threats to normal constitutional government of a kind that we had not seen in a long time , a set of tools that hadn ’ t been apropos for a long time became apropos again. ” The Klan Act seems to outlaw kinds of political violence pushed by Trump and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimidating voters and those campaigning for office to attacking federal officers performing their duties—including during the Capitol riot . Primus , who co-authored a law review article before the attack arguing that the act could play a role targeting modern-day election interference , now says that “ the law they wrote covers the January 6 cases pretty well. ” “ The January 6 cases are about trying to get legal relief against a set of people who used force to interfere with the orderly processes of federal governance—which is what the Klan Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the Unite the Right rally terrorized Charlottesville , Virginia , in August 2017 , attorney Roberta Kaplan had just started a new law firm and saw an opportunity to use the Klan Act ’ s authorization of civil suits and penalties to hold the perpetrators accountable . She and her colleagues flew in from New York soon after to put together a case representing people who had been harmed during the violent demonstration . With the help of Integrity First for America , a civil rights nonprofit , and her friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law firm Paul Weiss , it took Kaplan ’ s team four years to reach trial . In November , the jury found the rally organizers guilty of conspiracy to incite racially motivated violence and awarded the victims $ 26 million . While the jury deadlocked on the Klan Act violations , it convicted on substantively identical state claims , making it a demonstration of the potential of using the courts to extract crippling financial penalties from people or groups that push racial terrorism . Using the Klan Act to go after people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to protect symbols of white supremacy—has poetic justice . Kaplan calls the defendants in her case the “ modern-day equivalent ” of the Ku Klux Klan , and describes how their racism and anti-Semitism permeated proceedings . “ I never thought I would go to a trial where it ’ s no exaggeration for me to say that Mein Kampf came up every day. ” But unlike the Ku Klux Klan of old , she points out that the men in her trial “ rather than having to meet in the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media. ” While the shift from the forests to the internet let white supremacists plan and grow their ranks nationwide , it also left digital records that have proven critical to today ’ s Klan Act cases . After the Unite the Right rally , leaked logs from the Discord chat app helped Kaplan and her colleagues build their case . The Klan act bus cases in Texas and in response to January 6 likewise rely on the massive amount of online evidence—including Trump ’ s tweets—that conspirators shared prior to and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Racine , the attorney general of Washington , DC , used social media records in filing a suit under the Klan Act against the Proud Boys , Oath Keepers , and more than two dozen individual perpetrators of the January 6 attack , detailing how the city and its police officers were injured . The case seeks punitive monetary damages , and Racine has touted its potential to destroy these white supremacist groups and individuals by hitting “ where it counts ” and taking away their money . The verdict in Charlottesville “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Racine said shortly after filing . The crafters of the Klan Act ’ s provisions prohibiting interference with federal agents performing their duties aimed to protect agents of the law who were arresting , prosecuting , and trying Klan members . They did not envision that the agents could be members of Congress . But by invading the Capitol to stop Congress and the vice president from certifying the 2020 election results , the January 6 rioters and co-conspirators—including Trump—opened themselves up to suits from anyone in the building doing their federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol Police officers have taken the opportunity to file pending suits . Weeks after the insurrection , 11 Democratic representatives sued Trump , Giuliani , the Oath Keepers , the Proud Boys , Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio , and a new corporate entity supporting him and the group , in a separate lawsuit brought by the NAACP . Shortly thereafter , Rep. Eric Swalwell ( D-Calif. ) sued Trump , Donald Trump Jr. , Rudy Giuliani , and Rep. Mo Brooks ( R-Ala. ) under the act for conspiring to stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In April 2021 , three Capitol Police officers brought Klan Act suits against Trump , followed in August by a suit from eight Capitol Police officers against Trump , the Proud Boys , Oath Keepers , and multiple individual insurrectionists . The cases rely on the perpetrators ’ significant online trail as well as evidence that Trump and his associates not only planned the rally , but monitored social media channels where attack planning took place . On February 18 , DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta—simultaneously considering the suits from members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police officers—ruled that Klan Act charges against Trump , the Oath Keepers , and Tarrio could move forward . He dismissed the charges against Giuliani and Trump Jr . In Texas , the two Klan Act cases responding to the harassment of Biden ’ s campaign bus could showcase the legal potential of other parts of the law , including its remaining civil provisions protecting those engaged in “ support or advocacy ” of a candidate for federal office . The bus attack , which threatened people working on a presidential campaign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seem to be a textbook example of such a violation . Once the bus had escaped the Trump Train , its driver took it out of Texas—literally driven out of the state by fear and the threat of violence . If modern-day vigilantes undertake similar intimidation of campaigns and voters , a ruling against the harassers could be a blueprint to combating it . A second Texas case , filed by the same four people—the driver , a surrogate , and a staffer on board the bus , as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city that refused to protect the bus is being brought under provisions that could prove to be an even more powerful tool against future violence or election interference . While other jurisdictions ’ police forces kept the pro-Trump drivers at bay , San Marcos law enforcement officials decided not to protect the bus . While in San Marcos , and “ without police to temper them , Trump Train drivers surrounded the bus on all sides , playing a madcap game of highway ‘ chicken , ’ coming within three to four inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleges . No help came , despite phone calls to the city ’ s police from campaign staff and volunteers both on and off the bus , as well as unaffiliated drivers who witnessed the harassment . “ We ’ re not going to escort a bus , ” one defendant , a corporal with the San Marcos Police , told the emergency dispatcher on a recorded emergency call . The decision to do nothing , alleges the lawsuit , is prohibited under the Klan Act , which includes an affirmative duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to help prevent an illegal conspiracy under the law to take action to prevent it . In order to root out violent conspiracies and election interference in the late 1800s , “ Congress specifically imposed a duty on all Americans to protect targets of political intimidation and violence in federal elections , ” the suit states . The provision may be especially potent when brought against law enforcement in areas where , as in the Reconstruction era , local officials with the knowledge and ability to prevent such harm may be inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample reasons city officials should have known they needed to act : Not only were they warned directly at least 24 hours ahead of time by a Biden campaign affiliate and entreated repeatedly for assistance as the attack unfolded , advance coordination had publicly taken place on Facebook , was circulated by its planners , and reported in the media . At events and on the highway over the preceding two days , Trump supporters had already pursued and harassed the Biden campaign—including at the urging of Donald Trump Jr . The Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical parallel . In the 1980s , a Freedom Rider who was severally beaten in Alabama in 1961 successfully sued the federal government under the Klan Act after he learned that FBI agents had been aware of plans to attack the bus he and other activists were riding but did nothing to stop it . Several of the modern Klan Act cases make a the same claim in their suits , including Washington , DC ’ s case against organizers of the January 6 attack . Those planning a conspiracy , these suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law for failing to try to stop it . The argument demonstrates how the law ’ s uncommon duty to act provisions could spread liability to a wide number of people who , in the future , might fail to take action to prevent a conspiracy targeting an election with acts of intimidation or violence . On January 6 , 2021 , Kevin Seefried attended Trump ’ s “ Save America ” rally and followed the president ’ s instructions to go to the Capitol , where he entered carrying the Confederate battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the Senate chamber quickly became some of the most indelible and disturbing images of the attack . As William Blair , professor emeritus of history at Penn State , told the New York Times shortly afterward , “ the Confederate flag made it deeper into Washington on January 6 , 2021 , than it did during the Civil War. ” The police officers who defended the Capitol that day , including several now using the Klan act to sue their attackers and Trump , were subjected to racial slurs . Charlottesville and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacist groups play a significant and violent role in Trump ’ s base of support , but also that the country ’ s struggle to remain democratic looks in part like a struggle not to fall backward into Jim Crow . With the political and racial violence that threatened democracy 150 years ago rising again , the Klan Act is getting a second chance to quell this latest resurgence . """"""",0

Ohio ’ s Senate Bill 23 was signed into law back in April 2019 by Gov . Mike DeWine , a Republican , before a federal judge blocked it from being enforced three months later .

Ohio would be “ irreparably harmed ” by any delay in dissolving the injunction , Yost had argued . Ohio abortion providers responded by filing a lawsuit asking the state ’ s Supreme Court to find the new six-week ban unconstitutional and restore the previous 22-week abortion ban .

"I suppose some readers will have a hard time getting past the cover of The Controversialist, the new memoir by Martin Peretz, longtime editor of the New Republic. First there's the cover photo. It shows the author recumbent and smiling and sprouting a wooly thatch of chest hair from the opening of a linen shirt. Martin Peretz is 84 years old. This whole unpleasantness could have been avoided if Peretz had not persisted in his lifelong habit of leaving the second or even third button of his shirts unbuttoned. In the book itself, he says this look, which I guess is meant to be rakish, derives from French intellectuals like Bernard-Henri Lévy. More down-to-earth bookstore browsers will glance at the photo and instead recall long-gone, and very non-French, Vegas lounge lizards like Sammy Davis Jr. and Tony Orlando, and give it a pass. Beyond the photo, there's the problem of the title. The Controversialist would well fit a biography of Peretz by another writer, someone holding up Peretz's career of endless public bickering for objective inspection, admiring or not. But for a man to hold himself up in this third-person manner, declaring himself by implication a kind of archetype or icon, betrays a disconcerting self-regard. Imagine an ordinary Washington backbencher like, say, Ben Cardin writing an autobiography and giving it the title The Senator. It's unseemly. Muhammad Ali could write an autobiography called The Greatest and get away with it. Even discounting for religious differences, Peretz is no Muhammad Ali.",0

"The Ohio Supreme Court, in unanimously invalidating a Nov. 7 drag queen ballot issue in the city of Bellefontaine this week, also personally rebuked Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose in its ruling. LaRose had cast the tie-breaking vote Sept. 19, siding with two Logan County Board of Elections officials, that placed the measure banning public drag-queen shows on the ballot in the central Ohio town. Not only was the Supreme Court ruling unanimous against the state’s top elections official, a Republican who is running for U.S. Senate, but the high court -- dominated 4-3 by Republicans -- also issued a sharply worded denunciation of LaRose’s actions. LaRose had allowed the ballot measure to go forward even though petitioners switched the petitions’ cover sheets before submitting them, effectively adding language to petitions that hadn’t been there when voters signed them. “Secretary LaRose and the board of elections abused their discretion and disregarded the law in overruling relators’ protest.

""""""" The Iowa-class battleships are truly beautiful ships , and it is fortunate that four of them are now on display . Here ’ s What You Need to Remember : Because of their length and narrow lines , the Iowas were the pinnacle of battleship design . The North Carolina– and South Dakota–class battleships were designed with the limits of the Washington Naval Treaty in mind . Although much more could be accomplished in 1938 with thirty-five thousand tons than in 1921 , sacrifices still had to be made . As had been practice in the first round of battleship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low speed in return for heavy armor and armament . Consequently , both the South Dakotas and the North Carolinas had speeds a knot or two slower than most foreign contemporaries . The Montanas , the final battleship design authorized by the Navy , would also have had a twenty-eight-knot maximum speed . In any case , Japan ’ s failure to ratify the 1936 London Naval Treaty bumped the maximum standard tonnage from thirty-five to forty-five thousand , giving the designers some extra space to work with . The result was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-designed battleships ever built . USS Missouri , the third laid down but last completed of the Iowa class , carried a slightly heavier main armament than the South Dakotas and could make five extra knots . The Iowas were the first U.S. Navy battleships to make speed a primary value , and achieved the speed through a longer hull and more powerful machinery . Indeed , the Iowas are the fastest battleships ever built , outpacing even the Italian Littorios by a knot or two . While no Iowa ever recorded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years suggested that the battleships might be able to make thirty-five knots over short distances . Part of the rationale for building the Iowas was to have ships capable of chasing down and destroying the Japanese Kongo-class battlecruisers , themselves built in 1913 , but the Navy also wanted to ensure that it had battleships capable of keeping up with the Essex-class carriers . Missouri ’ s guns were also a step up from previous classes . The sixteen-inch/fifty-caliber could fire a heavier shell , at a longer range and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the South Dakota class . Indeed , while the 18.1-inch guns of HIJMS Yamato launched a heavier shell , the sixteenth-inch/fifty-calibers had more penetrating power and could fire at a slightly faster rate . On the downside , Missouri ’ s great length and narrow beam ( necessary for transit through the Panama Canal ) made it a mediocre seaboat in heavy oceans . USS Missouri entered service in June 1944 and joined Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ’ s Task Force 58 ( fast carrier task force ) in January 1945 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escort , although it participated in the bombardment of Okinawa in 1945 . On April 11 , it suffered superficial damage from a kamikaze strike . Adm. William “ Bull ” Halsey took Missouri as flagship of the Third Fleet in May . As U.S. carriers destroyed what remained of Japanese airpower and seapower in spring 1945 , Missouri bombarded Honshu and Kyushu directly . On August 29 , 1945 , Missouri entered Tokyo Bay and prepared to accept the Japanese surrender . On September 2 , Japanese envoys boarded Missouri and signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Allied combatants in the Pacific . After the surrender ceremony , Missouri participated in Operation Magic Carpet and some occupation-related activities , then retired the United States and training duties . In part because of the affection that President Harry S. Truman had for the ship ( he hailed from Missouri , and his daughter christened the battleship ) , Missouri remained more active than its sisters in the immediate postwar period . This included a major show-the-flag cruise in the Mediterranean , reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the security of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the Korean War , it carried out shore bombardment missions along the Korean peninsula for the better part of three years . After the war , Missouri again served as a training ship before entering reserve in 1955 . Various proposals were floated for reactivating the Iowas over the next twenty-five years . New Jersey returned to service in 1968 to bombard North Vietnam , but was soon sent back to mothballs . Some proposals in the late 1970s envisioned the replacement of the aft turret with a flight deck capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these were rejected because of high cost . At the beginning of the Reagan administration , however , funds began to flow more freely , and plans were hatched to reactivate the four remaining battleships . That the Soviets were putting into service the Kirov-class battlecruisers , the largest surface combatants in the world , helped the battleship advocates make their case . Missouri returned to service in May 1986 , less eight five-inch/thirty-eight-caliber guns , but with mounts for Harpoon and Tomahawk cruise missiles , as well as Phalanx point-defense guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the helipad ( installed in the 1950s ) , Missouri was given the capability to launch and recover unmanned drones . In 1990 , Missouri deployed as part of Operation Desert Shield , and in January it contributed to the air offensive against Iraq with several salvos of Tomahawk missiles . When the ground invasion began , Missouri and its sister Wisconsin began bombarding Iraqi positions with sixteen-inch and five-inch guns .

I was struck by the dissonance between the community ’ s connection to the land and its reliance on diesel . Diesel spills regularly , emits greenhouse emissions , is really expensive and its fumes damage their health .

There were only 48 passengers on the bus , hardly an overwhelming number of people to provide for in a city the size of Philadelphia . They were met by more than 20 immigrant activists , city officials and volunteers . The illegal aliens were given blankets and a toddler was given a puffy winter coat . Sounds good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a sanctuary city , welcoming in a very small number of newcomers , many of whom will not even remain in Philadelphia but will go on to other cities and states . Most of the arrivals on Monday were men . All aboard had crossed the border from Mexico into Texas , and all have permission to be in the United States , at least for now . The travelers originally came from Nicaragua , Cuba , Ecuador , Peru and the Dominican Republic . About 30 riders were quickly transferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be moved to a city welcome center in North Philadelphia . There they would be offered additional drinks , food , medical screenings and temporary shelter . The illegal aliens were feeling so welcomed that one man who allegedly had a broken leg wanted to go to the welcome center before he sought medical treatment . What ? This is the kind of reporting coming from the arrival of the bus . Everyone is reported to have been in good spirits and there were no medical emergencies to attend to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t a big deal . I ’ ll tell you that when I fractured my tibia , I sought immediate medical care because it hurt like hell . But , I digress . The man with the broken leg just wanted a blanket and a cup of coffee . Color me skeptical but I ’ m guessing even the man with the broken leg wants more than a blanket and a cup of coffee . The illegal aliens have already gotten their wish to remain in America until further notice , which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most say they want jobs and seek asylum . U.S. immigration law doesn ’ t consider wanting a job as reason for asylum , though . No matter . The Biden administration isn ’ t enforcing immigration law anyway . They will need housing and medical care and their children will need education benefits . The migrant bus arrived from Del Rio , Texas , just as the one six days ago did . The Mayor of Philadelphia , Jim Kenney , called it a “ despicable political stunt ” by Governor Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrant families as pawns to push ‘ a warped political agenda. ” My , my . Shouldn ’ t he have thanked the governor for sending them to his city so he can prove how open and welcoming Philadelphia is to them ? Volunteers at the welcome center said most if not all of those aboard the second bus were seeking asylum — a legal means of staying in the United States for people who may be persecuted in their homelands . Passengers told volunteers that in Texas they had been offered free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . City officials and immigrant leaders reiterated on Monday that they were preparing for more buses from Texas , without knowing when they might arrive or how many people they might carry . “ We ’ re ready , ” said Blanca Pacheco , co-director with Peter Pedemonti of New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia . It ’ s wise for them to be preparing for more . More will come . Texas has hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to distribute across the country to relieve the overcrowding at the border . DHS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , but usually very quietly and without the press coverage . DHS doesn ’ t want to upset people with the news that illegal immigrants , including unaccompanied minors , are flying into their cities in the dead of night and will end up who knows where . Philadelphia has been preparing for the migrant buses since last summer . They are even providing familiar foods for them . Amy Eusebio , executive director of the city Office of Immigrant Affairs , said officials were involved in short-term and long-term planning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek financial assistance to support the effort from the state and federal governments , though it wasn ’ t immediately clear what monies might be available . Since the summer , the Office of Immigrant Affairs and the Office of Emergency Management have been preparing for the potential arrival of migrants on unscheduled , unanticipated bus routes from Southern states . Those agencies met regularly with 15 local community-based organizations , including Juntos , HIAS Pennsylvania , the Pennsylvania Immigration and Citizenship Coalition , and Nationalities Service Center . At the welcome center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrivals with familiar foods , including arepas and empanadas , and helped them connect with family and legal resources . Most migrants did not plan to stay in Philadelphia , but to move on to join family members in other states . Activists are curious as to whether or not more buses will arrive this week , it being a holiday week and all . One activist said they may end up welcoming illegal aliens at the bus station on Thanksgiving Day . Why not ? They come from countries that don ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a special day for them . It is , though , to the Border Patrol and other law enforcement agents that work on the border 24/7 , 365 days a year . No one seems too concerned about them working on Thanksgiving .

Just something to think about as the bleeding heart liberals pushing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive praise from the media – and they most certainly do – for rewarding people who break our laws as the very first act as they enter our country . If you heard Chuck Schumer say last week that the Senate will pursue legislation for blanket amnesty for all illegal aliens in this country during the lame duck session , you know this is all intentional on the part of the Biden administration and Democrats .

"Listen 4 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save Over the past century, the period during which the House leadership saw the most intraparty turnover came in the 1930s. John Nance Garner, the head of the majority Democratic caucus, left to serve as vice president under Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. Henry Rainey took over, only to die the next August. He was succeeded by Jo Byrns, who died in 1936. Then William Bankhead became House speaker, a position he held for four years, until he died. It all has a very “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” castle vibe to it. For the next few decades, things were relatively stable. Then Republicans lost the House in the 2006 midterms. For the past 17 years, the tumult has been on the Republican side. Not because leaders slowly progressed through the ranks until, aged, they assumed the top position in their party. But because they were figuratively killed off, representations of authority in a party increasingly oriented around rejecting such authority.",0

He began his career as a lawyer. He has deployed with the U.S. military. He’s the author of many books, including “Divided We Fall: America’s Secession Threat and How to Restore Our Nation.” And I’m excited to see what he does here behind the mic. I hope you enjoy it too.

"In an Economist/YouGov poll conducted Sunday through Tuesday, 42 percent of Americans said they sympathized more with Israelis in their longstanding conflict with Palestinians, while only 9 percent picked Palestinians. Another 22 percent said their sympathies were about equal, and more than one in four, 27 percent, weren’t sure. Last week, Hamas fighters entered southern Israel at the border with the Gaza strip and raided communities there, killing more than 1,000 Israelis and taking hostage hundreds more. The killings have been decried as an act of terrorism by President Joe Biden, who has expressed U.S. support for Israel in the aftermath. But some liberal activists, including on college campuses, have argued that the killings are Israel’s fault for its government’s support of settlement expansion in the West Bank and the economic and security restrictions it has applied to Gaza. Some Democratic lawmakers have called for stronger recognition of Palestinian sovereignty in the aftermath of the war’s launch. More have urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to avoid escalation in his response.

"By Spring Magazine Fred Hahn, the President of CUPE Ontario, is under attack from all quarters for expressing support for Palestinian human rights. The pretext for this attack is some tweets Hahn sent out on Thanksgiving weekend, but the real goal of these attacks is to silence voices critical of Israel, weaken the confidence of labour, and embolden the forces of the far-right. Let’s not forget that Fred Hahn has also been on the receiving end of the most vile homophobic and transphobic vitriol for standing up to protect trans kids.

""""""" I have published two previous articles about New York Independent System Operator ( NYISO ) analyses related to New York ’ s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act ( Climate Act ) . This post describes what I believe is an important new analysis of the future of New York ’ s electric system . The implementation plan for New York ’ s Climate Act “ Net Zero ” target ( 85 % reduction and 15 % offset of emissions ) by 2050 is underway . The Climate Action Council has been working to develop plans to implement the Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York State Energy Research & Development Authority ( NYSERDA ) and its consultant Energy + Environmental Economics ( E3 ) prepared an Integration Analysis to “ estimate the economy-wide benefits , costs , and GHG emissions reductions associated with pathways that achieve the Climate Act GHG emission limits and carbon neutrality goal ” . Integration Analysis implementation strategies were incorporated into the Draft Scoping Plan when it was released at the end of 2021 . Since the end of the public comment period in early July 2022 the Climate Action Council has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the development of the Final Scoping Plan that is supposed to provide a guide for the net-zero transition . Unfortunately , the Climate Action Council has not confronted reliability issues raised by New York agencies responsible for keeping the lights on . The first post ( New York Climate Act : Is Anyone Listening to the Experts ? ) described the NYISO 2021-2030 Comprehensive Reliability Plan ( CRP ) report ( appendices ) released late last year . The difficulties raised in the report are so large that I raised the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to this expert opinion . The second post ( New York Climate Act : What the Experts are Saying Now ) highlighted results shown in a draft presentation for the 2021-2040 System & Resource Outlook that all but admitted meeting the net-zero goals of the Climate Act are impossible on the mandated schedule . This article describes the “ For discussion purposes only ” draft of the 2021-2040 System & Resource Outlook report described in the previous article . While there may be minor changes to the document itself , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not change substantively . The Executive Summary makes the point that the Climate Act is driving changes to the generating system , the transmission grid and the demand landscape . As a result , this “ leads to re-thinking how and where electric supply and storage resources evolve , and how to efficiently enable their adoption to achieve energy policy targets ” . The summary goes on to note : • Projected possible resource mixes that achieve New York ’ s public policy goals while maintaining grid reliability ; • Identified regions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be unable to generate at their full capability due to transmission constraints ; • Quantified the extent to which these transmission constraints limit delivery of renewable energy to consumers , and ; • Identified potential opportunities for transmission investment that may provide economic , policy , and/or operational benefits . Energy planning analyses such as this work normally evaluate different scenarios of the future by comparing them to a business-as-usual scenario . In this instance the business-as-usual scenario does not include any of New York ’ s climate initiatives . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan analyses were perverted to “ prove ” the desired conclusion that the benefits were greater than the costs by comparing future scenarios against a reference scenario . The Integration Analysis used a semantic trick to claim that some de-carbonization costs ( such as de-carbonizing transportation costs ) necessary to meet Climate Act targets did not have to be included in the comparison scenario because the electric vehicle conversion legislation was already “ implemented ” . That approach took legitimate implementation costs out of the projections . Of course , this also makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Draft Scoping Plan problematic . The second estimate of the future in the Resource Outlook considered only those projects currently under contract : The Outlook report noted the following Key Takeaways for the contracted renewables scenario : • The pace of renewable project development is unprecedented and requires an increase in the pace of transmission development . Every incremental advancement towards policy achievement matters on the path to a greener and reliable grid in the future , not just at the critical deadline years such as 2030 and 2040 . In general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years from development to deployment . • Coordination of project additions and retirements is essential to maintaining reliability and achieving policy . Coordination of renewable energy additions , commercialization and development of dispatchable technologies , fossil fuel plant operation , and staged fossil fuel plant deactivations over the next 18 years will be essential to facilitate an orderly transition of the grid . Many more renewable resources have to be developed to meet the overall Climate Act net-zero goal by 2050 and the interim 2040 goal of “ zero-emissions ” electricity generation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Case scenarios that meet those targets : • Scenario 1 utilizes industry data and NYISO load forecasts , representing a future with high demand ( 57,144 MW winter peak and 208,679 GWh energy demand in 2040 ) and assumes less restrictions in renewable generation buildout options . • Scenario 2 utilizes various assumptions consistent with the Climate Action Council Integration Analysis and represents a future with a moderate peak but a higher overall energy demand ( 42,301 MW winter peak and 235,731 GWh energy demand in 2040 ) . Both scenarios project a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , utility-scale solar , behind-the-meter solar , and energy storage will be needed to meet the CLCPA policy mandates through 2035 . There are significant differences between these scenarios and the equivalent Draft Scoping Plan mitigation scenarios . One of the big differences is the magnitude of a new generating resource called “ dispatchable emission-free resources ” ( DEFRs ) : As part of the analysis the NYISO considered what would be needed if the DEFR capacity is not developed . They found that “ The exclusion of DEFRs as a new technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossil generators via the zero-emission by 2040 policy , exhausts the amount of land-based wind built and results in the replacement of 45 GW of DEFR capacity in Scenario 1 with 30 GW of offshore wind and 40 GW of energy storage. ” They also noted that the alternative did not address ancillary service requirements needed for the transmission system . The Outlook report noted the following Key Takeaways for the Policy Case Scenarios : • Significant new resource development will be required to achieve CLCPA energy targets . The total installed generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York is projected to range between 111 GW and 124 GW by 2040 . At least 95 GW of this capacity will consist of new generation projects and/or modifications to existing plants . Even with these additions , New York still may not be sufficient to fully meet CLCPA compliance criteria and maintain the reliable electricity supply on which New York consumers rely . The sheer scale of resources needed to satisfy system reliability and policy requirements within the next 20 years is unprecedented . • To achieve an emission-free grid , dispatchable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed and deployed throughout New York . DEFRs that provide sustained on-demand power and system stability will be essential to meeting policy objectives while maintaining a reliable electric grid . While essential to the grid of the future , such DEFR technologies are not commercially viable today . DEFRs will require committed public and private investment in research and development efforts to identify the most efficient and cost-effective technologies with a view towards the development and eventual adoption of commercially viable resources . The development and construction lead times necessary for these technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ • As the energy policies in neighboring regions evolve , New York ’ s imports and exports of energy could vary significantly due to the resulting changes in neighboring grids . New York is fortunate to have strong interconnections with neighboring regions and has enjoyed reliability and economic benefits from such connections . The availability of energy for interchange is predicted to shift fundamentally as policy achievement progresses . Balancing the need to serve demand reliably while achieving New York ’ s emission-free target will require continuous monitoring and collaboration with our neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report led to the following recommendations : • Future uncertainty is the only thing certain about the electric power industry . From policy advancements to new dispatchable emissions-free resource technology innovation and ultimate development , the system is set to change at a rapid pace . Situational awareness of system changes and continuous assessment are critical to ensure a reliable and lower-emissions grid for New York . The Economic Planning databases and models will be continually updated with new information and the Outlook study will be improved and performed on a biennial basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement in 2040 , at least 95 GW of new emission-free resources , including approximately 9.5 GW of new renewable resources , will be required to come on-line . Furthermore , to fully achieve the emission-free grid target by 2040 , even more resources will likely be needed along with transmission to deliver the clean power to consumers . The scope of the additional renewable resource need is both substantial and unprecedented . Compared to the 2.6 GW capacity entering service in the past five years while New York experienced a net loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate in the next 20 years must increase significantly to achieve state law climate change requirements . State agencies should consider releasing a more detailed procurement schedule for renewable resources to guide the long-term system planning and provide clarity to the market . I noted earlier that I was comfortable saying that the major findings in this draft report will not change substantively when it is finalized . I base that mostly on the fact that the NYISO Market Marketing Unit has reviewed the draft . As part of their market monitoring responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York ’ s de-regulated electric markets . If you are interested in that particular aspect of electric system planning , I suggest checking out the memo . For the rest of us , I only note that they state : “ The 2021 Outlook is a major improvement to NYISO ’ s previous planning studies and provides important insights on the potential impacts of state policies on the NYISO system. ” More importantly , what about the Climate Action Council ? Unfortunately , as I pointed out before the Climate Action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by New York agencies responsible for keeping the lights on . In a series of meetings over the next couple of months the Council will have to address the Draft Scoping Plan comments made by the NYISO and the New York State Reliability Council that raised reliability concerns . I hope . without any supporting evidence , that the Integration Analysis team is working with the NYISO planning staff to reconcile the differences between this analysis and theirs . In the meantime , there are vocal members of the Climate Action Council that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with a renewable energy resource dependent electric system . At the May 26 , 2022 Climate Action Council meeting Council members described their impressions of comments made at the public hearings . I have prepared an overview summary of all the comments made during the Update on Public Hearings and Comments agenda item and wrote an article highlighting relevant comments . In this regard , Paul Shepson Dean , School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University talked about mis-representation at 23:39 of the recording : Robert Howarth , Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( starting at 32:52 of the recording ) picked up on that theme . He said that fear and confusion is based on mis-information but we have information to counter that and help ease the fears . He stated that he thought reliability is one of those issues : “ Clearly one can run a 100 % renewable grid with reliability ” . Obviously , these views are at odds with this report . There is one other point . In addition to the reliability concerns of the net-zero transition I am very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan has avoided any mention of ratepayer impacts to date . The NYISO projection methodology can has that information because it is inherent in the models It is a shame that it is not being reported . This is an important report for New York but I also believe that there are ramifications for other net zero transition programs . These findings must be reconciled with the Draft Scoping Plan projections for the future generating system . The leadership of the Climate Action has repeatedly punted the responsibility for a feasibility study down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . This report highlights multiple feasibility concerns that must be addressed to have any hope of this working . I believe that it shows that implementation on the schedule proposed will prove impossible . The report also highlights the need for implementation planning . Currently there is no plan for siting renewable resources where they are needed for the future system and this shows that it must be done . With respect to other net-zero transition programs I think the discussion and implications of the dispatchable emissions-free resource are of interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimize the storage and renewable over-build requirements this resource could be a better choice . However , the report notes that DEFRs such as hydrogen , renewable natural gas , and small modular nuclear reactors are not commercially viable today . “ DEFRs will require committed public and private investment in research and development efforts to identify the most efficient and cost-effective technologies with a view towards the development and eventual adoption of commercially viable resources. ” There is that nasty planning and feasibility is necessary component again .

""""""" Architect behind Googleplex now says it 's 'dangerous ' to work at such a posh office For more than three decades , Clive Wilkinson has been among the most sought-after office designers in the world . He has planned spaces for the likes of Microsoft , Disney , Intuit and other companies seeking unorthodox approaches to work life . But he now has regrets about what is perhaps his most famous work : Googleplex , the tech giant 's posh headquarters in Mountain View , Calif. Wilkinson helped lay out Google 's campus after winning its design competition in 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin . `` Larry and Sergey said at the time , 'We do n't really have any reference point but the Stanford campus model , ' `` said Wilkinson . In Mountain View , what emerged was a maze of well-lit nooks , bleachers and clubhouse rooms to encourage collaboration . The office would also become famous for its amenities : Gourmet meals . Fitness classes . Organic gardens . Massage rooms . Laundry services . Private parks . Volleyball courts . Swimming pools . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks Google 's luxurious on-site perks have made workers too dependent on the company , a situation he calls `` dangerous . '' `` This notion that you can provide everything that would support a worker 's life on campus might appear to be extremely generous and supportive , '' he said . `` But it also has a whole range of potentially negative impacts . '' Wilkinson spoke in an interview at his glass-enclosed hillside home in West Los Angeles , which some have compared to a `` spaceship on stilts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came during an extensive conversation with NPR about how the pandemic may forever reshape office life and what it could mean for workers . While Silicon Valley has long been known for offering unusual amenities to its workers , Google 's offerings set a high bar . Other tech giants began to roll out their own free meals , nature trails and private transportation services in efforts to attract and retain talent . But Wilkinson said as companies plan to bring workers back into the office , such arrangements should be reconsidered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and non-work keeps employees tethered to the office , benefiting the employer most of all . That , he argues , may seem to keep workers happy but can quickly spark burnout . `` Work-life balance can not be achieved by spending all your life on a work campus . It 's not real . It 's not really engaging with the world in the way most people do , '' he said . `` It also drains the immediate neighborhoods of being able to have a commercial reality . '' Employees have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local cafes , restaurants or grocery stores because everything is handed to them . To Wilkinson , overly coddling workers like this is `` fundamentally unhealthy . '' That , he said , `` has n't been recognized as one of the dangerous side effects . '' If an employer is trying to foster creativity , `` you do n't want an overly comfortable workplace . You should n't have sleep pods everywhere , '' he said . `` Creative work does n't happen in a condition of luxury . If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall asleep . '' At the same time , it is `` a difficult one to pull apart , '' he said . `` Because once you made all those offers to your employees , how do you pull back from that situation ? '' Authors Charlie Warzel and Anne Helen Petersen talked to Wilkinson about his new perspective on Googleplex in their new book Out of Office : The Big Problem and Bigger Promise of Working from Home . `` There 's a way that something that was built with good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warzel told NPR . `` It 's not a terrible thing for employees to get nice perks , but what is it in service of ? Making you a better worker ? Or making sure your needs are met ? Or keeping you stuck in this liminal work-like state for as long as possible . '' That said , plenty of Google 's some 144,000 employees appear to be just fine with the on-site luxuries their employer provides . Surveys routinely place Google at the top of lists for worker happiness and satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the pandemic forced Googlers off campus , it appears it dented worker morale , and the company is responding with new cash bonuses . Google , which did not respond to a request for comment , is planning a new multi-billion-dollar campus in San Jose and another massive site in Mountain View . The office is not dead , Wilkinson argues When COVID-19 hit , some 2.5 million square feet of office space Wilkinson 's firm was working on was canceled or delayed . But he becomes defiant when asked whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's ridiculous to say the office is dead , '' said Wilkinson , `` The office is the fermenting ground for people growing into successful adults . How would that ever be dead ? '' Studies suggest remote work will outlast the pandemic . But most companies in a new U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey said they also plan to maintain their office spaces . Wilkinson 's corporate clients are now returning . He says most of them are not ready to forgo the office . They are , however , eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense in a hybrid work environment . To a certain degree , he said , companies are winging it . `` People do n't know how much space they need anymore , so I think an awful lot of large companies are waiting to see what everybody else does , '' Wilkinson said . No one wants a depressingly empty office , something he calls `` one of the biggest problems in the new workplace . '' He adds : `` When you go in there , specifically because of hybrid working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's underpowered and it 's running on empty ? '' And so he suspects , happily , that the pandemic has wiped out one particular type of office : the cubicle farm . `` Cubicles are like human chicken farming . They have always been bad for anything other than kind of factory farming kind of approach to the office , '' he said . `` Put people in tiny little footprint because it takes less money than an enclosed office and we can kind of keep an eye on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the 'boutique hotel ' feel If jammed-together desks are out and Wilkinson cautions against swanky amenities à la Google , what does the post-pandemic workplace resemble ? Wilkinson envisions big , open spaces with couches and cozy nooks as work stations that are not assigned to any single employee . An environment where it 's easy to hang out and chat . `` You might think you 're walking into the lounge of a boutique hotel , '' Wilkinson said . `` It 's an amazingly effective work environment , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office furnishing or anything like that . '' He has noticed something else about the pandemic-era office plans he is now working on : companies are investing in outdoor spaces . Go ahead , answer your emails in the shade . `` Because now it 's seen as being healthy , '' he said . `` Health itself has suddenly become one of the top criteria about where you work . '' He said the future office will be a balancing act . It needs to be more attractive than working from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to go home . But not even the most seasoned corporate architect can predict the answer to the question at the center of it all : How many workers really want to return to the office , and how often do they want to be there ? `` We 're having very interesting conversations with a lot of clients right now about , 'Does the office need to be a bunch of project rooms ?

""""""" SANTA ROSA , Calif. ( AP ) — Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is working on an ambitious project to bury thousands of miles of power lines in an effort to prevent igniting fires with its equipment and avoid shutting down electricity during hot and windy weather . PG & E announced last year that it planned to bury 10,000 miles ( 16,000 kilometers ) of power lines in the next decade at a projected cost of $ 15 billion to $ 30 billion .

In 2019 , PG & E filed for bankruptcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fines and lawsuits . In addition to preventing wildfires , PG & E says burying power lines underground will lead to fewer disruptive public safety power shutoffs , which have become more frequent in the last few years due to dry weather and high wind events linked to climate change .

"On Saturday morning in southern Israel, Hamas murdered hundreds of people at a music festival and kidnapped others at gunpoint to serve as human shields in Gaza. On Sunday afternoon in Midtown Manhattan, a speaker at a rally of pro-Palestinian and left-wing groups celebrated that atrocity — one of thousands suffered by Israelis over the past few days, which we later learned included the killing of babies and toddlers. “As you might have seen, there was some sort of rave or desert party where they were having a great time, until the resistance came in electrified hang gliders and took at least several dozen hipsters,” a speaker said. “But I’m sure they’re doing very fine despite what The New York Post says.” He was met with cheers. I went to see the rally for myself: Would there be even perfunctory condemnation of Hamas’s methods? A brief nod of sympathy to Israel’s anguish? Some banal nod to the cause of peace and nonviolence?

"Earlier this month, Chile commemorated 50 years of the military coup that overthrew Salvador Allende’s socialist regime. Left-wing leaders from all over Latin America were invited by President Gabriel Boric to attend a ceremony honoring Allende and condemning General Augusto Pinochet, who took over power on September 11th, 1973. But the event was nothing more than an act of political propaganda, showing the Left’s ideological dogmatism and complete lack of acknowledgement of its own responsibility in the destruction of Chilean democracy a half-century ago. From its inception, the Allende administration—a coalition of radical leftist parties known as “Unidad Popular” (Popular Unity)—strove to transform Chile into a satellite of the Soviet Union. Allende himself had been an informant of the KGB since the 1960s and Soviet funding was crucial for his victory in the 1970 presidential race. Thus, as soon as he took office, Allende began a ruthless transition to a centrally planned economy.",1

If an election were held today, all signs point to a Conservative win and the end of the Trudeau government.

"Illustration: by Tim Bouckley In late June, dozens of conservatives gathered on Capitol Hill for a forum on the failings of American capitalism. The event’s aesthetics were stereotypically Republican. There were the buttoned-up, apple-cheeked postgrads who’ve been staffing GOP Senate offices from time immemorial — the kind of young people whose bow ties tell you they have strong feelings about tax policy, birth rates, and Robert Bork. There were gray-haired Republican donors in dark blazers and prim dresses and a wide assortment of predominantly white middle-aged wonks, all mingling beneath the marble columns and chandeliers of the Russell Senate Office Building’s Kennedy Caucus Room. While the forum’s crowd wouldn’t have looked out of place at a 1980s country club, its speakers’ words would have sounded alien to Republicans of that era. This was not an accident. American Compass, the think tank that had organized the gathering, aims to rip the GOP from Reaganism’s cold, dead hands.",0

ABC News spoke with voters about why they see it as a major issue. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's alarming health episode this week has just added to a debate over age already dominating the campaign trail. Although it's not clear why 81-year-old McConnell appeared to freeze during a news conference -- it nevertheless prompted both candidates and voters to again ask: How old is too old to serve as an elected official -- let alone to serve in the White House?,0
"“[T]he Supreme Court . . . [will] have a right, independent of the legislature, to give a construction to the Constitution and every part of it, and there is no power provided in this system to correct their construction . . . . Men placed in this situation will generally soon feel themselves independent of heaven itself.” (Brutus, Anti-Federalist Papers, 1788). Is the United States Supreme Court above the law? In the aftermath of the court’s 2022-2023 term, the age-old question has arisen with renewed urgency. And it’s not just the court’s many liberal and progressive critics who think the nation’s most powerful judicial body has assumed nearly imperial powers that place it beyond any meaningful accountability. Ironically, Justice Samuel Alito appears to see the court in a similar light, albeit from a decidedly different perspective. In a July interview with The Wall Street Journal, Alito said the not-so-quiet part out loud, remarking, “Congress did not create the Supreme Court”; the Constitution did. “I know this is a controversial view, but I’m willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.”",0

""""""" How ESG investing got tangled up in America 's culture wars A growing number of Republican politicians are moving to penalize Wall Street investors who consider environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) issues when they decide where to put clients ' money . In Florida , a state board chaired by Gov . Ron DeSantis recently barred investment fund managers and advisors from considering `` social , political , or ideological interests '' when making decisions for Florida 's retirement system . In Texas and West Virginia , GOP leaders say they will block investors from state business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossil fuel industry . Fifteen other states are considering similar measures . And Republicans have said that if they retake Congress in the midterms , they plan to push federal legislation to curtail investment decisions they attack as `` woke . '' Anti-ESG Republicans say big financial firms are abusing their power to advance a liberal agenda on issues like diversity , social justice and , especially , climate change . Many experts disagree , saying Republicans are distorting the goals and strategies of ESG investing . It 's hard for most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESG is amid the overheated rhetoric . Is the idea to bring about social changes that could n't be achieved at the ballot box ? And what does it mean for things like your 401K when investors follow ESG principles ? This FAQ is for anyone who wants to better understand an investing trend that is becoming core to global financial markets and a new battlefront in American politics — including , possibly , in your own state . It 's probably easiest to think of this as a set of considerations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks and opportunities that are n't accounted for in traditional financial models . Climate change is one of the simplest examples : Investors are trying to find out how physical risks from things like rising sea levels and worsening drought could impact a company 's operations . For example , does a company rely on water to operate its factories , or to move goods in places like Europe or China where rivers have dried to a trickle this summer ? Investors also want information about `` transition risk '' — how companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at cutting emissions and demand grows for things like renewable energy and batteries . `` It 's about looking at a business and saying , 'Are they prepared for the climate transition that 's coming ? ' '' says Witold Henisz , faculty director of the ESG Initiative at The Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania . `` Some companies are , and some companies are n't . And that tilts your portfolio , it shifts your investment strategy . '' ESG is different from impact investing , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in companies that are trying to achieve certain social or environmental outcomes . `` In our view , ESG is more of a sort of defensive framework , '' says Kunal Shah , a managing director at iCapital , a financial technology company . `` Whereas impact investing ... is focused on investing in companies with a clear mission to make a change to the positive . '' It does n't look that way . Big banks continue to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in financing to the fossil fuel industry every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest asset manager and a favorite target of anti-ESG Republicans , is one of the top shareholders in many leading oil and gas companies . `` ESG is n't about a boycott , '' says Henisz of the Wharton School . `` It 's a question of which fossil fuel company do you hold ? And how long do you hold them ? '' In fact , BlackRock 's CEO , Larry Fink , has said he thinks selling off fossil fuel stocks — or divestment — is an ineffective way to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated for engagement , urging shareholders to press fossil fuel executives to be transparent about their plans for the future . That said , it has gotten more expensive for fossil fuel companies to borrow money in recent years , reflecting the risks those companies face from climate change , says Tensie Whelan , director of New York University 's Stern Center for Sustainable Business . `` It 's not so much that [ lenders are ] punishing the companies . They 're just saying , 'Hey , there 's risk . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , we need to financially assess those risks and build them into the cost of credit , ' '' Whalen says . Is ESG hurting the financial performance of companies or investors ? It does n't appear to be . NYU 's Whalen co-authored a report examining the relationship between ESG and financial performance . After reviewing more than 1,000 research papers published between 2015 and 2020 , Whalen 's team found that corporate sustainability initiatives often seemed to drive better financial performance . They also found that in many cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar or better financial results compared to conventional approaches . That does n't mean proponents of ESG investing think it 's being done perfectly . ESG disclosures vary from company to company . Ratings agencies that assess the data use proprietary methods , making it hard for investors to know how firms reach their conclusions . And there is growing concern that some asset managers are slapping ESG labels on funds that do n't deserve them . `` The problem is we do n't have good data , '' says Henisz of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle to measure whether companies are delivering . '' Why is ESG becoming a political fight now ? Observers point to two potential factors , which are n't mutually exclusive . One is that ESG — and climate considerations more broadly — are becoming ingrained deeply enough in corporate America and financial markets to begin changing the way some industries operate , says Mindy Lubber , CEO of Ceres , a sustainability nonprofit . Hundreds of companies and investment firms , for example , have now promised to eliminate or offset their greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , there were hardly any . The other explanation is that Republicans are trying to score political points ahead of elections . `` Taking climate risk as investment risk is just good business , '' says Henisz of the Wharton School . `` Now , we can argue about how we do it and who does it well and who does it poorly . That 's a legitimate argument . [ But ] the idea that ESG is ideological and not economics is a political argument . '' """"""",0

"Unlike many of us who spew our opinions weekly (and in some cases, weakly), I watch all forms of news from the left-wing news of NBC to the far left-wing news of CNN and PMS-NBC. This gives one perspective and balance. In doing so, I noticed in the last year the theme of national newscasts like NBC is to point out the weather around the United States. They often open with how hot it is in one town or another, as if it has never been hot there before in August. Words like “extreme” and “unprecedented” are used in the newscasts, clearly to advance their “climate change” agenda. Note to media: It is always hot in August. If you hear the newscaster say “hottest ever” in that state, do what I do: look it up. It always turns out that 1925 or 1932 was the hottest year on record.

"Donald Trump’s legal woes, combined with the passionate devotion of his loyalists, have made him one of the biggest wild cards in the history of presidential politics. But this Republican primary cycle has also been shaken up by one of Trump’s self-proclaimed biggest fans, Vivek Ramaswamy. The right-wing entrepreneur, who has said he’s prepared to spend more than $100 million of his own money on his bid and has made ending affirmative action and limiting U.S. military support for Ukraine centerpieces of his campaign, has emerged as enough of a contender that he was on the receiving end of the majority of attacks in the first GOP presidential debate (the one Trump skipped).

""""""" These truly eco friendly vegan leather alternatives should make the naysayers abolish animal leather forever ! I must confess : here at Eluxe , we were horrified to learn that some of the bags and shoes we thought were eco-friendly due to their ‘ vegan ’ credentials , were actually the worst kind of greenwashing : petroleum-based , heavily polluting and toxic . Vegan accessories promoted by the likes of apparently ‘ eco friendly ’ Stella McCartney and Vivienne Westwood were actually no better for the environment than a pair of plastic flip flops from Walmart . Depressing ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegan leathers , and now we simply can ’ t promote them enough – and guess what ? Some of the world ’ s most prestigious fashion brands are already using them , and these materials are in greater and greater demand . These vegan leather alternatives are creative , durable , and beautiful . Curious to see what they are ? Keep reading ! The first eco friendly vegan leather on our list may surprise you : it ’ s paper . While it may be hard to believe that paper can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t forget that we have featured an actual cathedral made from cardboard before . So if you can build architecture with it , it can certainly be strong enough for a handbag ! Bottega Veneta realised this when it created their gorgeous paper Carta Giapponese bag , which you can see below . This elegant clutch is made of tightly woven , a delicate paper derived from the bark of the fast-growing kozo tree ( a Japanese relative of the common mulberry ) . Once made , the is cut , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other designers , such as Doshi , Paper Handbags by Ilvy Jacobs and Engage Green have also made incredible use of paper in their designs . Long used as a water-resistant , organic material in floor tiling , cork is widely regarded as being one of the most ecologically friendly materials around . It ’ s easily recycled , completely natural , and sourcing from cork oak forests for various industries helps prevent desertification and deforestation . Mainly harvested from Southern Europe , there is a particular cork forest in the Iberian Peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangered species in the region . And shopping cork bags can really help with that ! With its naturally waterproof qualities and organic texture , no wonder it has been used by large brands like Chanel and Louboutin , as well as smaller , more eco-friendly ones , too . Some rubber , such as that used in inner tubes , can actually have quite a leathery texture and density , making it the perfect eco friendly vegan leather for fashion accessories . Paguro , for example , is one brand that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easy-to-care for material . The recycled rubber they use imitates the look of fine grain , matte leather , which translates beautifully into their various accessory designs . Laura Zabo is another designer using the stuff . She ’ s replaced leather for upcycled inner tubes in everything from belts and shoes to guitar straps . Waxed cotton , preferably organic , is a perfect substitute for leather . Big brands , such as 7 for all Mankind and Marc Jacobs have long used this for jeans and bags , respectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unlike leather , it ’ s easily washable , cutting down on specialist textile cleaning bills , and also saving the environment from more dry cleaning chemicals . Similar to cork but made from sustainable timber , wood leather is durable , strong and one piece is never like another , due to the varied natural grains of the product . It can even be made as fine and thin as real leather , to create coats and trousers . The best tree bark leather is made from fast growing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-toxic chemicals to make it durable , well preserved and flexible enough to sew . Dolce and Gabbana used this material ( in the form of Flesswood ) to amazing effect in their bags and platform shoes as seen in their catwalk collection last year . When the apple falls from the tree , I bet you didn ’ t expect it to be turned into a leather bag ? By now we ’ re used to some fruit based materials such as orange peels and banana skins being fashioned into clothing textiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new form of eco friendly vegan leather , and we ’ re super thrilled that that apple waste can make a textile that is so incredibly chic , whilst being cruelty free . Wondering where you can buy luxurious vegan accessories made from apple leather ? It ’ s easier than you ’ d think ! Happy Genie makes chic handbags ( below ) , as does Veggani ( second pic , below ) , which is a super-sustainable brand because they also use recycled plastic bottles for the lining of their backpacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from wasted parts of the pineapple bush , and is 100 % vegan friendly and is also ethical in the sense that it gives pineapple farmers yet another source of income from their crops . The fabric feels like thick cowhide leather , is watertight and very durable . No wonder more and more shoe and bag brands are using it ! In fact , H & M recently created a bunch of cowboy boots from the stuff , which you can see in the second image in this article , above . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly vegan leather comes from mushrooms . You can actually grow this mushroom leather to the size and shape you need for any given design . How cool is that ? It needs to be waterproofed , but this can be done in a simple , non-chemical way , making MuSkin completely biodegradable and eco-friendly . Who wouldn ’ t love to have a bag made from this vegan alternative to leather ? Artisans of Sri Lanka are using the thick leaves that grow from the sustainable hana plant and using these to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegan leather . The hana plant produces a fine fibre that ’ s then woven into accessories that are normally made of leather , like wallets , handbags and computer cases . Kantala products is one brand that uses the material gorgeously – and not only that , but all their products are coloured using all natural dyes , too ! Bark and Leaf is a brand that transforms natural , raw materials into urban everyday items made from from banana , rain tree and lotus leaves . These leather-like materials are incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you can take these gorgeous bags , wallets and other vegan friendly accessories along with you anywhere you go , from shopping sprees to impromptu trips to the beach . I think it ’ s fair to say we ’ re all aware of the environmental impact single use plastic is having on our planet . So we were super grateful to hear about REMEANT vegan leather alternatives . While many recycled plastic vegan bag brands use PET bottles to make their accessories , REMEANT is different . They actually use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backyard to make their innovative textiles . Think : plastic bags , plastic cutlery , and hotel shower caps . Available in a range of colours , shades and textures , REMEANT is a highly durable textile that is also water-resistant , making it the perfect fabric for hard-wearing handbags , home textiles , and clothing . What feels a bit like cork and suede had a baby , and smells like a freshly made latte ? It ’ s coffee leather , of course ! Nat2 is one brand that is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are in high demand . And no wonder : just look at that natural brown hue , and all the different textures coffee leather can achieve ! I can ’ t wait until they start making handbags from this eco friendly vegan leather ! What ’ s the only thing that may smell better than coffee leather ? Wine leather , of course ! Vegea Company is already producing another kind of eco friendly vegan leather from winemaking by-products like grape peels and seeds . If course , it comes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bordeaux , burgundy and so on . I love the fact that it can be printed to look like any kind of animal skin you like , from ostrich and cow to snake . But the best part ? This material will soon be available on a mass scale ! In fact , H & M is making a bunch of gorgeous vegans handbags and shoes from the stuff , in partnership with Vegea . The eco-friendly collections will also feature a new dye made from coffee grounds . Also known as nopal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegan leather is made from the sun-dried fibres of cactus plants in Mexico . It ’ s durable , smooth and water-resistant . You can use it to make anything from belts and bags to coats and shoes . Just check out these sneakers by Clae , below , for example . What ’ s not to love ? Nettles are a kind of ‘ love it or hate it ’ plant . As a gardener , I find them to be quite annoying . They grow like weeds ( because , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season .

This sounds like a story I ’ ve written almost once a week since the beginning of the new year and it ’ s happening all over the country .

According to the Associated Press , a ruling from U.S. District Judge Catherine Blake said bodycam footage of the incident does not contradict the family ’ s claims that officers used excessive force on Black , adding a jury “ could reach more than one conclusion ” on whether officers used excessive force or not .

As a result of Black ’ s death , lawmakers in Maryland passed a bill named after him to bolster public access to records about police disciplinary cases . More on the details of Black ’ s death from the Associated Press : An autopsy report on Black ’ s death was released in 2019 two days after Maryland Gov .

But an expert for the lawsuit ’ s plaintiffs , a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins University , concluded that asphyxiation was the cause of Black ’ s death .

A medical examiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Floyd died from asphyxiation , according to USA Today . Judge Blake stated that former Greensboro police Officer Thomas Webster , the one making the arrest , was reasonable for trying to arrest and chase after Black because he suspected he was assaulting a 12-year-old boy , according to the Associated Press .

"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., current presidential candidate and nephew of former Democratic President John F. Kennedy has chosen to run as an independent instead of with the Democratic party. This decision will affect each party and may give him a better chance in the election, but his chance of actually winning the presidency is slim. Independent candidates in U.S. elections generally don’t receive a large percentage of the vote; the traditional two-party system prevents third-party candidates from gaining ground in the elections and favors Democrat and Republican candidates. With this tradition in mind, it’s likely Kennedy will not be able to secure the presidency running independently. Originally a Democrat following in his father Robert F.

""""""" Like every unhappy family , every political scandal is different . But the assassination attempt that targeted Nancy Pelosi and gravely injured her husband , Paul , offers some grim points of reflection for students of recent Republican politics . These lessons stand out in especially high relief when you cast your mind back to the last midterm cycle that brought an October surprise to the GOP faithful : the 2006 scandal involving Florida Representative Mark Foley , who sent a string of sexual e-mails and texts to adolescent boys who were working as pages for the House . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandals are distinct . Foley was an elected official and a closeted gay Republican , and the story broke two years after the GOP had demagogued the issue of gay marriage to help reelect George W. Bush . Paul Pelosi ’ s attacker , David DePape , is a right-wing conspiratorialist who told the San Francisco Police Department that he intended to wrest “ the truth ” from Nancy Pelosi by threatening to break her kneecaps . Still , each incident should have prompted a crisis of conscience for a political party interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the GOP ’ s response when the Foley bombshell dropped in early October 2006 was far from exemplary : Then–House Speaker Dennis Hastert tried to coordinate messaging among party leaders who should have testified independently before a pending ethics committee investigation .

Foley resigned , at the leadership ’ s prompting , just prior to the 2006 balloting , and a Democratic challenger took his historically safe GOP seat . And Republican leaders realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences : While the incumbent GOP majority in Congress was already endangered by the disastrous course of the war in Iraq and the corruption of the Bush White House , the Foley scandal rendered a Democratic takeover of Congress a virtual certainty . “ I was working on a congressional campaign back then , ” says Timothy Miller , the communications director for Jeb Bush ’ s 2016 presidential campaign . “ I always felt we lost that race because of Mark Foley—we had a narrow lead , and it broke the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About the Economy The Pelosi Attack Marks an Age of Political Violence To say that none of the restraints that Republican leaders felt circa 2006 apply to the Trump-era GOP is a cosmic understatement . In the main , party leaders and influencers responded to DePape ’ s horrific attack not by straightforwardly addressing the epidemic of political violence on the right but through broad-stroke denunciations of it , which they , as usual , attributed as much to Democrats as to their own election-denying , apocalypse-minded base . Right-wingers rushed to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime policies—and in the wake of the news that DePape is a Canadian national who overstayed his visa , launched into full anti-immigrant mode . In other words , in this instance as in so many others , the party is acting just as Donald Trump would . Thus it was fitting that Donald Trump Jr. stormed through Twitter blasting out any and all available conspiracy theories , vicious memes , and right-wing talking points relating to the attack . It ’ s hard to isolate a low point on Trump Jr. ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pair of underpants and a hammer , tagged as Paul Pelosi ’ s Halloween costume , was right down there ; it was a reference to an early conspiracy theory that DePape was Paul Pelosi ’ s lover . A big factor in the Foley scandal ’ s reception on the right was the press—the St. Petersburg Times had been reporting an investigation on Foley ’ s conduct for the better part of a year before ABC News ran its own report . GOP leaders knew that if they stonewalled or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come across as moral cowards and enablers . But the Trump playbook has rendered such concerns a dead letter on the right . After years of GOP-sanctioned assaults on “ fake news ” purveyors as “ enemies of the people , ” the party feels no compunction about spreading lies and throwing conspiracy theories against the wall to see if they ’ ll stick with its base . The right has indeed built its own media ecosystem dedicated to just these aims . “ The more-or-less fascist Tucker Carlson of 2022 makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned , courtly conservative , ” says William Kristol , who was Carlson ’ s boss when he edited the conservative Weekly Standard . The GOP has never looked back after the Trump campaign ’ s belligerent handling of the 2016 Access Hollywood scandal , Miller notes , when the presidential nominee was caught on tape bragging about past sexual assaults . In prior moments of scandal , “ the old Republican guard made the call that the best thing for the overall brand of the party was to distance yourself from scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . “ Now the conventional wisdom among Republican candidates and strategists is to just mock the opposition. ” Amid these near-hermetic conditions of ideological insulation , it ’ s no great surprise that Foley himself has wandered back into the Republican mainstream as a prominent Trump supporter .

How much diplomatic support will Beijing provide , and what does it say about China ’ s willingness to embark on missions of its own ? As the invasion accelerated this week , scholars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new contours in global power .

By some standards , Russia and China are not natural geopolitical partners . China ’ s mistrust of Russia runs deep . Even in the heyday of Communist brotherhood , the two sides had long-standing territorial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position as the junior partner to Moscow . These days , Russia ’ s economy , valued at $ 1.7 trillion , is scarcely larger than that of New York State . China , by contrast , has the largest or the second-largest G.D.P . in the world , depending on how it ’ s measured , and , despite stresses on its trade relations , the nation has productive trade links with the United States and Europe that dwarf Russia ’ s oil-and-gas sales . But the Russian and Chinese leaders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that the West is in an inexorable decline , which they have framed , in effect , as a vindication of autocracy .

Most importantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategic significance of Sino-Russian relations. ” That “ strategic significance ” is the key ; their combined power is greater than the sum of its parts , or so the theory goes . And yet , for all the chumminess , the decision to draw close to Putin has forced Xi into an awkward balancing act , because he hopes to establish China as a trusted steward of global power and security—an alternative to the chaos and infighting in Washington . Ukraine is one of China ’ s economic partners , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade flows . It is also part of the Belt and Road Initiative , Xi ’ s signature infrastructural program , which is intended to project a spirit of magnanimous investment in the world ’ s improvement .

"Steve Scalise On Wednesday, House Republicans gave themselves a half-victory when they nominated Majority Leader Steve Scalise to be speaker. This came after a standoff between Scalise, the number two in the House Republican conference who is a well-liked figure, and Rep Jim Jordan (R-OH), a right-wing firebrand and co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus. Former president Donald Trump had endorsed Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who played a key role in Trump’s attempts to oveturn the 2020 election.This does not necessarily translate to Scalise getting the gavel. Remember, that requires a majority of the House as a whole; not just a majority of the party. And given that Republicans have only 221 seats in a 435-seat House of Representatives with two vacancies, that means any nominee for speaker can only afford to lose four votes. Indeed, Rep Ken Buck (R-CO), another member of the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters that he grilled Jordan and Scalise about who actually won the 2020 presidential election. And in frustration, he said he voted “present.” (Buck, for those who forget, was one of the eight Republicans who voted to boot Kevin McCarthy).But beyond the current fight, there is one question nobody is asking: Why in God’s name would any rational Republican member of Congress take the job? Any study of the most recent Republican speakers shows the job requires making promises that are impossible to keep and inevitably infuriating enough of the conference that you leave in disgrace. It’s important to remember that Democrats controlled the House of Representatives for the majority of the 20th century. Indeed, from 1955 to 1995, Democrats never lost control of the majority until the 1994 midterms when Newt Gingrich led the Republican Revolution. But Gingrich left office in disgrace. Many people remember how he had an extramarital affair all while he ravenously pursued an impeachment trial of Bill Clinton. But his downfall actually came before then, when after the fallout from the Clinton impeachment, Republicans actually lost House seats in the 1998 midterm election. Before that, the House had lurched from crisis to crisis, including two government shutdowns.Afterward, Republicans picked Bob Livingston before reports emerged that he had engaged in an extramarital affair, which led to Dennis Hastert taking the top job. Hastert would serve from 1999 to 2007, when Democrats took control of the House for the first time in more than a decade. In 2010, Republicans rode the Tea Party wave that largely came in response to anger during Barack Obama’s first term. In turn, John Boehner would take the gavel. He lasted a respectable five years, but the most right-wing voices in his conference — among them, Jordan — often pressured him, making it nearly impossible for him to negotiate with the White House. In 2013, a handful of conservatives and Sen Ted Cruz (R-TX) shut down the government in an attempt to defund Obamacare, something that never would have happened given Democratic control of the Senate.Eventually, Mark Meadows, the future chief of staff to Trump but then a congressman from North Carolina, filed a motion to vacate. While a vote never happened, it was enough to push Boehner over the limit. After bringing Pope Francis to address Congress, Boehner called it a day and resigned. These days, he mostly spends his days lobbying for legal marijuana and posts pictures of himself fishing on social media. That led to McCarthy seeking the speakership before he prematurely dropped out. In a panic, the House coalesced around Paul Ryan, the doe-eyed Ways & Means chairman who often dazzled the Washington press corps with his seeming mastery of economic statistics. But Ryan’s tenure coincided with the rise of Trumpism, which firmly rejected Ryan’s message of free trade, restricting entitlements and supporting immigration reform. Ryan would pass massive tax cuts with Trump and criminal justice reform but the legislation he shepherded to repeal Obamacare died in a spectacularly public fashion when the late John McCain delivered a dramatic 11th-hour thumbs-down vote.Ryan often feigned ignorance about Trump’s worst impulses, telling reporters he hadn’t seen the president’s tweets before he finally called it quits in 2019. Then, of course, there is McCarthy, who tied himself in knots to please every faction of the House GOP conference, and went 15 rounds earlier this year before he got the gavel, only to face the ultimate humiliation of being booted last week.",0

"The 2024 election is promising to be one for the ages, and an underplayed story so far is how the left wing of the Democratic Party has so easily fallen in behind President Joe Biden. Far from challenging Biden, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders has emerged as one of the president’s most vociferous supporters. The Vermont socialist has been hitting the airwaves and hustings to tell progressive voters to back the president. He’s trashed the idea of a third-party run by the Black left-wing professor Cornel West. You might even say Sanders is Biden’s leading surrogate, and no doubt he’s acting with the blessing of the White House. “President Biden and his administration have made some real progress in addressing issues that have not been dealt with in decades,” Sanders said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" He cited drug price controls and public-works projects before pivoting to say Democrats have to do much more to win back the “working class.”",0

"A few years ago, I got what, for a writer of political fiction, is a dream job. I was invited by the estate of George Orwell to write a retelling of Nineteen Eighty-Four from the point of view of Julia, the lover of the protagonist, Winston Smith. The concept had been in the air for years, until its writing seemed inevitable; by asking a trusted person to do it, they hoped to nudge it in a direction that did justice to the original. They wouldn’t pay me, but after I’d finished and published the novel, they would give it their support and help it find its way in the world. It was a huge compliment but also a daunting responsibility, and I was immediately engrossed in work: rereading Nineteen Eighty-Four, sketching plans and ideas, researching the political history that drove Orwell to write his book, drafting my first pages. My opening chapter – like Orwell’s – was the well-known scene of the Two Minutes Hate. The Two Minutes Hate is a ritual in which Party members gather to watch a film of the rebel leader Emmanuel Goldstein and express compulsory rage. Regardless of their beliefs, the audience finds this an easy task. “The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate,” Orwell writes, “was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within 30 seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one’s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.”",0

""""""" Livakovic was Croatia 's penalty-shootout savior against Japan in the quarterfinals , when he saved three spot kicks , and Brazil in the quarterfinals , when he denied Rodrygo . His performance against Brazil stood out as he thwarted the tournament favorite time and again before Neymar 's goal in extra time , and likely put him on the radar of some big clubs in Europe . Livakovic currently plays for Croatian team Dinamo Zagreb . His only mistake was bringing down Julián Álvarez for a penalty converted by Lionel Messi in the 3-0 loss to Argentina in the semifinals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best right back in the world with his performances in Qatar , where he mixed solidity in defense with surging runs in Morocco 's counterattacks to help with its attack . Despite carrying an injury throughout the tournament , he transferred his club form with Paris Saint-Germain to the World Cup and played every game , even helping to largely neutralize his club teammate and friend Kylian Mbappé in the semifinals . Their embrace at the end of the match was a touching moment , while his “ Panenka ” penalty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round of 16 was audacious . Hernandez started the World Cup as backup at left back to his older brother , Lucas , who sustained a tournament-ending ruptured ACL in his right knee just eight minutes into France 's opening game against Australia . Naturally more attacking than his sibling , Theo has filled in impressively and linked up well down the left with Kylian Mbappé , setting up a goal for France 's superstar striker against Denmark and also for Adrien Rabiot against Australia . Hernandez also scored the opening goal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid defensive performances except for a tough night against England winger Bukayo Saka in the quarterfinals . Gvardiol might be best remembered at the World Cup for being turned inside out by Lionel Messi for Argentina 's third goal in the semifinals . Otherwise , he did little wrong , bolstering his reputation as one of the most sought-after center backs in the European game at just age 20 . Known as “ Little Pep ” because of the similarities of his last name with that of Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the World Cup after breaking his nose last month — marshalled a Croatia defense that conceded just three goals in five games before coming up against Messi and Co . He also scored in the third-place playoff . Otamendi is one of two Argentina players — along with Lionel Messi — to play every minute on the road to the final and one of three outfield players to start every game . The leader of Argentina 's rugged defense that has improved throughout the tournament , Otamendi will make his 100th appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final of what will probably be his last World Cup . A memorable sight was Otamendi collapsing on top of Argentina goalkeeper Emi Martinez after his last-minute save against Australia in the round of 16 . Amrabat has been the outstanding defensive midfielder in the tournament , the shield for a Moroccan defense that did n't concede a goal by an opposition player until the semifinals . Not only does he read the game expertly — note his perfectly timed tackle on Kylian Mbappé in the semifinals after chasing back alongside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teammates ' lethal counterattacks with some timely and precision passing . Fiorentina will do well to hold onto the 26-year-old Amrabat , whose specific skillset is always in demand . The 19-year-old Bellingham probably has his pick of any club in Europe after his standout performances in England ’ s run to the quarterfinals . The question now is when , rather than if , Borussia Dortmund sells the midfielder , who can do pretty much anything and has an old head on young shoulders . He scored against Iran , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the round of 16 and drove his team on in its second-half recovery against France in the last eight . Griezmann , who has been a forward throughout his career , has been reinvented as a midfield playmaker at this World Cup and has been a revelation , likely rivalling Messi and Mbappé as the player of the tournament . He created 11 chances during the group stage , more than any other player , then ran the first half of the quarterfinal match against England before being awarded the player of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the semifinals . Not only has he demonstrated his creativity with short and long passes , he has also relished the defensive part of the game , which was needed against Morocco in particular . Mbappé has been France 's most important forward for the second straight World Cup , leading the team to the brink of back-to-back titles at the age of 23 . He scored four goals in France 's run to the trophy in 2018 and has added five in the lead-up to the final four years later , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the round of 16 being the highlights . On that trajectory , Miroslav Klose 's record of 16 career World Cup goals will surely be threatened by Mbappé if he stays healthy . Messi has been a man on a mission since arriving in Qatar , determined to mark likely his final World Cup with the trophy to complete his resume . He has scored five goals , including in every round in the knockout stage up to the final , and added three assists . Messi has also provided some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his dribbles to set up goals for Nahuel Molina against the Netherlands in the quarterfinals and for Julián Álvarez against Croatia in the semifinals . Messi has become Argentina 's all-time top scorer at the World Cup with 11 goals and will make his 26th World Cup appearance — a record — in the final . Álvarez has come from nowhere to become one of Argentina 's most important players , having replaced Lautaro Martinez after his teammate 's poor performances in the opening two games .

"How can we protect free speech in professional environments Can employees resist woke indoctrination in their workplace without being penalised? A series of legal rulings in Britain suggests the answer now is “yes”. This could upend the entire edifice of compulsory critical theory-based diversity training, a hallmark of what Doug Stokes terms the “grievance-industrial complex”. The concept of wokeness seems to sit at the heart of the present turbulence in our social, working and political lives. Even invoking the word “woke” is prone to induce strong, visceral reactions in those who have an interest in the ongoing culture war. We define it as the sacralisation of historically disadvantaged race, gender and sexual minority groups. From this, it follows that anything that can be interpreted as offending a hypothetically sensitive member of such a group, or opposing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies designed to assist such groups, is an offence against the sacred — punishable by cancellation. Woke reinforces a left-wing ideology of cultural socialism, which demands equal results for identity groups as well as the need to protect them from even micro-emotional harms.",0
""""""" Why do fitness device makers claim you need to take 10,000 steps every day ? Do you also really need to drink eight glasses of water daily ? The scientific basis for popular health claims is often thin . A piece in the New York Times , for example , notes that the idea of 10,000 steps was based more on marketing—it was the name of an early pedometer—than science . Data point to clear benefits from moderate exercise—perhaps 7,000 steps or so but not necessarily more . Often popular wisdom turns out to be only sort of true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one instance . Glasses of water is another . If you let yourself get too thirsty , you may be tempted to reach for sodas or sugary coffee drinks , and that 's not good . But a scientific review in 2002 found “ no scientific studies ” that support the eight-glass claim for healthy adults in a temperate climate . That does n't mean it 's wrong , but it does mean we probably should n't worry if we drink only six . It 's worthwhile to dig a bit into often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can sometimes find a nugget of truth that has become seriously exaggerated , or you discover that a claim stems from outdated and poorly applied evidence . The latter is what happened with a famous and specious claim about female fertility . For decades women have heard distressing warnings about their “ biological clocks. ” We have been repeatedly told that fertility drops dramatically after age 30 , so people who want children either need to get moving or else freeze their eggs . Embryo freezing is now a big business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among young professional women . Pregnancy , and age-linked anxiety about it , also occurs among transgender and nonbinary people . But , as Jean M. Twenge reported in 2013 in the Atlantic , the claim is based on very sparse data , much of them of dubious quality or relevance . The notion stems largely from a 2004 paper based on records from 1670 through 1830 . Many things have changed since then , including medical care and nutrition . In wealthier nations , people are now healthier overall and likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives . Systematic data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics demonstrate that from 1980 to 2002 fertility rates for women aged 30 and older were going up . It is also worth noting that when infertility treatments started to become more common and more clinics began opening in the 1980s and 1990s , alarms over biological clocks were being sounded by this growing industry with a self-interest in the matter . Despite the importance of childbearing to so many people—and although infertility treatments are costly , have only modest success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that robust studies of age-dependent infertility are scant . The data we do have tend to show that although fertility does decline slightly at older ages , most women continue to be fertile well into their 30s , and for many people that is a good time to have children . There 's a long-standing cultural tendency to blame infertility on women , but when a couple is infertile it is equally likely that the cause can be traced to the man . Male fertility also declines with age , but how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male biological clock ? * Like the female clock or the 10,000 steps , many health beliefs have shallow and flimsy roots . But sometimes the wisdom of the crowd is supported by facts : most of us do need around eight hours of sleep a night , for instance .

""""""" Frederic Gemus still remembers the first time he played the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game . There was something about the experience , with its big expressive characters and approachable gameplay , that sucked him right in . “ Playing that game was so mind blowing because it was just like playing the cartoon , ” he tells me over Zoom ( with a huge collection of retro games behind him ) . “ It was so different from the Nintendo back in the days. ” So , when Gemus , now a designer at Montreal-based studio Tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a modern take on TMNT , it was pretty much a dream project . “ That was pretty awesome to learn about , ” he says of being put on the project . Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : Shredder ’ s Revenge is out now , and it comes from some proven experts in the field . It ’ s developed by Tribute , which features developers who worked on titles like Scott Pilgrim vs . The World : The Game and the cult hit TMNT game for the Game Boy Advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team behind the incredible revival of Streets of Rage . The goal of Shredder ’ s Revenge was much the same : to take the best parts of the classic TMNT titles and make them work for a modern audience . “ Playing that game was so mind blowing because it was just like playing the cartoon. ” For Gemus , there were a few things that made those classic games stand out , which he wanted to emphasize in Shredder ’ s Revenge . The first was accessibility . While the arcade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of your quarters as possible — and , thus , were quite challenging — they were still easier to pick up and play than many of their contemporaries . He also believes that the pacing and level design of the original TMNT games had much more in common with an action game than a standard side-scrolling beat ‘ em up . “ You have enemies coming in , in different patterns , and it ’ s all about disposing of them very quickly so you don ’ t get swarmed , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that we really wanted to recapture in the game. ” Of course , while the team utilized a similar design philosophy , they were also able to take advantage of modern technology . Shredder ’ s Revenge is available on the PS4 , Switch , Xbox , and Steam , which is a slight step up from 16-bit consoles and ‘ 90s-era arcade cabinets . Crucially , it still looks deliciously retro , with beautiful and expressive pixel art full of all kinds of cool animations . I especially love the Foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguising themselves as chefs before an attack . ( It also sounds the part thanks to a brilliant soundtrack from Sonic Mania composer Tee Lopes . ) “ We like to say that we love to make games the way you remember them , rather than the way they were , ” Gemus says . But the developers weren ’ t as limited when it came to how much they could put on screen and weren ’ t forced to do things like reuse animations or character sprites in the interest of saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add in completely modern features like online play . Striking that balance between modern and retro was a challenge , one that involved plenty of research and testing . The development team played most of the classics — not just TMNT games but other beat ‘ em ups as well — and dug up old issues of Nintendo Power to get a better sense of how the levels were laid out . Testing , meanwhile , was particularly tricky . Initially , it was impossible to have testers play together locally due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were able to , the chaotic nature of the game ’ s multiplayer — which supports up to six players — made following the playthroughs difficult . “ Sometimes it ’ s a bit hard to analyze what ’ s going on because there ’ s so many things happening on screen , ” Gemus says . And while nostalgia is obviously a big part of the experience , both for the classic games and the original animated series , Gemus says Shredder ’ s Revenge was designed so that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ There are no real points in the game where you need to have knowledge of [ the original games ] , ” he says . “ There are a lot of Easter eggs , of course , and little homages . But there ’ s never really any prerequisite to be able to still enjoy the game. ” Shredder ’ s Revenge is coming out at a time when there ’ s something of a resurgence of side-scrolling beat ‘ em ups . It ’ s a particularly great time to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shredder ’ s Revenge , 13 classic games are also getting a bundle later this year . And Gemus has a theory as to why these games , which once dominated arcades , are so enduring . “ At first you feel like it ’ s just button mashing , but then at one point you kind of realize that it ’ s more like a dance , ” he explains . “ There ’ s a lot of positioning , a lot of rhythm — it ’ s like dancing .

"On August 31, 2023, the President of the Communist Party of Chile, Guillermo Teillier, was buried in the historical cemetery of Recoleta. In this graveyard lies the remains of a range of important people, from former Chilean President Salvador Allende to the socialist singer Victor Jara. Both Allende and Jara were victims of the military coup d’état that took place 50 years ago on September 11, 1973. Teillier, who was tortured for several years in prison after the coup, went underground after his release and led the efforts of rebuilding the Communist Party (CP) underground (since it had been banned), its armed wing (El Frente Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez), and the broader popular movement that led to the restoration of democracy in 1990. Chile’s President Gabriel Boric attended the memorial before Teillier’s burial and called for two days of national mourning on August 30 and 31 to mark the loss of Tellier, who he said lived a “dignified life.” At the funeral, the Communist Party’s General Secretary Lautaro Carmona emphasised the importance of Tellier’s leadership—at great personal cost—in the fight against the military dictatorship and in the fight in the past three decades to revive a socialist project in Chile. Despite attempts to bury the legacy of the Left—including the advances made by the Popular Unity government led by Salvador Allende (who served as president from 1970 to 1973), the communists—who are part of Boric’s government—continue to struggle to advance an agenda to establish sovereignty over Chile’s economy and to improve the everyday living conditions of the people of the country.",0

Joining with other revolutionists to found the Communist Party in the United States in 1919, he served on the executive committee of the Communist International in 1922. Expelled from the CP in 1928 for leading the fight to maintain Lenin’s proletarian internationalist course, he was a founding leader of the SWP. Copyright © 1976 by Pathfinder Press. Reprinted by permission. A great contribution Jim made was the key role he played in founding the International Labor Defense in the 1920s. Two of the outstanding cases that were handled by the International Labor Defense under the leadership of Jim Cannon were the Mooney-Billings case and the case of Sacco and Vanzetti. In the ILD there were certain ground rules established. For example, the rule that there be no factionalism in defense. Because what you’re defending — in addition to the individual defendant or defendants — is the democratic rights of the working class and its allies. From this derives that famous labor slogan “An injury to one is an injury to all.”",0

The title of the tour is “Resisting Russian Imperialism: Ukraine’s Struggle for Self-Determination.” The individuals involved are: Ilya Budraitskis and Ilya Matveev, both leading figures of the Pabloite Russian Socialist Movement (RSM) and now based at UC Berkeley; Denys Bondar, a physics professor at Tulane University; and Hanna Perekhoda, who is based at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.

"Perhaps the most effective public official in Donald Trump’s administration was Joe Simons, the man the 45th president tapped as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, the little-noticed antitrust agency. Simons, a young academic whose glittering résumé and Federalist Society membership got him the job, immediately set to work reversing the damage done by swampy Bush- and Obama-era regulators. It was a tall order. The FTC had effectively lay dormant for decades, often focused on bringing antitrust action against the little guy, like ice-skating teachers, church organists and bull-semen traders. These and many other small-time market actors were forced to sign consent decrees in the 2010s after the FTC went after them. But Simons understood the latent power of his agency, which is supposed to police US markets for fair competition. Under his leadership, the FTC emerged as the tip of the spear in Trump’s campaign against the tech giants and foreign multinationals that were ripping off America. “The move was especially popular with the Trump-supporting farmers.”",1

"The real Left is not the caricature crafted by the US Right.

Nor is the real Left what Democratic Party leaders and their foreign counterparts try hard to dismiss as tiny and politically irrelevant (except when electoral campaigns flirt with “progressive” proposals to get votes). The real Left in the United States and beyond are the millions who at least vaguely understand that the whole system (including its mainstream Right and Left) is the core problem. As those millions steadily raise their awareness to an explicit consciousness, they recognise that basic system change is the needed solution. On the one hand, the real Left divides into particular social movements (focused on areas like ecological survival, feminism, anti-racism, labour militancy, and sexual rights). On the other hand, those social movements increasingly understand themselves to comprise components of a new unity they must organise. One key unifying force is anti-capitalism.

You can get the tax deduction today , and there ’ s no requirement for that money ever to get to the community . You can give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it in a tax-free investment account forever. ” Many DAF proponents oppose the changes , arguing that DAFs , with an average payout rate of around 20 % , are distributing money faster and more robustly than many private foundations , whose average distribution is generally only slightly above the 5 % annually required by law , according to the Stanford Law School Policy Lab on Donor Advised Funds .

"Europe and the United States are on the verge of the most momentous conscious uncoupling in international relations in decades. Since 1949, NATO has been the one constant in world security. Initially an alliance among the United States, Canada, and 10 countries in Western Europe, NATO won the Cold War and has since expanded to include almost all of Europe. It has been the single most successful security grouping in modern global history. It also might collapse by 2025. The cause of this collapse would be the profound difference in outlook between the Republican Party’s populist wing—which is led by Donald Trump but now clearly makes up the majority of the GOP—and the existential security concerns of much of Europe. The immediate catalyst for the collapse would be the war in Ukraine. When the dominant faction within one of the two major American political parties can’t see the point in helping a democracy-minded country fight off Russian invaders, that suggests that the center of the political spectrum has shifted in ways that will render the U.S. a less reliable ally to Europe. The latter should prepare accordingly. Read: What America’s great unwinding would mean for the world",0

The white , heavy-duty miner 's pants with a five-button fly were among 270 Gold Rush-era artifacts that sold for a total of nearly $ 1 million in Reno last weekend , according to Holabird Western American Collections .

Some say historical evidence suggests there are links to Strauss , who was a wealthy wholesaler of dry goods at the time , and the pants could be a very early version of what would become the iconic jeans . But the company 's historian and archive director , Tracey Panek , says any claims about their origin are “ speculation. ” “ The pants are not Levi ’ s nor do I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ” she wrote in an email to The Associated Press . Regardless of their origin , there ’ s no denying the pants were made before the S.S. Central America sank in a hurricane on Sept. 12 , 1857 , packed with passengers who began their journey in San Francisco and were on their way to New York via Panama . And there 's no indication older work pants dating to the Gold Rush-era exist . “ Those miner ’ s jeans are like the first flag on the moon , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dwight Manley , managing partner of the California Gold Marketing Group , which owns the artifacts and put them up for auction .

A $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1856 and later stamped with a Sacramento drug store ad brought $ 43,200 . Most of the passengers aboard the S.S. Central America left San Francisco on another ship — the S.S.

He said Panek did n't disagree with him . Levi Strauss & Co. has long maintained that up until 1873 , the company was strictly a wholesaler and did no manufacturing of clothing . Holabird believes the pants were made by a subcontractor for Strauss . He decided to “ follow the money — follow the gold '' and discovered Strauss ' had a market reach and sales “ on a level never seen before. ” “ Strauss was the largest single merchant to ship gold out of California in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Levi Strauss had at least 14 similar shipments averaging $ 91,033 each from 1856-58 , Holabird said . “ Strauss is selling to every decent-sized dry goods store in the California gold regions , probably hundreds of them — from Shasta to Sonora and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This guy was an absolute marketing genius , unforeseen .

Republican lawmakers pushing the Florida legislation argued that parents , not teachers , should be the ones talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early formative years . The legislation attracted scrutiny from Democrats including Biden , who called it “ hateful. ” It has been sent to DeSantis , who is expected to sign it into law . Chapek has apologized for not coming out more forcefully and publicly against the bill , saying Disney officials worked behind the scenes to stop it . Chapek also announced a pause to political donations in Florida and support for advocacy groups fighting similar legislation in other states , reiterating those points during a company-wide discussion Monday . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney employee Nicholas Maldonado was a lone protester Tuesday , wearing a rainbow flag and holding a sign reading , “ Trans rights are human rights ” and “ # DisneyDoBetter. ” “ Where was Chapek when the bill was introduced ? ” said Maldonado , who had a day off from his merchandising job at an Orlando Disney store and , while disappointed with Chapek ’ s initial response , said he felt Disney ’ s leaders were beginning to hear the concerns of the company ’ s workers .

On March 16 , 2016 , Barack Obama nominated him to replace Antonin Scalia .

Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorsuch , who was thereafter confirmed to the Supreme Court . Merrick Garland was appointed as the Attorney General under Joe Biden . He heads the Department of Justice , and has shown repeatedly since then that he has no real understanding of the US Constitution . Just this week alone he has issued two separate press releases that say he and his department will fight two opinions given by the Supreme Court . ( emphasis added ) The first concerned the Second Amendment : “ We respectfully disagree with the Court ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York ’ s reasonable requirement that individuals seeking to carry a concealed handgun must show that they need to do so for self-defense . The Department of Justice remains committed to saving innocent lives by enforcing and defending federal firearms laws , partnering with state , local and tribal authorities and using all legally available tools to tackle the epidemic of gun violence plaguing our communities. ” And , of course , there is the returning of abortion laws to the states : “ Today , the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that the right to abortion is no longer protected by the Constitution . “ The Supreme Court has eliminated an established right that has been an essential component of women ’ s liberty for half a century – a right that has safeguarded women ’ s ability to participate fully and equally in society .

The Second Amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed. ” Garland , as the top cop in the country and a previous wannabe to the Supreme Court , insists that it is constitutional to infringe on the second amendment and the rights of the people to defend themselves . And , as the Supreme Court majority opinion noted today , The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion . I defy anyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution . It just is not there . The leftist communists make the claim that abortion falls under the right of privacy , yet that is not in the constitution either . Justice Harry Blackmun wrote the majority opinion in Roe , and even he admitted “ the Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. ” “ Abortion rights ” are in the Constitution ? Show me where . The interpretation of the U.S. Constitution is the primary job of the Supreme Court , yet Garland doesn ’ t even understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the Department of Justice to fight any decisions with which he does not agree . He will tie up the courts with unconstitutional cases that will take years to be overturned . Just like in the case of parents being treated as Domestic Terrorist , in which Garland misled Congress , he has said repeatedly that he will use all tools at his disposal , like the Patriot Act , to fight the law of the land if he disagrees with it , and he continues to disagree with the U.S. Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be so Communist , we thank God that he never made it to the Supreme Court .

"It is a fair assumption that Donald Trump has never driven a pickup truck, gone duck hunting, or glanced through Guns and Ammo. The totems of working-class white manhood are as foreign to his experience as they are to wine-track grandees such as California Governor Gavin Newsom. This cultural distance, however, has not prevented the Orange Autocrat from forming a bond of unprecedented closeness with downscale white-male America. Trump’s insight into the white working class is, in fact, his most potent political asset. The white working class has been an object of fascination since pollster Stan Greenberg published a landmark series of focus groups with white voters in the blue-collar Detroit suburb of Macomb County. Working-class whites propelled the New Right into two generations of political dominance, and their steady, if slightly fickle, trend toward Republican allegiance was a powerful headwind in the face of Democrats seeking to reconstitute their majority after the collapse of the New Deal coalition. Despite demographic changes in the country, working-class whites still represent the largest bloc of the electorate. They remain especially vital in Midwestern swing states and play an outsized role in determining which party controls the U.S. Senate. Thus, understanding the motivations of working-class white voting behavior has long been an important task for political professionals. On the left, analyses have ranged from Thomas Frank’s What’s The Matter With Kansas?, which championed the fantasy that left-wing populism can overcome the white working-class’s backlash mentality, no matter how unreceptive white workers have been to leftism of any kind; to harsh rebukes of the white working-class’s supposedly incorrigible racism. The American right has vacillated between reverence and contempt for the white working class, depending upon how the Republican Party has chosen to brand its eternal dogma of tax cuts and deregulation.",0
"In “The Wealth of Nations,” Adam Smith was absolutely right: The widespread division of labor would cause the interior life to die; an unsurprising result, for under capitalism, the human person became a commodity, a resource, a thing used to further profits. My parents, Romanian gypsies, born in a Transylvanian village and raised in thatched-roofed houses with dirt floors, heeded the inscription on the Statue of Liberty—“Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” Like the millions of immigrants before them, my parents worked hard, scraped together a few dollars, started a business, failed, and started all over again. But they never gave up. Their hard work and dogged determination finally resulted in financial success. My parents ran their store, Nick and Anna’s Grocery, according to the Romanian peasant understanding of social life. Our store served the rural community of Union Lake, forty miles west of Detroit. Most businessmen nowadays believe the purpose of a business is to make money, and consequently they readily destroy community.

China ’ s Tainqi Lithium is one of the largest manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries , an important component of electric vehicle batteries .

The latter has been considered a foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own dependence on China ’ s rare earth supply chain . Yates said the Biden administration should not make policies that support China ’ s interest in the renewable energy market and should urgently work to catch up by first using the resources it is endowed within the country .

This dependence needs to be addressed . The current situation is a significant source of US strategic vulnerability , ” said Hendrix . Yates called the administration ’ s focus on climate change a “ problematic proposition ” and said it can destroy the American economy even before the climate delivers disasters , because the green policies can increase fuel prices and likely become the cause of massive inflation . “ And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Yates . “ So hopefully , they will sober up and come back to work with Americans and more broadly in this hemisphere , to do things ourselves without having to rely on them [ China ] . ” The situation requires that the Biden administration think and act differently , he said . “ Part of it means focusing with renewed vigor on our own hemisphere , there ’ s a lot that we could be doing with countries like Brazil or other parts of our hemisphere . And other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding that rather than depending on China ’ s “ carnivorous market , ” the United States should also support countries in Asia and Africa to work with the other free world nations to undo China ’ s monopoly .

"2024 Republican Primary Vivek Ramaswamy Is Climbing. Where Can He Go? Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy gained almost 6 percentage points in FiveThirtyEight’s national polling average between July and the first Republican debate in late August. Al Drago / Bloomberg At last week’s Republican debate, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy arguably made the biggest splash of any candidate. Sharing center stage with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the entrepreneur spoke more than any contender other than former Vice President Mike Pence and even briefly surpassed the absent front-runner, former President Donald Trump, in Google search traffic. Built partly on his personal wealth and media savvy, Ramaswamy’s longshot candidacy has crystallized into something that is, if not quite at the level of constituting a serious challenge, at least competitive enough to draw more attention. On debate day, he stood at about 10 percent in FiveThirtyEight’s national polling average, up from 4 percent in early July. Similar to less heralded candidates who came before him, Ramaswamy is now facing more scrutiny from fellow Republicans and the media. His primary opponents criticized his positions and inexperience during the debate, while his comments about some issues — such as the possible involvement of the federal government in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks — have prompted journalists to more closely examine Ramaswamy. So as Ramaswamy stands on the precipice of becoming a big-time candidate, we took a look at who is backing him, what his potential ceiling might be and which other GOP candidate(s) he could take support from in the coming weeks and months.",0

""""""" If you want to understand the future of medical care for pregnant women in a post-Roe world , look no further than what is happening in Alabama . As others have pointed out for Slate , the leaked draft majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women ’ s Health Organization paves the way for criminalizing many aspects of pregnancy . While Texas ’ abortion ban , S.B . 8 , has essentially halted all abortions in the state , Alabama offers a glimpse of a troubling future in which the provision of medical care for pregnant people is deeply intertwined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminalize “ undesirable ” pregnancy outcomes . In the summer of 2020 , I got a firsthand experience of these attitudes in action . Three weeks after starting to practice at West Alabama Women ’ s Center , my application for a medical license was denied and my temporary medical license revoked for what we can ’ t help but question may have been political reasons . Although I had been hired to offer general gynecological care , the Women ’ s Center has historically been known as an abortion clinic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my views that abortion should be on demand . Because of the eight-month-long process to reverse and reinstate my license , I did not begin to understand how dire health care access was in Alabama until I was able to practice medicine in March 2021 . I was astounded by how often patients were turned away from emergency rooms and their doctor ’ s offices in the middle of their miscarriages . No wonder Alabama has the third-highest maternal mortality rate in the nation , I initially thought . People are denied urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering at first if health care providers were simply negligent and not keeping up with their medical education . Or was this lack of care a reflection of discrimination ? Eventually , I landed on discrimination as the cause . But I was wrong . The reality is much worse . Instead , these medical professionals seem to know what they are supposed to do , but choose not to . [ Read : Four Ways Blue Cities in Red States Can Protect Abortion Access Post-Roe ] I came to this realization when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( bleeding , passing clots , cramping ) who had just had an office visit with her primary physician . She was forced to wait more than 48 hours in order to get the results of her bloodwork . Doctors will sometimes check a patient ’ s levels of HCG , or human chorionic gonadotropin , to help distinguish miscarriages from ongoing pregnancies or ectopic pregnancies . I could not understand why someone with all of the clinical signs of a miscarriage in progress was required to wait for much-needed intervention , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was angry that the patient ’ s doctor did not just provide the standard medical treatment for a miscarriage : surgically removing the contents of her uterus , which would stop her pain and bleeding . Then I saw a different patient who was actively miscarrying , and a lightbulb clicked on : The doctors were afraid of being attacked by the state of Alabama . Medical providers who treat pregnancy-related issues in red states exist in a constant state of fear of performing any procedure that can be classified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know that we face the risk of being prosecuted , having our licenses revoked , or even being thrown in jail if we fail to precisely follow every regulation , no matter how arcane or medically unnecessary it is . ( We can be cited if the clinic ’ s janitor ’ s closet isn ’ t the size deemed appropriate by the state , for example . ) Part of the problem is a culture that has decided abortion is akin to killing a child . Morality aside , health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state to fear providing not only abortion care , but management of adverse pregnancy outcomes more generally . Abortion is outlawed in the state constitution , and state lawmakers made their moral position and hostility toward abortion clear in 2019 when Gov . Kay Ivey signed the Alabama Human Life Protection Act into law . The law banned abortions at every stage of pregnancy and criminalized doctors , charging them up to 99 years in prison for performing the procedure . Ultimately , a federal court overturned the law , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a “ trigger law ” that goes into effect as soon as Roe falls . Ivey celebrated the law at the time , lauding it as a restoration of the state ’ s position on abortion prior to Roe . “ In all meaningful respects , this bill closely resembles an abortion ban that has been a part of Alabama law for well over 100 years , ” Ivey said during the bill ’ s signing , before noting the law itself was “ unenforceable as a result of the U.S. Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enforceable or not , laws like this send a powerful message to doctors . As an OB-GYN , I work in active fear of being arrested for providing evidence-based health care in this state . I am certain that I am not alone . Intervening in an ongoing pregnancy would be examined as an “ abortion ” by the medical board and subject to the same scrutiny as any procedure I perform in my clinic . Doctors know that if you perform anything that could even be suspected of an abortion , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed to the letter . No wonder , even though we are directed under federal law to provide appropriate medical care to any pregnant person who shows up in the ER with a medical emergency , few in Alabama are willing to risk their careers and liberty to provide that care . Too often , I see and hear about examples of this stigma and fear at work when women come to me after being refused treatment in the local ER . For example , one patient started bleeding heavily at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , she said blood and clots ran down her legs and onto the floor . She rushed to the ER , where she told the nurse practitioner that she had taken mifepristone and misoprostol for a medication abortion 10 days earlier . The nurse practitioner knew the patient was experiencing an incomplete abortion , which happens when the body is not able to completely pass the pregnancy on its own . ( Miscarriage and abortion are often indistinguishable clinically , and that ’ s a huge problem because people miscarrying will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) As is protocol , the nurse practitioner called the OB-GYN on call . He said he would not see the patient . No further explanation was given . The nurse practitioner then tried involving the ER physician ; however , he was “ in a meeting ” and unavailable . Ultimately , she was told by hospital administrators to send the patient more than 2.5 hours away for care , back to the clinic that gave her the medication to end her pregnancy . Desperate for help , the nurse practitioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said that if the patient was safe to drive ( ride with a friend ) all that way , I would certainly provide the needed care . Sarah had an aspiration procedure with me that took less than seven minutes from start to finish . It was uncomplicated and safe . She later told me that she slept in the car during the 2.5-hour ride back home . Seven minutes could not be spared by the doctors at her local emergency room where she was bleeding on their floor . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another patient went to the doctor ’ s office because she knew something was wrong following a medication abortion . Her primary physician was a family medicine doctor trained in performing dilation and curettage procedures . The patient was having an incomplete abortion , and the remnants of the pregnancy needed to be evacuated from inside her uterus to stop her from bleeding and avoid infection and sepsis . Her doctor scheduled the D & C in the operating room for the next day , and the patient showed up on time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him he could not perform the D & C because “ it was not an emergency. ” The patient had to go back home , still bleeding . She called my clinic to see if we could help . I spoke with her doctor , who was denied the ability to perform the D & C . The hospital never gave him any more information , leaving him confused about why he could not care for his patient . Fortunately , she was able to make the two-hour trip to our clinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspiration procedure . These are just two examples from a wide spectrum of how even just the threat of criminalizing abortion results in discrimination against pregnant people , mutating reproductive health care into something it never should be : inaccessible and dangerous . Many of the medical professionals in Alabama who refuse to treat women who are miscarrying are not incompetent or hateful—they are scared . In no uncertain terms , these incidents will only get more frequent and more dangerous as more people—especially women of color—will be affected when the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dobbs . As we wait for the final ruling , which is expected in June , it is worth considering the reality already happening on the ground in states where stigma and laws against abortion have cowed providers into eschewing their responsibilities . It is truly unethical to turn away an actively bleeding patient in retaliation for them having chosen the still legal option to their own bodily autonomy , or to deny emergency medical care out of fear of financial , professional , and legal consequences from the state . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who need it , regardless of my personal views . I only wish the doctors and lawmakers of Alabama had done the same . Read more of Slate ’ s coverage on abortion rights here .

"In the wake of Hamas’s bloody and murderous raid into Israel, as Israeli jets pulverise the Gaza Strip in advance of its looming punitive expedition, the Western discourse surrounding the century-old conflict feels both novel and wearily familiar.

The effects are remarkable: though there is no obvious linkage between any of these matters, if I knew your opinions on wokeness or gender issues, or on Net Zero or Covid restrictions, then I could ascertain, with 99% accuracy, your opinions on a distant ethnic conflict in the Middle East.

"Alex Wong/Getty Images Mitt Romney chewed over taking another shot at the White House in 2016 as part of a longshot bid to stop Donald Trump, and briefly considered teaming up with avowed foe Ted Cruz to take the real estate mogul down, according to his forthcoming biography. McKay Coppins’ Romney: A Reckoning, claims that five days before the 2016 New Hampshire primary, Romney heard two allies out on a pitch that would have seen him pair up with Cruz on a last-minute unity ticket, according to The Guardian. They “called this the ‘Robert Kennedy’ strategy—get in late to build momentum, win enough delegates to keep the frontrunner from clinching the nomination,” Coppins writes, “then march into the convention girded for a floor fight.” The book says that Romney entertained the idea of the Texas senator, a man he’d described in his journal as “scary” and “a demagogue,” and told his allies his “number one priority [was] to stop Trump.” Ultimately, though, he “didn’t think the gambit would actually succeed in taking down Trump,” Coppins writes.

""""""" Q . Yesterday , you explained how DOE ’ s Office of Energy Efficient and Renewable Energy employs “ garbage-in , garbage-out ” ( GIGO ) to justify more stringent gas-appliance regulation . But step back : specifically , when and how did electrification become official energy policy ? Q . Please identify the primary Biden Administration regulatory chain of events that empowered this present “ transition ” to electrification through refocusing its mission on “ carbon efficiency. ” A . This expedited transition towards carbon efficiency was initiated by Biden ’ s Executive Order ( EO ) 13990 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis. ” ’ 86 FR 7037 ( Jan. 25 , 2021 ) . Section 1 of that Order lists several policies related to the protection of public health and the environment , including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and bolstering the Nation ’ s resilience to climate change . Id . at 86 FR 7037 , 7041 . Section 2 of the Order also instructs all agencies to review existing regulations , orders , guidance documents , policies , and any other similar agency actions promulgated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2017 , and January 20 , 2021 , that are or may be inconsistent with , or present obstacles to these policies . Agencies were directed , “ as appropriate and consistent with applicable law , ” to consider suspending , revising , or rescinding these [ Trump Administration ] agency actions and to immediately commence work to confront the “ climate crisis. ” A . In addition to EO 13990 , the Biden Administration environmental policies include a “ FACT SHEET ” titled President Biden Sets 2030 Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Securing U.S . Leadership on Clean Energy Technologies . Excerpt : “ [ This is ] a new target for the United States to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030. ” As part of re-entering the Paris Agreement , Biden also launched a “ whole-of-government ” process , organized through his National Climate Task Force , to establish this new 2030 emissions target—known as the “ nationally determined contribution ” or “ NDC , ” a formal submission to the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The present NDC is titled “ The United States of America Nationally Determined Contribution . Of particular importance is the following excerpt regarding building decarbonization : • “ Building sector emissions come from electricity use , as well as fossil fuels burned on site for heating air and water and for cooking . There are many options to avoid these emissions while reducing energy cost burden for families and improving health and resilience in communities . The emissions reduction pathways for buildings consider ongoing government support for energy efficiency and efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding for retrofit programs , wider use of heat pumps and induction stoves , and adoption of modern energy codes for new buildings . The United States will also invest in new technologies to reduce emissions associated with construction , including for high-performance electrified buildings. ” • “ It is therefore the policy of my Administration for the Federal Government to lead by example in order to achieve a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050. ” Q . So a whole new thrust behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s longstanding pro-electric biases get reformed at all during the Trump years ? A . Yes , but temporarily , as it is now turning out . But to give credit where credit is due , there was a brief ( but partial ) respite in EERE ’ s biased behavior under the Trump administration and EERE ’ s ( then ) Assistant Secretary Daniel Simmons . We could discuss some specific dockets later . Regardless , throughout the Trump Administration , EERE retained the “ clean energy ” mission of the Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of natural gas was never considered “ clean ” at least by EERE ’ s “ award winning ” staff ( even though gas-fueled combustion turbines were considered “ clean ” ) . The legislative stage was set before Trump with a lot of help from the “ usual suspects ” in writing the language . From the beginning of EERE , energy efficiency and renewable energy were “ joined at the hip . Read 42 U.S. Code § 16191 – Energy efficiency to see the result . The strong relationships between EERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs deep ; you wrote a good review of this in November of 2020 : Waste ? Speak for Yourself ( energy appliance mandates anti-consumer , pro-bureaucrat ) where I posted comments to it that elaborated on the subject . Q . What are the economic harms to the American economy and energy consumers by all of this ? What are other ill-effects ? and what can be realistically done to start rectifying it ? A . This gets to the macro-policy associated with climate alarmism/forced energy transformation . President Trump was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it devastates consumer choice and our economy by vastly escalating energy costs . That is why I twice voted for him . Biden ’ s reentering the Paris Agreement—and his NDC plan to achieve it—is non-binding and has yet to be ratified by Congress . Accordingly , the Paris Agreement and the NDC are not “ applicable law. ” However , it remains to be seen who is willing to legally challenge these policies . This “ transition ” —which directly conflicts with the EPCA ’ s ( the Energy Policy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent to protect consumers against regulatory overreach—also strengthens the economic and strategic hands of “ bad ” international actors , while weakening international “ social justice ” and increasing adverse environmental impacts associated with growing the market share of “ renewable ” wind and solar energy . Q . The “ clean energy ” ruse plays into all of this . Q . This has been a major area of research for you . A. I reviewed and reported upon most of the costing studies available up to 2019 in Costing the Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Some Clarifications . I collaborated with Tom Tanton who recently published some “ do-it-yourself ” estimating tools and users guide available from the Energy & Environmental Legal Institute . And Minnesota ’ s Center of the American Experiment has an outstanding series on “ clean ” energy costs as well . Overall , excluding deadweight losses , total cost for the “ clean energy transition ” appear to be around $ 30 Trillion ( ± $ 10 Trillion ) . If deadweight losses are included , costs could triple . For every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitioning to all-electric economy , the AGW environmentalists have dozens , with the usual theme that “ clean ” energy will cost much less than continuing to use fossil fuels . Personally , I don ’ t see any interest on the other side to debate anything . Rather , they seem to think their environmental nirvana can only be achieved by replacing our free-market system . For that , they want a “ green ” form of socialism . In which case , Pol Pot would be proud . A . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on inherently unreliable “ clean ” energy can and does kills people . Take Texas for example . During last February ’ s “ Winter Storm Uri , 210 people officially died because of prolonged electricity outages . While many died of hypothermia and carbon monoxide poisoning , many also died because they were dependent upon various sorts of electric powered medical equipment . Even if people had gas furnaces and boilers , those appliances require electric blowers and/or pumps to operate , However , if people also had gas stoves they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep themselves ( and their water pipes ) from freezing . And it looks like history in Texas is poised to repeat itself , as Donn Dears point out here : Texas Remains in Peril . Q . And with this comes unintended consequences . Mark Krebs , a mechanical engineer and energy policy analyst , has been involved with energy efficiency design and program evaluation for more than thirty years . He has served as an expert witness in dozens of State energy efficiency proceedings , has been an advisor to DOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filings . Mark ’ s first article was in the and was titled “ It ’ s a War Out There : A Gas Man Questions Electric Efficiency ” ( December 1996 ) . For more about Mark , see his MasterResource archive .

"He met Sara Ben-Artzi in 1988 on a layover at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. She was 30 and a flight attendant; he was 39 and Israel’s deputy foreign minister. They went out on several dates, but according to Ben Caspit’s “The Netanyahu Years,” there was no great chemistry. Soon after that, he told friends that they broke up. By 1991, they had reunited. They married in March of that year at his parents’ house in Jerusalem; Sara was visibly pregnant. Two years later, Netanyahu shocked the nation when he went on the air and confessed to having cheated on his new wife. In the aftermath of the affair, there were reports in the Israeli press about rumors that Sara had agreed to take him back only after making him sign some sort of secret agreement stipulating that he could not have contact with other women without her knowledge and could go hardly anywhere without her. She also intervened at work. “Sara was shot into the Prime Minister’s Office as from a cannon,” Caspit writes in his book. The former senior aide to Netanyahu told me, “Our whole goal was to build a layer of defense around Bibi to protect him from Sara’s madness and allow him to do his work.” The portrait that emerges from such stories is of a scorned, grifting, raging woman. In various successful lawsuits and investigative reports over the years, this portrait appears to bear out. Since his indictment in 2019, Netanyahu’s bond with Sara seems to have hardened. In their view, they are victims of a state plot to unseat them. The state prosecution claims that from 2011 to 2016, Netanyahu accepted a steady supply of cigars, cases of Champagne and jewelry from Arnon Milchan, an Israeli film producer in Hollywood, and James Packer, an Australian billionaire. In exchange for these presents, estimated to have been worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, the prosecution says that Netanyahu lobbied U.S. officials to help Milchan renew his U.S. visa and tried to lighten his tax burden in Israel. (Milchan and Packer are not on trial, and Packer has not been accused of a quid pro quo.) A former Netanyahu spokesman who turned state witness in 2018 told prosecutors that he had learned of “a method, let’s say, in which, on every visit abroad, the Netanyahu family was attached to a walking credit card on two legs” — meaning to local benefactors.",0

""""""" The Willis Tower was built with cutting-edge technology and ageless chutzpah , a word that could be translated as an intoxicating sense of omnipotence . When planning for what was originally called Sears Tower — a name many still use — began , the company had 350,000 employees . Half of America ’ s households had a Sears credit card . The company ’ s future seemed to carry a lifetime guarantee . “ Being the largest retailer in the world we thought we should have the largest headquarters in the world , ” Gordon Metcalf , its board chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoed the Biblical account of what inspired the Tower of Babel ’ s builders : “ Come , let us build ourselves a city , with a tower that reaches to the heavens , so that we may make a name for ourselves. ” [ Follow along with all of our 175th anniversary coverage ] By that standard , the Sears Tower was a success . The 110-story skyscraper at 233 S. Wacker Drive was the world ’ s tallest for more than two decades and remains popularly known by its maiden name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a London-based insurance brokerage in 2009 But Sears Roebuck and Co. has all but vanished . The Tower has had multiple owners , and its appeal was at least momentarily diminished in the months following the terrorist attacks of 9/11 more than 20 years ago . Today the city ’ s tallest skyscraper faces the same pandemic-related issues as office buildings throughout the Loop as workers continue to work from home , throwing the continuing vitality of downtown Chicago into question . Barclays Bank , a venerable British investment house , once posited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data crunchers said that cities build their tallest structures on the eve of their decline . How accurately does that algorithm measure Sears Tower and the city it looks down upon ? In the beginning , the massive building gave a shot in the arm to its immediate environs . It replaced the unsightly remnants of Chicago ’ s garment district on the western edge of the Loop . “ A jumble of 15 grime-blackened buildings , ” the Tribune called it . Their demolition surely enhanced a visitor ’ s image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of its corporate parent . As the high-rise was going up in the early 1970s , the company had about $ 9 billion in annual sales revenue . Its Tower was similarly voracious . At 1,451 feet , it was the world ’ s tallest building and held that distinction for more than two decades . To reach that height required 76,000 tons of steel , 2.5 million cubic feet of concrete , 25,000 miles of plumbing , and 43,000 miles of telephone cable . “ On behalf of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confidence they are showing in the future in planning and designing the building which will adorn the West Side , ” Mayor Richard J. Daley said in 1970 . Sears Tower spurred the redevelopment along the Chicago River ’ s west banks and in adjoining neighborhoods . But it didn ’ t ring the corporate cash registers . By 1991 , Walmart ’ s sales had overtaken Sears ’ , which went through a long decline before filing for bankruptcy in 2018 . The company sold Sears Tower and closed stores but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loan keeping it afloat . Sears left the building for corporate campus in Hoffman Estates in the 1992 , a move that bruised Chicago ’ s civic pride and complicated commutes for many employees . “ How will I get there ? ” was the most asked question from staffers , recalled Barb Lehman , the Sears executive who directed the exodus of 5,000 from Chicago to suburbia . Sears was founded in 1892 and virtually invented home shopping with a catalog as thick as Chicago ’ s telephone directory . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer goods as their urban counterparts with access to stores . Sears provided the model that Amazon would later capitalized on , but it wasn ’ t nimble enough to adapt to the digital age . Instead it focused on bricks-and-mortar stores , famed for replacing tools if they broke , and down-to-earth clothing and appliances . Their shelves reflected the same spread of good-better-best offerings as the Sears catalog . Rival department stores specialized in a segment of the retail market : Marshall Field ’ s on high-end offerings and fashion-conscious customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and budget-conscious shoppers . In 2002 , Sears bought Lands ’ End , known for hip casual wear , but sales continued to dive . “ Sears is like a dinosaur , ” Joe Cushman who retired as Sears chairman in 1967 , once observed . “ You hit it five times on the tail with a sledgehammer , and 11 years later the impulse will reach the brain. ” His successors ignored Cushman ’ s diagnosis . Perhaps ambitious architects seduced them into thinking of Sears as too big to fail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client a far larger building than the company ’ s honchos likely envisioned . “ Sears probably would have settled for a squatty 50- or 60-story building — something sturdy , efficient and durable , ” said Fazlur Khan , the structural engineer who , with architect Bruce Graham , drew plans for the tower . “ But we wanted something that wouldn ’ t be too prismatic. ” Khan was apparently taking a dig at the Loop ’ s more nondescript buildings , a mold Paul Gapp , the Tribune ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke away from by designing a skyscraper “ whose exteriors are a bold , vital , and exciting departure from orthodox mediocrity. ” After Sears cut its Tower loose , others bought and sold it , even when it teetered on a precipice of bankruptcy . Trizec Properties inherited Sears ’ responsibility for loan payments due MetLife and , unable to make a 2003 installment , gave the keys to the building to the insurance company . “ There is some tarnish on the diamond now , but it will come back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Trammell Crow realty company , told the Tribune . “ And in the long run there is some potential upside. ” Evidently Szady knew how the real estate market works . Prospective buyers continued to make offers , and financial institutions were willing to cover bets on Sears Tower ’ s value . Blue-chip companies took over the 1.5 million square feet vacated by Sears . When tenants moved out , others moved in . United Airlines reversed Sears ’ suburban flight , transferring its operations center ’ s 2,000 flight controllers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Willis Tower in 2009 . It was tempted to make the move in part by Chicago ’ s offer of about $ 25 million in incentives , the Tribune reported , while also noting : “ United is drawing fire from aviation experts who question why it would locate its nerve center in a building identified as a potential target of terrorists. ” That year , five would-be American terrorists were convicted of plotting to bomb Sears Tower . Indeed , the Tower ’ s appeal was previously impacted by Al Qaida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s World Trade Center towers . “ You can completely forget about Sept. 11 , but as soon as you go back into that building , you think about it again , ” said Alain Coque , an executive of New Mark Co. , whose clients were looking at office space in Sears Tower . The Tower got an emotional lift in 2015 , when the Blackstone Group bought it for $ 1.3 billion , a record for an office building beyond Manhattan . The New York private equity group softened its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lower-level mall , putting $ 500 million into a renovation project dubbed the Catalogue . Restaurants , a food court , and shops reintroduced the Tower as more than just a place to work . COVID struck as the project , just completed in May , was well underway . “ On Thursday between 8 and 9 a.m. , Tribune reporters counted 75 people passing through its main entrance , ” the paper reported on September 25 , 2020 . Before the epidemic , 15,000 employees arrived there daily . So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Has working from home become the new norm ? Management ’ s upbeat forecasts of the Tower ’ s rebound are diluted by unintended cautionary notes such as ballyhooing “ shared workspaces. ” That sounds like a franchised motel touting its business center rather than a sales pitch for an exclusive skyscraper . It would be more convincing if the Tower ’ s flacks spoke with the authoritative self-assurance of Sears founder Richard Sears , who built an empire with his catalog ’ s no-ifs ands-or-buts promise of customer satisfaction .

"Vivek Ramaswamy at his anti-China campaign rally in New Albany, Ohio. | Taylor Dorrell / People's World NEW ALBANY, Ohio—There are more than a few themes that excite a contemporary Republican crowd in Central Ohio: opposing “big government,” calling out “woke” culture and denying election results among them. Right-wing Ohioan Vivek Ramaswamy doesn’t stray from this template. During his September rally in New Albany, the biggest applause followed lines about being pro-capitalism, anti-gender studies, and diametrically opposed to the very existence of China. Outside of Axium Plastics, where Ramaswamy held his rally, signs lined the sidewalk with quotes reading “reverse racism is racism” and “the nuclear family is the greatest form of governance known to mankind.” The mostly older, white crowd approved of these treatises and seemed eager to receive the message crudely printed on the candidate’s short podium: “Declare independence from Communist China.”",0
"Here we go again. On Sept. 12, soon-to-be-deposed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced an “impeachment investigation” into President Biden. McCarthy was clearly trying to appease the extreme right-wingers in his party, who are upset that the speaker hasn’t been sufficiently radical over budget negotiations. And of course, McCarthy presented absolutely zero evidence Biden has done anything warranting impeachment. But in the post-fact vacuum that is the Republican mindset, no evidence the president has done anything wrong is simply evidence he’s hiding something. The only thing that McCarthy even mentioned related to the inquiry—a “culture of corruption”—is patently bogus in relation to this White House. But Hunter Biden is another matter, and it’s clear the GOP is going to use the president’s errant son as a wedge to pry out any grain of dirt they can find to stop this administration from governing before the election next year, at which point they can return Donald Trump to power. There’s a lot to say about this—how the Biden administration specifically, and Democrats generally, haven’t done enough to distance themselves from Hunter Biden’s failings; how problematic presidential relatives go all the way back to Payne Todd, the albatross stepson to James Madison; and how all this plays into a looming government shutdown (especially with the House thrown into chaos by the self-imposed decapitation within the GOP) and the election next year. So let’s just leave that here, because something bigger is at stake, and not just whether or not McCarthy will carry through with his threat to impeach Biden.",0

Qurayshi was a close companion to Zarqawi and Baghdadi , providing both legitimacy and continuity when he took over following Baghdadi ’ s death . However , most members of this founding generation have been killed , which raises serious problems about the future leadership and direction of the movement . On the other hand , Qurayshi ’ s death will not radically derail the group ’ s sprawling operations , which stretch across many theaters worldwide . Increasingly resourceful and agile , the Islamic State has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a decentralized , largely rural , but nonetheless resilient insurgency . The death of another top leader is unlikely to make a huge difference in this diffuse and lethal insurgency in Syria , Iraq , Afghanistan , and beyond . Indeed , if past experience is a guide , Qurayshi ’ s killing will have more of a tactical than a strategic impact on the Islamic State . For example , after the defeat of the Islamic State ’ s territorial caliphate in 2019 and the death of its charismatic leader Baghdadi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , then-President Donald Trump prematurely declared that “ [ w ] e have defeated ISIS ” and that U.S. troops in Syria ( and Iraq ) would all come back home . Trump ’ s triumphalism recalled former U.S. President George W. Bush ’ s infamous “ Mission Accomplished ” speech immediately after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and occupation of Iraq . Yet just as Bush ’ s rosy proclamation proved to be embarrassingly short-sighted , so did Trump ’ s . In neither Iraq nor in Syria is the mission accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet permanently defeated . Long before the loss of its physical caliphate in Iraq and Syria in 2017 and 2019 ( respectively ) , the Islamic State plotted for the morning after . By sending fighters and midlevel lieutenants to the mountains and deserts and other secured areas in Iraq and Syria , the group has been able to survive without having a physical base . Moreover , Islamic State members were also sent to Afghanistan , Libya , and other parts of Africa to establish bases and expand operations . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State has been able to sustain itself amid the loss of its territorial caliphate in Syria and Iraq . With an estimated 10,000 active , radicalized combatants still willing to give their lives for the group ’ s cause , the Islamic State today has the ability and willpower to carry on a prolonged struggle . Midlevel operators have operational autonomy and can act without higher-up authority . In the past three years , the Islamic State has carried out thousands of deadly hit-and-run attacks in Iraq , Syria , and elsewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , local leaders , and village notables , and imposing its authority and control over rural Sunni communities . Days before the raid that killed Qurayshi , the Islamic State launched a highly complex and coordinated attack on a prison in the city of Hasaka in northeastern Syria , which housed more than 3,000 suspected members of the group and almost 700 boys who were children of Islamic State fighters . Two suicide car bombers blew the prison entrance open and allowed for more than a dozen fighters to enter and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times reports that Islamic State sleeper cells also seized buildings and grain silos in residential neighborhoods in Hasaka and attacked reinforcements sent by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces ( SDF ) to regain control of the prison . The SDF controls this area , and U.S. troops are based there as well . The ability of Islamic State sleeper cells to infiltrate this sensitive area shows daring and sophisticated operational preplanning . Even with the United States assisting with armored vehicles , attack helicopters , and airstrikes , it took Kurdish-led forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State gunmen from the prison . In the process , dozens of Kurdish militia members and hundreds of Islamic State members were killed , testifying to the intensity and resilience of the group . That the Islamic State was planning a daring , large-scale attack on the prison was an open secret . U.S. and Kurdish-led forces had known in advance that the group had repeatedly promised to free its captive fighters . In fact , as the New York Times reported , “ A senior American official , speaking on the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the operation was to free some of the group ’ s senior or midlevel leaders and fighters with specific skills , like bomb-making. ” The official estimated that about 200 prisoners had gotten out of the prison . Those 200 hardened combatants will add even more fuel and firepower to the group ’ s unfolding insurgency in Syria , Iraq , and neighboring countries . There is also growing evidence that the Islamic State has been steadily renewing its ranks with younger recruits , mainly from families with older members who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as from internally displaced and excluded Sunnis . This should not come as a shock when one considers that years after the expulsion of the Islamic State from key urban centers in Iraq , the country remains dotted with tens of thousands of internally displaced Sunnis who are treated with disdain and exclusion . Relatives of Islamic State members have been implicated by association and placed in detention camps , a fact that has created resentment and even radicalization . Similarly , in Syria , the dismantling of the group ’ s territorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor prosperity . Civil strife and geostrategic rivalries have turned the country into a magnet for extremists of all colors and stripes , including al Qaeda , the Islamic State , and sectarian militias . It is no wonder then that both Baghdadi and Qurayshi were based in Idlib near the Syrian-Turkish border , an area that lies outside of Syrian government control and is home to millions of Syrian refugees and foreign fighters . Foreign governments have refused to repatriate thousands of citizens accused of being Islamic State fighters and tens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SDF has been unable to fully secure prisons and detention camps . There is a real danger that these camps could become incubators for the next generation of Islamic State fighters . Yet the Islamic State isn ’ t a strategic threat . It is vulnerable and fragile . The group no longer controls significant territory and is scattered all over . It has lost not just its caliphate but also the top lieutenants and enforcers who had consolidated its territory and kept the population in check . The Islamic State is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deserts from which it carries out attacks . Nevertheless , the persistence of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria shows the urgent need to address legitimate Sunni grievances through healing , reconciliation , and the reconstruction of the Iraqi and Syrian states based on the rule of law , citizenship , and inclusiveness . Of course , this is easier said than done . But the Islamic State is a symptom of both the breakdown of state institutions in the heart of the Arab and Islamic world and the intense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s internal affairs . The most effective way to prevent the Islamic State ’ s resurgence depends on the ability of Arab and Muslim societies , together with the regional and great powers , to work toward a political resolution of communal violence and to embark on projects of state-building that are based on transparency and legitimacy . Civil strife and violence in conflict zones in Syria , Iraq , Yemen , Libya , Somalia , Afghanistan , West Africa , and elsewhere are the key ingredients to the survival and consolidation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The international community can deny them these ingredients by helping to end prolonged local conflicts such as the one between Israelis and Palestinians , and geostrategic rivalries such as that between Saudi Arabia and Iran , both of which have provided ideological nourishment to nonstate actors , including the Islamic State . This , far more than the death of any one leader , will help put a permanent end to the Islamic State and similar groups . """"""",0

""""""" ALBANY , N.Y. — The road for control of the House might just run along the Hudson River . Instead of serving up new Democratic lawmakers for Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a mix of open seats and new ones drawn up in New York 's messy redistricting process have turned a deep blue state into a battleground as Democrats are desperate to defend their thin margins in Washington . At least a half dozen congressional races stretching from Long Island to Ithaca will be instrumental in deciding whether Republicans are positioned to drown the remainder of President Joe Biden 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad press going into 2024 . By many predictions , New York has as many contested seats as any state in the nation , and POLITICO ’ s Election Forecast puts two as toss-ups ; three as leaning Democratic and one leaning Republican . That makes New York — which has n't elected a Republican statewide in 20 years — one of the most unlikely stages of political theater this election cycle . “ I ’ ll only tell you this — we ’ re going to be competitive in every race that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win . We understand we ’ re going to have to work hard , and we ’ re prepared to do that , '' state Democratic Committee chairman Jay Jacobs said . The National Republican Campaign Committee is savoring the moment , saying they see New York ripe for pickups in November . “ Democrats are on defense in more seats than they ever would have liked because every single one of their extreme liberal candidates backs a pro-criminal , reckless spending agenda that ’ s hurting every New Yorker , ” NRCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been criticized for partially putting themselves in the unenviable position of having to defend seats that they hoped would be safe . An overzealous attempt to draw district lines could have yielded Democrats as many as 22 of the state ’ s 26 districts . Democrats now hold 19 of 27 House seats in New York ; the state is losing a seat next year due to population declines . In April , the state ’ s top court struck down Democrats ' map for being too gerrymandered , leaving it to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw new maps that put more seats in play than anyone envisioned . Still , Democrats have renewed optimism about picking up seats after Pat Ryan ’ s special election win last month in the Hudson Valley signaled their fortunes might not be as bad as they ’ d thought as he ran heavily on a pro-abortion-rights platform that resonated with voters in the swing district . “ We ’ re going to be very clear about the choice that voters have this year , and that ’ s between a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election — in many cases support of the Jan. 6 insurrection — and doing everything it can in turning back the clock , like reveling in the overturning of Roe . v Wade , '' Jacobs said . Republicans , meanwhile , say a “ red wave ” is an inevitable consequence of a midterm election when the opposing party is in control at both state and federal levels — the only question is how large it will be . `` The message is one of optimism from the NYGOP perspective , '' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who himself is running for Congress in November after winning a Western New York primary last month . `` We have an embarrassment of riches of a lot of great candidates and a lot of great races . '' Big money is flowing to endangered incumbents , and all predictions are tempered by the lack of precedent in the brand-new court-drawn districts . “ Put that all in a blender and you have chaos , ” said longtime New York Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf , who has not aligned with any campaign this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House races for decades . Turnout in November will also be uniquely unpredictable . Historically , “ in Manhattan people will think about national politics ; in the suburbs , people will think about local conditions and who to blame , ” Sheinkopf said . The extent of their excitement in a non-presidential year is unclear , especially as issues like gun laws and abortion rights driving increased engagement elsewhere are making less difference in New York , where Democrats have largely locked them into state law . The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sean Patrick Maloney at the helm — is focusing on claiming six districts in Central New York , the Hudson Valley , Staten Island and Long Island with a renewed emphasis on reproductive rights that played well in Ryan ’ s special election win and as he runs for a full term Nov. 8 . Strategists acknowledge that of the six , Democrats are least likely to find success against the two GOP incumbents — Staten Island ’ s Rep. Nicole Malliotakis and Long Island ’ s Rep. Andrew Garbarino — but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their opponents to former President Donald Trump and his supporters from the party ’ s more extremist wings . Republicans might not need to flip any New York districts that Biden carried in 2020 to reclaim the majority ; in all , Republicans need to net only five seats to win the gavel . The party in New York has strong contenders to hold onto open GOP seats that include those being vacated by Long Island Rep. Lee Zeldin , who is running for governor , and Central New York ’ s Rep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not run for reelection . `` If you think where this year started and oddly how it ’ s going to end : The Democrats had ever intention of taking us down to four seats , and here we are possibly fighting for 11 or 12 , '' Langworthy said . Here ’ s a look at the key New York House races : On the eastern end of Long Island , the race to succeed Zeldin is a complete toss-up on paper : Biden and Trump split the vote almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a bit of an oddity for a Long Island contest by historical standards — it completely dodges any of the state Senate districts that are likely to be battlegrounds within it . Zeldin , now the Republican gubernatorial nominee , will presumably help his party win at least some support at the top of the ballot in November . LaLota is the chief of staff of the presiding officer of the Suffolk County Legislature and has served various roles in county government throughout the years . He won a three-way primary broadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s ties to Trump . He faces Fleming , a Suffolk County legislator , former prosecutor and Southampton Town councilwoman , who ran unopposed in the primary . The contest to succeed outgoing Democrat Rep. Tom Suozzi in a district that Democrats have held for decades and Joe Biden won by 10 points isn ’ t usually ranked at the top of lists of New York ’ s most competitive districts . But the local election results in 2021 were as bad for Democrats as anywhere in the country . Republicans won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Hempstead , which makes up a third of the congressional seat ’ s population and had previously been controlled by Democrats since the 1980s . The DCCC added the district to its “ Red to Blue ” program just last week , providing Democratic National Committee member and longtime public affairs executive Zimmerman additional resources in the campaign against Republican investment banker Santos . The seat being vacated by Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice began to emerge as competitive to some local observers in just the past few months , thanks to Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially sensitive to local politics . The November matchup pits former Hempstead supervisor Gillen , who became the first Democrat elected to the position in more than a century , against Hempstead Town Board member D'Esposito , a volunteer firefighter and retired New York City police detective . Gillen lost her supervisor reelection bid to a Republican in 2019 , showing just how swiftly Hempstead ’ s political winds can shift . She beat three other Democrats in the August primary . D ’ Esposito ran unopposed in the primary and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March . The seat containing Staten Island and a sliver of Brooklyn has been one of the state ’ s most back-and-forth in recent years , with Rose turning it blue with 53 percent of the vote in 2018 and Malliotakis winning it back for Republicans two years later , similarly with 53 percent of the vote . The Democratic-drawn lines seemed poised to make it a lot less competitive , turning it from a district where Trump received 55 percent of the vote in 2020 to one where he received 45 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely the same as it had been for the past decade , creating a district where Trump received 46 percent . The redesign has been widely assumed to leave Malliotakis as the frontrunner as the two face off in a rematch . But the tiny shift towards the Democratic column in the final maps means there ’ s a path for a Rose victory , particularly if some of the Staten Islanders who were Trump fans don ’ t participate in a midterm election . Maloney , the five-term House member , soundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biaggi , in the Aug. 23 primary , with hearty fundraising and widespread support from establishment Democrats across the nation . But he faces another challenge in his new Hudson Valley district against his GOP opponent , state Assemblyman Lawler , who is painting Maloney as a wealthy member of the Washington establishment and has tied him and his congressional colleagues to high inflation , crime and tax rates . Some polling has suggested the two are neck-and-neck in the Hudson Valley district , and the GOP ’ s Congressional Leadership Fund recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lawler . Eleven weeks after winning a special election to serve in Congress for the remainder of the year , Ryan will be back on the ballot in a seat that ’ s a bit more Democratic-friendly . The new district chops pieces of nine mostly rural counties from the one that was the site of the last month 's election and adds Orange County and Poughkeepsie . That turns it from a seat that Biden won by about 1 percentage point to one that he won by more than 8 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ’ ll have the advantages of incumbency for the homestretch of his new election , as well as a massive amount of national exposure that would help his fundraising . Schmitt , a sophomore member of the state Assembly , outperformed Trump by 6 points in his district in 2020 . Molinaro would ’ ve been the undisputed frontrunner in this race if it happened a couple of weeks ago . In a district that ’ s a toss-up on paper , he had far more experience campaigning and better name recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But his loss to Ryan means he won ’ t enter the race with the advantages of incumbency and the fact that he lost the summer ’ s highest-profile election will likely scare off at least some potential donors . The district is changed a bit from the one he ran in a couple of weeks ago — it notably sheds a piece of Molinaro ’ s home county of Dutchess , where he is county executive — but it ’ s not dramatically different politically . It loses most of the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the Democratic stronghold of Tompkins County , which includes the college town of Ithaca . Rural counties like Schoharie are no longer in the district , but they are replaced by rural counties that include Chemung along the Pennsylvania border . All those changes turned it from a seat where Biden received 51 percent of the vote to one where he received 52 percent . Riley , an Ithaca attorney , handily won the Democratic primary to run against Molinaro . The new 22nd District that includes much of Syracuse emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state when the safe Democrats ' seat was redrawn after New York ’ s maps were declared improperly gerrymandered .

"Few people would have imagined that, by autumn 2023, Greece’s Syriza would no longer be led by Alexis Tsipras, nor any other high-ranking party official, but by a centrist business magnate who has spent most of his adult life in the United States – a man who is not a member of the Hellenic Parliament, who has no history of progressive activism (unless we count volunteering for one of Joe Biden’s Senate campaigns), and who was not even involved with Syriza until the moment he decided to become its leader. Yet this is the story of 35-year-old Stefanos Kasselakis, who was elected last month after a democratic process that included more than 140,000 party members and supporters. A graduate of UPenn’s Wharton School who worked as an analyst at Goldman Sachs before founding three successful shipping companies, Kasselakis was keen to stress his entrepreneurial experience during his campaign. He also emphasized that, in a country which has seen three prime ministers from the Papandreou family, two from the Karamanlis family and two from the Mitsotakis family, he does not come from a political dynasty. This combination of ‘expertise’ and ‘outsider status’ was enough to convince the Syriza faithful. How did this happen? Why did a party supposedly rooted in the traditions of the left anoint someone to whom they are entirely alien? According to opinion polls, Syriza voters wanted a leader who could stand up to Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s New Democracy government, whose current popularity outstrips that of the opposition by more than twenty percentage points. They came to view Kasselakis – openly gay, photogenic and social-media savvy, adept at attacking the incumbent while avoiding the langue de bois of the traditional left – as the best option. Yet this was also thanks to the flat-footed performance of his rival, Efi Achtsiouglou, the former Minister of Labour who was widely believed to be Tsipras’s heir apparent. Though she made a last-minute attempt to frame the contest as a face-off between the centre and the left, she otherwise ran a moderate, timorous campaign – insisting that regaining power meant relinquishing any pretensions to radicalism. If Kasselakis’s politics are roughly equivalent to Biden’s, Achtsiouglou styled herself as something like the Greek Sana Marin.",0

Israel, a high-tech power, would play a major role in ambitious Saudi plans to move its economy beyond oil.

"Kathryn: Yeah, I think that association is there—that boycotts and consumer activism, these are tools of the left—but it’s always been a little more complicated than that. Lawrence Glickman, a historian at Cornell, has written about this a lot in looking at how pro-segregationist activists in the South in the 1950s and ’60s were calling for boycotts of car companies that supported integration or even boycotting television shows that had interracial casts. I think that there had been concern, even among leaders on the right, about how well this would work. Ted Cruz at some point in the spring said, This is all well and good, but traditionally, conservatives have not been very good at following through on their boycotts. But Professor Glickman did tell me, this does feel a little different. This is going on longer and has more durability than some of those earlier boycotts did, and also corporations seem more frightened than they had in the past. There is a sense that maybe this is leading into a new moment, because we have just this deeply embedded polarization at this point and consumer politics is being brought into it, and the ways in which consumerism becomes a marker of identity is now more deeply tied to people’s sense of values.

""""""" Before getting to this soundbite , a note for those who travel the deep weeds . Notice how whenever Fauci is answering questions on COVID subjects that are positive to his worldview , he uses the phrase “ we “ , including himself in the conduct of health officials . However , whenever Fauci is answering questions that are critical of health officials , he uses the phrase “ they “ , to distance his role in the decision-making . This is a key ¹*tell* in any conversation with leadership and/or teambuilders . In this soundbite [ full interview here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CDC guidance on quarantine exit is likely to change , specifically because the feedback from media has been critical .

Notice in the full interview ( below ) Stephanopoulos asks if the media should stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the media motive is to stop the criticism of the Biden administration . Going deeper on the introductory point : Blame-casting is a profoundly negative leadership trait , with horrific consequences . Stable executives , those with extraordinary skills at leading massive institutions , always look for this blame-casting trait when listening to peers , lower-level executives and teambuilders within the organization . ¹The most effective leaders , people of the most consequential influence , listen 95 % of the time and speak only about 5 % of the time .

"Welcome back to The Best & The Brightest. Salutations! Tina Nguyen here, with something a bit different this week for The Best & The Brightest. Since Trump is still the frontrunner and the Republicans still haven’t elected a Speaker (there you go, that’s your daily update), this seems to be a perfect week to take a break from the noise and examine a growing, consequential, and somehow juicy feud inside the right-wing think tank world over who, exactly, gets to be in the Trump administration… But first, here’s Abby Livingston with the latest on Capitol Hill… Two Strikes on Jordan The House may look like it’s falling deeper into a stalemate with each yawn-inducing roll call vote, but behind the scenes the political situation is turbulent and unstable. For all the prognosticators, pundits and soothsayers, no one has any earthly idea what the coming days and weeks will bring. Here’s the latest dish and intrigue from the salt mines… Death by a Thousand Nos: CNN’s Melanie Zanona posted a delicious piece of reporting on Wednesday afternoon perfectly characterizing the uniquely acute agony of the situation. “Some of Jim Jordan‘s opponents tell me they’ve been purposely staggering their ‘no’ votes over multiple ballots—a strategy designed to show Jordan’s speakership opposition is only growing,” she noted. It’s probably not that unusual for members to regularly vote against one’s beliefs on the House floor, but to brag about it? That is some kind of vulcan chess amid an increasingly volatile situation. And this was not a mere procedural matter—this was a deeply personal vote for the Speaker of the House. Members’ yes votes (and their subsequent no votes) will forever be enshrined on the record. Or perhaps Kay Granger, Don Bacon and 18 other Republicans took a risky and lonely vote on Tuesday and their colleagues learned that there was life after crossing the hardliners. This sorta feels like the last kid to jump on the desk in Dead Poets Society taking the same amount of credit for bravery as Ethan Hawke’s character. Oh, McHenry: Since Congress returned from summer recess, one recurring name in my conversations with House Republican operatives has been speaker pro tempore , Patrick McHenry . First elected in 2004, he’s long been a behind-the-scenes fixture and leader in the conference. These conversations inevitably home in on McHenry’s competence —not a word frequently used in conversations regarding any other House Republicans in leadership roles right now. It’s my sense that even if Kevin McCarthy had not selected him as speaker pro tempore , McHenry would still be in consideration to lead the House long term. Even a Democrat who served on the Financial Services Committee, which McHenry now chairs, described him glowingly on Wednesday afternoon. That’s not to say he is moderate, or lacks in partisan instincts—in fact, he’s tangled on very personal terms with Elizabeth Warren . In a separate incident, McHenry so incensed Bill Pascrell that the Democrat demanded that McHenry apologize “to all of New Jersey.” But unlike McCarthy, there is at least a baseline of trust between Democrats and McHenry. Since Congress returned from summer recess, one recurring name in my conversations with House Republican operatives has been speaker , . First elected in 2004, he’s long been a behind-the-scenes fixture and leader in the conference. Fog of War: As unstable as the climate is on the Republican side of the chamber, Democrats continue to show total unity in this speaker’s fight. That said, tensions over the war in Israel are escalating. Most recently, Rashida Tlaib posted (along with reputable news outlets) on Tuesday allegations that Israel bombed a Gaza hospital. On Wednesday, after both Joe Biden and the top members of the Intel committees all stated that Israel did not attack the hospital, Tlaib still kept her post up. In a veiled response, Josh Gottheimer wrote: “Erroneous reports and some Members of Congress took the word of Hamas terrorists as truth following the horrific Al-Ahli Arab Hospital bombing. They should remove their posts, update their headlines, and remember not to trust terrorists who brutally murdered innocent civilians.” Without the Republican chaos, this would be the story on Capitol Hill, and this discord probably isn’t going away. The Trump H.R. Shadow Battle In preparation for a Republican nominee who is long on outrage and short on process, two shadow organizations—one staffed by ideologues, the other by the usual suspects—are competing to staff a putative second Trump administration with their own agendas in mind. What could possibly go wrong? TINA NGUYEN While the Republican establishment ostensibly wrestles over the obvious headaches of the day—defeating Biden in ’24, say, or praying that some House speaker candidate reaches 217 votes without totally humiliating the party—another political operation is taking place just out of sight. Or rather, two of them. Project 2025, a semi-secretive undertaking of the Heritage Foundation, and the America First Policy Institute, a collection of Trump administration all-stars and hangers-on, are already blueprinting and fantasy-drafting the future right-wing administration of their dreams. Whereas Heritage had started laying out the groundwork for Project 2025 two years ago to staff a “turnkey” operation for whichever Republican won the nomination—notably, they announced the Project’s existence at an event headlined by Ron DeSantis—AFPI was specifically built as a sinecure for Trump loyalists. “It’s basically the Trump administration in exile,” a conservative insider told me. As these two groups see it, the first Trump administration promised a dream scenario: a fame-loving president who was unusually politically malleable, and whose diehard fandom was as right-wing as it came. If there were any complaints from this crowd, it wasn’t the Muslim Ban or January 6 but rather that Trump and Trumpism were stymied and slow-rolled by recalcitrant bureaucrats and pesky civil servants. Naturally, now they want to replace them with a ready-on-day-one army of trained political appointees and a clearly-defined ideological action plan. “In 2017, on Inauguration Day, President Trump put about 500 people in the field. Fast forward four years later, on January 28, 2021, President Biden placed about 1,200,” said Doug Hoeschler, Trump’s former director of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Chair of AFPI’s Transition Project. “Biden signed 19 executive orders in the first 48 hours. And President Trump in the first 48 hours signed… one.” On some level, Project 2025 represents a conservative unity effort I’d long thought impossible. Just about every prominent right-wing organization I’ve followed over the past ten years—the pro-life groups and student activist armies; the Midwestern think tanks and right-wing magazines; the Tea Party Patriots, the Family Research Council, Stephen Miller’s legal firm, Moms for Liberty, you name it—has put aside their differences and are collaborating, a rare feat in an era where Republicans can’t even come together to pick a House Speaker. But of course, there had to be one exception: The America First Policy Institute, featuring the ghosts of Trumpworld past (Kellyanne Conway, Hogan Gidley, Larry Kudlow, Pam Bondi, Linda McMahon, Matt Whittaker, Chad Wolf, etcetera), which is dedicated to preserving and promoting the Trump Agenda. “It’s pretty much everyone except them,” a person familiar with Heritage’s efforts complained. “They’ve been invited, but they refuse to join.” On September 20, AFPI formally launched their own presidential transition project, focused on putting together their own personnel list of proposed appointees to staff the next administration, as well as their own list of proposed executive actions. “Preparing for the next America First administration is too much work for any one organization or even two,” Hoeschler told me. Both groups largely share the same goal of placing the “right people” inside the next administration, whether it’s under Trump or someone else (but let’s just say it’s Trump). But who precisely is on those shortlists is worth going to war over. Indeed, after several conversations with members of both Project 2025 and the AFPI Transition Project, it’s clear that neither has any plans to back down—although naturally, befitting the D.C. think tank scene, their sniping was genteel. (“We always wanted to avoid duplication of effort. We can realize synergy by working together,” Paul Dans, who leads Project 2025, told me. “We’re not entirely dismissive of other groups that are kind of doing their own transition efforts, [but] we had invited them into the coalition several times and they have declined.” Hoeschler, who leads the AFPI team, described it as a friendly rivalry. “I think us being in this space has put more pep in their step and vice versa,” he told me.) Yes, yes, sure. Inside the conservative movement, their conflict hasn’t gone unnoticed. “There’s definitely a rivalry between the two, because they’re dueling efforts,” a well-placed conservative insider summed it up to me. “They don’t see one another as complementary, they see them as competition.” A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSOR Your health insurance company and their pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) can steer you toward pharmacies that make them more money. How is that possible? Because they own the pharmacy, too. No one should stand between you and your medicine. See what else PBM middlemen are up to Right & Farther Right The Project 2025 and AFPI efforts primarily diverge over personnel and tactics, although there are ideological differences as well. “I wouldn’t say it’s super black and white, but Heritage is trying to be more conservative, whereas AFPI is specifically Trump policy,” the well-placed insider explained. “Is some of it conservative? Yes. Is some of it populist? Yes. Is it all Donald Trump? Yes.” One of Project 2025’s top priorities, for instance, is creating a resume database, full of recommended hires associated with the group’s various legacy conservative partners—not just Heritage, but also the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the Claremont Institute, the Conservative Partnership Institute, The Heartland Institute, Hillsdale College, the Leadership Institute, and at least two-dozen other influential nonprofits and think tanks. The coalition is also offering up academies to train these candidates on the inner workings of the federal bureaucracy. Perhaps most importantly, the group plans to have its work completed, its policy suggestions and personnel lists approved, well ahead of the 2024 presidential transition. “We wanted to deliver it two years ahead of time and bring it to the candidate, not the president-elect, and say, ‘this is where conservatives sit on an issue,’” Dans told me, adding that the president could sort out the “10 percent deviations” on his own. There are several Trump alumni in Project 2025 with experience in staffing the government—Dans, for instance, was Chief of Staff at the Office of Personnel Management—but its “secret weapon,” as the person familiar with Heritage’s efforts told me, is the presence of Johnny McEntee as senior advisor. McEntee started off as Trump’s body man and rose to become the director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, where he reportedly directed the federal agencies to purge career staff who were insufficiently loyal to Trump. “He was one of Trump’s closest confidants and still is,” this person told me. By contrast, the AFPI, which only launched in 2021, has roughly $14 million in the bank per their most recent tax filings —including a $1 million donation from Trump’s Save America PAC. Among certain ideologically-driven members of MAGAworld (the Steve Bannon types), it’s got a reputation as a waystation for establishment swamp creatures riding Trump’s coattails: 170 full-time and part-time policy team members, as well as 450-plus volunteers who were former senior administration officials or Trump allies, including the aforementioned Kellyanne, as well as Robert Lighthizer, Rick Perry, John Ratcliffe, and many more . That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as Marc Lotter, AFPI’s chief communications officer and the director of strategic communications for the Trump 2020 campaign, argued to me. “I think one of the tremendous benefits of this project is that you’re learning from former cabinet level officials and chiefs of staff, not just what needs to be done next,” he said. “It’s, here are the things that took us a year to learn, here’s where the embedded bureaucracy gummed up the works, here’s how they blocked action or slowed or delayed.” And, of course, on some level, it all boils down to money. “As with anything in D.C., there’s a fundraising component,” the well-placed insider told me. “They have to be in competition partially because they’re both trying to impress their donors, and they want to be able to tell their donors, well, if Trump were to win, we’d be ready to hit the ground with a whole host of staff and policy, and ours is the best—whether it’s Heritage or AFPI.” The Arms Race The anticipation and anxiety surrounding both group’s efforts are premised on a few shared theories of political change. First, that the president has broad executive authority to steer appointees to control and direct federal agencies—everything from the Department of Defense to the Postal Service. Second, that the Deep State “resistance” is real and must be purged. During the Trump administration, after all, appointees were continuously frustrated by leaks, legal filings, internal investigations, and other rules and regulations that preempted, slowed, or stopped their work entirely. (“One rogue bureaucrat is one too many,” said Hoeschler.) Both groups are also in agreement that the original sin of the Trump administration was its botched White House transition process. Part of the problem was the sheer chaos of it all—first it was Chris Christie in charge of the transition, then it was Jared Kushner. And of course the dysfunction hardly improved once Trump was sworn in, as competing cliques and agendas clashed inside the Oval Office (Reince Priebus vs Bannon vs Jivanka and the New Yorkers…). Constant staff turnover in the West Wing didn’t stop the knife-fighting either, and the Trump agenda was always at war with itself. All of which, arguably, could be laid at the feet of the president himself. Indeed, the abiding irony of the arms race between Project 2025 and AFPI is that for the millions of dollars and thousands of man-hours they are pouring into their individual initiatives, their efforts could all be rendered moot by the decision and whims of one man: the winner of the 2024 presidential election. Should that victor be the notoriously mercurial Trump, it’s hard to tell which organization would have the upper hand. There is plenty of character evidence to suggest he would ignore both of them. “I suspect he’s going to play footsie with both, and take names from both, and take policies from both and just kind of pick and choose,” the insider continued. “And he’s probably going to tell both of them you’re my guy. Because in the end, it’s all for him.” For now, both teams coexist under the aegis of Reagan’s 11th Commandment: Thou shall not speak ill of another conservative. (Dans specifically invoked it when I asked him about their entreaties to AFPI.) And both have acknowledged that it’s up to the president to decide which team to use, fully aware that it’s possible that he could use people from both. Either way, things could get ugly. “We got the 2016 transition wrong,” said the person familiar with Project 2025. “We let the establishment hijack it. This time we’re starting early and the true conservatives are gonna get it right and control it.” FOUR STORIES WE’RE TALKING ABOUT Israel Aid Paradox A close look at the Israel-Ukraine aid conundrum.

Then an eclectic array of academics, pastors, activists, social workers and blue-collar churchgoers exchange season’s greetings, thank God for bringing us together, and ask them to look after a sick family member. Today’s reading is a tough one: Marx’s Ecology: Materialism and Nature by John Bellamy Foster. Soon enough, discussion begins. There are knowing sighs at Marx condemning the conservative Christian idea that the world is a gift from God to interminably exploit. There’s also pushback: Should we readily agree with an avowed atheist who called religion a drug? Then there’s another prayer, this time for the then-upcoming Chicago mayoral election — everyone hopes God is on Brandon Johnson’s side — and a statement of hope about the environment. And that wraps this meeting of the ecology reading group of the Institute for Christian Socialism — a name the political Right would locate somewhere between oxymoron and heresy. The Institute for Christian Socialism (ICS), founded in the late 2010s by scholars and activists, is one of a growing number of left Christian organizations to emerge or be revived over the past decade, from radical Black churches to LGBTQ-affirming congregations.

""""""" We ’ ve seen hints that the Omicron wave could peak early and decline rapidly . In South Africa , that ’ s exactly what happened , but that was in a younger and less overweight population . The UK ’ s Omicron wave appeared to have begun a sharp decline last week . Is it our turn ? Last night , the Washington Post reported that the signs look good in major metropolitan areas , especially in New York City : The explosion of omicron cases along the Interstate 95 corridor from the Mid-Atlantic to New England is showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health officials and epidemiologists , offering reason for cautious optimism that the turning point could be near and that the coronavirus variant ’ s U.S. trajectory is similar to that of other countries . New York Gov .

Just how reliable are these test measures in an environment where few people can access tests , though ? The Omicron wave burned through the thin stock of tests that we do have , and now people are either taking a pass entirely on tests or flooding ERs to get to them , usually while either asymptomatic or with symptoms that don ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing gap this wide , can we really measure how far along the wave we truly are ? Actually , yes , albeit somewhat indirectly : Wastewater testing doesn ’ t get many headlines , but it has proven pretty good at picking up on trendlines before they appear in official statistics . Which in this case is comforting , because the CDC ’ s official data doesn ’ t suggest that we ’ ve hit the peak , especially with the limited testing available : There could be a number of reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ re still seeing cases climb nationwide while seeing a drop on the Atlantic seaboard . We are a large nation in both population and geography , and as we have seen in this pandemic , waves are best considered regionally . A dramatic drop on the Acela corridor would still be great news , since it has been the leading edge for COVID-19 waves , as it would portend short waves everywhere else . The New York Times ’ David Leonhardt calls for cautious optimism that we may see the light at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than expected . And with it , perhaps the emergence of a population that no longer has a novel immunity posture to COVID-19 : As Doron suggested , it ’ s too early to be confident that the Omicron wave has peaked even in areas with encouraging data — which tend to be the places where Omicron first arrived in the U.S . But there is good reason to consider that the most likely scenario . “ Looks like we may be cresting over that peak , ” Gov . Kathy Hochul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge surge in cases that lasts for about one month , followed by a rapid decline , would be consistent with the experience in some places where Omicron arrived earlier than in the U.S . In South Africa , new daily cases have fallen by about 70 percent from the mid-December peak . The chart showing South Africa ’ s recent trend looks like a skinny , upside-down letter V. In Britain , where pandemic trends have frequently been a few weeks ahead of those in the U.S. , cases peaked just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen somewhat … Still , the beginning of the end of the Omicron wave — if it turns out to be real — would be very good news . It would mean that a milder variant had become the dominant form of Covid but was no longer causing a surge in cases and overwhelming hospitals . It would mean that tens of millions of Americans had built up additional immunity , as a result of an Omicron infection . It would mean that the country would have taken a big step toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease like the flu , rather than a pandemic that dominates life . Leonhardt has done good work in covering COVID-19 rationally and realistically . This final point sounds like more wisdom .

That means most if not all Americans will come out the other side with some immune response regardless of vaccination status , with the vaccinated even stronger .

In the backstage area of the Trump rally that preceded the Capitol riot on Jan. 6 , 2021 , Hutchinson testified , the president was angry that the crowd wasn ’ t larger . “ He wanted it to be full and for people to not feel excluded because they had come far to watch him at the rally , and he felt the mags were at fault , ” Hutchinson , 26 , said in a taped interview , referring to magnetometers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vicinity of a conversation , where I heard the president say something to the effect of ‘ I don ’ t effing care if they have weapons . They are not here to hurt me , take the effing mags away . Let my people in . They can march to the Capitol from here , ’ ” Hutchinson said , quoting Trump . During live testimony , when Cheney asked whether Trump wanted to remove the metal detectors as long as no one was there to hurt him , Hutchinson responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment. ” Whether the Capitol rioters had weapons has been a point of contention for those assessing what happened that day . Although several persons were charged for having weapons on the Capitol grounds , which is prohibited by law , none was charged with having a weapon inside the building after it was breached by rioters . Before 10 a.m. on Jan. 6 , Hutchinson testified , White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato told Trump about reports from law enforcement on the scene that some of those on the Ellipse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spears , guns , and flag poles with spears at the top . She remembered that back at the White House , as the riots occurred , White House counsel Pat Cipollone told Meadows about the chants of “ Hang Mike Pence ” from Capitol rioters . “ You heard it , Pat , ” Meadows responded , according to Hutchinson . “ He thinks Mike deserves it . He thinks they aren ’ t doing anything wrong. ” After the live testimony and video presentation featuring Hutchinson , Cheney raised the specter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ testimony . “ I think most Americans know that attempting to influence witnesses to testify untruthfully presents very serious concerns , ” Cheney said . Cheney pointed to deposition excerpts from unnamed witnesses projected on the wall .

He knows you ’ re loyal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing when you go in for your deposition. ” The committee showed some of a recorded deposition from McEnany , who was Trump ’ s White House press secretary from April 2020 until the end of his presidency Jan. 20 , 2021 . “ When we got back to the White House [ after the rally ] , ” McEnany said in the deposition , Trump “ said he wanted to physically walk with the marchers . And according to my notes , he said he ’ d be fine with just riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s my recollection . He wanted to be part of the march [ to the Capitol ] in some fashion. ” The Beast is the nickname for the president ’ s armored limousine . However , Hutchinson told the committee that Cipollone , the Trump White House counsel , had told her on Jan. 6 , “ Please make sure we don ’ t go up to the Capitol , Cassidy. ” If Trump did so , she quoted Cipollone as saying , “ We ’ re going to get charged with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen. ” Hutchinson also told a dramatic story of Trump ’ s trying desperately to go to the Capitol despite the Secret Service ’ s concerns . She said that Ornato told her that Secret Service agent Bobby Angle , assigned to the president , was there . When Trump got into The Beast , he insisted to Angle that he wanted to go to the Capitol himself . “ When Bobby relayed to him , ‘ You ’ re not , we don ’ t have the assets to do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going back to the West Wing , ’ the president had a very strong , very angry response to that , ” Hutchinson testified . “ Tony described him as being irate. ” He said Ornato told her that Trump had reached for the Secret Servicc agent ’ s neck . Hutchinson said that on the day before , Jan. 5 , Meadows talked to former Trump campaign operative Roger Stone and Flynn , who served briefly as national security adviser . Both men were part of a “ war room ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile from the White House , to try to save Trump ’ s presidency . “ I wasn ’ t sure everything that was going on at the Willard Hotel , although I knew enough about what Mr. Giuliani and his associates were pushing during this period , ” Hutchinson said , adding : “ I didn ’ t think that it was something appropriate for the White House chief of staff to attend. ” Rudy Giuliani , former mayor of New York , is a close Trump adviser who has served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among speakers at the rally preceding the riot . During the hearing , the committee showed edited footage of Flynn ’ s deposition in which the retired Army lieutenant general repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination .

Hutchinson told the committee that Meadows and Giuliani both wanted presidential pardons from Trump after the riot . “ Ms .

"It is December 2015. I am the minister for flooding. (I am also the minister for forestry, for national parks, for nature, for chemicals, for air quality, for waste and recycling, for water and much more than can be written on a business card). I knew almost nothing about any of these topics when, six months earlier, the prime minister, David Cameron, made me minister for these things. It may have been a mistake. In a recent meeting he has given me the impression that he believes I am the minister for agriculture.

Yet to a small but influential gaggle of so-called “thought leaders” on the edge of the stage — the pseudo-intellectuals of right-wing think tanks, and chaos-agent-in-chief Steve Bannon — the growing rot infecting another key U.S. institution is just more evidence for their stunning argument now flying at warp speed, yet under the radar of a clueless mainstream media.",0

"Cicero, the Roman orator and politician of the first century B.C.E., spoke up over and over again—while stamping his feet for effect in between sentences, if his own testimony is to be believed—for the republic: that is, for a form of democratic government, perhaps limited, but unambiguously opposed to tyranny or boss-man rule. Supplying the rhetorical fuel, at least, for Julius Caesar’s assassination, he took up with some of Caesar’s successors, imagining them to be less autocratically inclined than the man they had assassinated. Before long, he found himself on the run from his new friends and was caught and killed by soldiers of the new regime. His head and hands were cut off and displayed in the forum where he had spoken, as a warning to others to be more discreet. His head was where his mouth was, of course, and his hands were an instrument of oratory, too; he was of a generation that believed in violent gesticulation while arguing, a form of communication now limited to football coaches protesting calls from the sidelines. And that was more or less that: reticence about the res publica ruled for a millennium and a half, with Cicero reduced to a master of the long and Latinate sentence. Then, just a couple of hundred years ago, a new set of republics was born, in Western Europe and America. Now, by general agreement, they are in crisis, too, having lasted only about half as long as the Roman original. Is the new crisis the result of cracks in the foundation of democracy, assaults on its principles, or the sudden appearance of a devil who scared away its better angels? Many recent books argue the various cases, and in each instance what you think will cure democracy depends on what you thought about it before it got sick. If liberal democracy (and how tightly those two words should be yoked together is among the subjects of contention) was a façade for the free market, then it is the neoliberal author of its own demise. If it was an essentially healthy, if imperfect, pluralist society, then it is beleaguered by enemies motivated by the sordid passions of mankind: nationalism, religious bigotry, xenophobia, and, above all, racial resentment. The basic solution that the writers of these books propose is to get more people to think about the problem the way they do. The trouble is that the whole point of liberal democratic regimes is to find solutions that involve people not thinking the way we do about a problem and somehow still existing, however grudgingly, as fellow-citizens. Against the urgent modernity of the crisis, the cures seem medieval—the political equivalent of cupping and blood-letting—in their vagueness and their very conditional promise.",0

"The pretext for impeaching Protasiewicz is that she won’t agree to recuse herself from redistricting cases, given her campaign comments about the state’s unfair maps, and the $10 million that the Democratic Party put into her race. This is, to put it mildly, a flimsy rationale. Wisconsin’s Judicial Commission has already dismissed a complaint that she violated court strictures by weighing in on contentious issues that might come before her as a judge. And the conservative majority on Wisconsin’s Supreme Court adopted a rule in 2009 that justices did not need to recuse themselves from hearing cases involving their campaign donors. If Republicans move ahead with this impeachment, it will be for one reason only: because they think they can. “Republicans feel deeply entitled to their gerrymandered majority,” said Charlie Sykes, once a powerful right-wing radio host in Wisconsin and now a founder of the Never Trump conservative publication The Bulwark. “For them, this is an existential issue.” Impeachment, which requires only a simple majority of the Assembly, may be easier for Republicans than removal, which requires a two-thirds vote in the State Senate. (Given the size of their Senate majority, they couldn’t afford to lose a single vote.) But some observers think that even if Republicans impeach Protasiewicz, they have no intention of actually holding a Senate trial. Once impeached, a justice is suspended from hearing cases while the process plays out. But since the state Constitution is silent on a timeline for that process, Republicans could impeach Protasiewicz and then leave her in legal oblivion indefinitely.",0

"A wealthy and well-connected anti-abortion group has gone to court to block the disclosure of its private donors following an investigation by openDemocracy and La Pública. It comes after a year-long effort by the two news organisations that reveals how three powerful anti-rights nonprofits in Chile are using legal loopholes to protect the identity of funders while influencing politicians to limit reproductive and equal rights for women and LGBTIQ communities. Two of the groups – Cuide Chile and the Organization for Research, Training and Women’s Studies (ISFEM) – have not declared any private donations at all in their tax returns. The other group – Chile Unido (United Chile) – has declared private donations, but not the source of them. So, earlier this year openDemocracy and La Pública asked Chile’s independent Transparency Council for Chile Unido’s donor information to be made public. The request was granted, but the country’s tax laws allow nonprofits and private foundations to keep donors’ names secret and Chile Unido is appealing the Transparency Council’s decision on those grounds.",0
"At a Sept. 30 fundraiser, San Francisco Democratic officials gathered in a ballroom at the Palace Hotel to raise a glass and look to the future. The smartly dressed, wine-sipping crowd gave roars of approval as San Francisco Democratic Party Chair Honey Mahogany, U.S. House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and a roster of top party and labor officials sent a clear message: The Democratic Party’s fight is a fight for civil rights, for working people and for democracy itself as Republicans seek to reinstall Donald Trump as president. But the message of unity belied a brewing fight over control of the local Democratic chapter as San Francisco faces multiple crises—including, in the eyes of many political and business leaders, a bad reputation.",0

"In 1938, German playwright and theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht talked about the Nazi regime in a conversation with his friend, the philosopher Walter Benjamin: “We must neglect nothing in our struggle against that lot. What they are planning is nothing small, make no mistake about it. They are planning for thirty thousand years ahead. Colossal things. Colossal crimes. They stop at nothing. They are out to destroy everything… That is why we too must think of everything.” Brecht was talking about his decision to include a set of poems for children in a collection related to fascism and war. In a year that marks Brecht’s 125th birth anniversary, his words carry a greater sense of immediacy for us in India, more than ever before, such are the striking parallels between the Germany of the 1920s-30s and present-day India. For, we too are facing a situation where the forces of majoritarianism are trying to destroy everything that has so far held this nation together and given it its distinct pluralistic identity.",0

This generation is two times more likely to struggle with emotional distress than the two generations that came before – Millennials and Generation X . Many of these mental struggles are based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . A majority ( 85 % ) openly admit that they are worried about the future in general . They worry about things like the economy , having enough money to survive , the environment , and the increasingly divided political landscape .

Much of the worry comes down to personal finances , as 90 % fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each month . Sixty-six percent of the respondents don ’ t feel financially stable at all . About half of the respondents don ’ t feel ready to join the workforce , and most are concerned about the future of the economy .

The very activities that bring people together , that promote community and achievement are replaced by a screen-driven life , dictated by algorithms and ads , where real knowledge is buried and propaganda is disseminated only to manipulate and control .

"When Stanford University physicists Steve Kivelson and Peter Michelson received word that the Agreement between the United States and China on Cooperation in Science and Technology might not be renewed just a week before its expiration in late August, they spent the weekend composing a strongly worded letter of objection to the Biden administration. They argued that the agreement, first signed in 1979 and renewed approximately every five years since, should not lapse. Instead every effort should be made to nurture open and transparent scientific cooperation. By August 27 they’d collected more than 1,000 endorsements from distinguished U.S. scientists. The urgency of their message reflects widespread outrage over scientific collaborations in fields ranging from physics to cancer research that were shattered by the Department of Justice’s four-year-long China Initiative, which officially ended in 2022. The initiative’s McCarthy-style bullying, aimed at disrupting research collaborations perceived as benefitting China at the expense of the U.S., cost hundreds of scientists their jobs and funding, wrecked dozens of productive research relationships and spread fear among valued Chinese collaborators. In 2021 thousands of Chinese scientists who previously would have remained at top U.S. research institutions left for China. These were “talented, idealistic and productive immigrants and visitors,” Kivelson told me. Failing to repair relations puts the U.S. in danger of what amounts to scientific “suicide,” according to the Guardian. U.S. scientists have lost access to advanced Chinese labs, massive data sets and teams of highly trained graduate students. Kivelson’s own field, quantum materials, he told Nature in August, “is highly dependent on and benefits from cooperation with colleagues in China.” Chinese colleagues sent their best students to Stanford. Once home in China, these students would attest to the freedom and richness of opportunities in the U.S. “That makes it that much harder for the Chinese Communist Party to portray the U.S. as a monolithically and ruthless adversary,” said Kivelson.",0
""""""" For a lot of long-term partners and married couples , it ’ s normal to lose that proverbial spark . Every couple eventually gets past the so-called honeymoon phase . And then realize real-life relationships are nothing like their favorite romantic movies after all . In the real world , relationships are less about sparks flying and more about keeping the fire burning . So Bright Side rounded up this love advice to help couples gain a renewed sense of appreciation for their significant others . Have you ever tried clocking how long you kiss your partner ? Dr. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute , suggests kissing your significant other for at least 6 seconds . The basic idea behind this is that 6 seconds encourages a more mindful kiss compared to , say , a split-second peck on the cheek . It is long enough to substantially connect with your partner physically , but not too long for you to miss the bus to work . It also builds appreciation and boosts fondness between you and your significant other . The concept of the Five Love Languages was created by counselor and pastor Dr. Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the 5 major ways we prefer to show our love , and how we want love to be shown to us in return . To help keep your partner happy , learning their preferred way of receiving love could work wonders in keeping that fire burning . See which of these love languages appeals to your partner the most : 3 . Use a special code that only you and your partner know . Aside from making you feel like a Secret Service agent ( which is always a cool idea ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples during uncomfortable moments . It can be something silly as saying “ guacamole ” to mean “ we have to leave , no questions asked. ” So , for instance , your partner wants to leave an event , they can just say “ guacamole ” and off you go to fetch the car . Another example , couples can also have a code for “ time-out ” which they can use in the middle of a heated argument . This kind of serves as an emergency brake . They can assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the time apart can give them space to blow off some steam and gain perspective . 4 . “ Can I help ? ” are 3 words that are more powerful than “ I love you. ” When you see your spouse folding the laundry , making dinner , or mowing the lawn , there ’ s nothing sweeter than lending them a helping hand . Not only does the job get done more quickly , but you score multiple brownie points for showing your partner how much you care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to housework , a couple can sit down and have a proper conversation about who ’ s responsible for what household chores . If your partner struggles with a particular task , understand what they are having difficulties with and make a compromise . Notice how sometimes conversations between long-time couples have simmered down to generic questions like , “ What ’ s for dinner ? ” or “ What time are you coming home ? ” A lot of couples get so caught up with their daily grind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful conversations with their significant other . Finding deeper topics to talk about not only fosters better communication but also allows partners to know more about one another . Need ideas ? You can find some topic suggestions here . It ’ s important to note that when your partner is venting to you , they do not necessarily need you to solve their problem . Most of the time , they just want you to listen . The emotional support you give through active listening is just as important , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fight the urge to always want to be the hero who solves your partner ’ s woes , and be the best friend who acknowledges their issues and reassures them that everything is going to be okay in the end . Spoiler alert . Marriage is not an endless world of exciting adventures . Couples are not always embarking on spontaneous trips , enjoying fun hobbies , or going on romantic dates . In fact , it ’ s quite the opposite . A lot of times , you find yourself quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same room and doing nothing particularly important .

"Australian Labor Party (ALP) Conferences used to mean something. They used to have a direct effect on the policies that leaders and politicians representing the labour movement took and implemented. Ideally, they were symbolic of the innately democratic nature of Australia’s largest worker’s party. Motions passed at your local branch could theoretically become policy if passed through all the chains necessary for it to arrive on conference floor. Factions had a strong social purpose: the Labor Left remained staunch in their commitment to the ideals of socialism, feminism, industrial action, environmentalism, nationalisation and anti-privatisation, land rights, the further democratisation of the Party and the movement, and so on. It was a chance to challenge not only the status quo of the Party, but if Labor was in government, it was a chance to actually challenge the status quo in Australia. Long gone are the days of Maoists and Leninists battling it out on the conference floor. Nowadays, ALP Conferences are pure theatre. All positions are decided on before the fact, via deals between factional heavies and politicians. There is no serious debate on most controversial issues, and votes are rarely taken further than by voice or by show of hands. The 2023 National Conference was no exception. While the grassroots sentiment of the Party has never been more characterised by disillusionment with the government’s policies, challenges mounted against these were more or less quashed.",0

Those closest to Trump have been deposed , portrayed or shown dismissing the former president ’ s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen . And yet the fight to thwart the will of the people continued unabated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Times The powerful testimony from a parade of Republicans , in four tightly produced hearings , has exposed in searing and consequential detail how divided the party has become between the faction that accepts the reality of the 2020 election and the many more who still cling to Trump ’ s anti-democratic falsehoods about a stolen election . “ If any Republicans were watching it , there is really no way they could defend a position that President Trump won the election based on the evidence presented so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting White House chief of staff to Trump . There have been brief video clips of the former president ’ s daughter Ivanka Trump and unsparing testimony from a top White House attorney , Eric Herschmann , who said he scolded another pro-Trump attorney as “ out of your ” mind for continuing to pursue conspiracies to stop Joe Biden ’ s inauguration even the day after the Capitol riot . “ We ’ ve got lots of theories , ” Rudy Giuliani , one of Trump ’ s lead lawyers , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to forestall the results , according to testimony Tuesday from Rusty Bowers , the Republican speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives . “ We just don ’ t have the evidence. ” The president ’ s former attorney general , William Barr , had one word for the swirling factless theories of fraud embraced by Trump in the election ’ s aftermath : “ bullshit. ” “ I told him that it was , it was crazy stuff , ” Barr said in his video deposition of claims of voting machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time on that , and it was doing grave , grave disservice to the country. ” But Mulvaney said that the partisan nature of the Democratic-led proceedings — the Republican leadership boycotted the panel after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi nixed some of its appointees — meant that fewer Republicans were likely to tune in . Democrats fully control the investigative committee , although its members include two anti-Trump Republicans , one of them Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming , the vice chair . “ The fact that there are Republican witnesses is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ I don ’ t think Bill Barr is lying . I also know I am not seeing his entire testimony . I am going to see the pieces of his testimony that the Democrats want me to see. ” On Tuesday , Bowers and two Republican officials from Georgia testified under oath , describing in harrowing terms the pressure campaign that they endured for standing up to the president and the toll that it took on them personally . On Thursday , more testimony is coming from inside the top ranks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The committee has been brilliant in that tactic of using senior officials , family members , those high up in the campaign and Republicans who supported him , ” said former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham , who served under Trump for almost his entire term but since emerged as a critic . “ That ’ s what gives me hope that it will break through. ” A new Quinnipiac University poll Wednesday suggested that such a breakthrough with large numbers of Republicans may still be a ways off . While nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears a lot or some responsibility for the events of Jan. 6 , the poll found , the opposite was true just among Republicans : 25 % said he bears “ not much ” responsibility and 44 % said he bears none at all . “ My level of hope that there is room for a sane wing of the Republican Party to become ascendant again — the chances of that are extremely low , ” said Sarah Longwell , a founder of the anti-Trump Republican Accountability Project . Still , in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has held since the hearings began , she said she noticed an unusual shift : Not one of the attendees wanted Trump to run in 2024 . “ What was interesting to me : They liked Trump , but they want to move on , ” Longwell said . “ Which is exactly how they talked about Jan. 6 in general. ” Cheney , Trump ’ s most prominent Republican critic in Congress , has been direct about her goal to try to drive a wedge between Trump and the party ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party ’ s elected leaders in Washington . “ I say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible : There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone , but your dishonor will remain , ” Cheney said at the first hearing June 9 . Cheney , who is facing a Trump-backed primary challenger this summer , has positioned herself as a potential presidential candidate against Trump should he run . Next week , she is slated to deliver a speech on the future of the party at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same venue where a number of ambitious , potential Republican contenders in 2024 have appeared in recent months . Several Republican strategists predicted the Jan. 6 committee hearings would have less of an effect on the 2022 midterms — when Trump himself is not on the ballot — than on the 2024 Republican presidential field . On Capitol Hill , few were as blunt about the threat posed by Trump as J. Michael Luttig , a former federal appeals court judge , who is hardly a household name but holds great stature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump and his allies and supporters are a clear and present danger to American democracy , ” Luttig said in testimony last week . Luttig then made the same forward-looking leap to the next presidential election that many Democrats are hoping voters will make as they vote in this fall ’ s midterms : If elected , Trump allies “ would attempt to overturn that 2024 election in the same way that they attempted to overturn the 2020 election , ” he warned . At times , the committee ’ s indictment has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so full of praise for the few Republicans who stood up to him , that some Democrats privately fear the strategy could backfire — by setting Trump apart from a Republican Party that , in fact , remains deeply loyal to him . “ It ’ s absolutely infuriating , ” said Jessica Post , executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee , which is involved in statehouse races . “ There is a much broader story than is being told by the Jan. 6 committee about the anti-democracy forces in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lionization of Bowers merely for upholding the law , noting that Arizona had passed more restrictive voting bills on his watch . “ I just don ’ t think you get a gold star for doing the absolutely least , ” Post said . Sitting next to Bowers on Tuesday was Georgia ’ s Republican secretary of state , Brad Raffensperger , who earned plaudits from the committee as a “ public servant. ” That same day , Georgia Democrats nominated a state representative , Bee Nguyen , to run against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raffensperger ’ s past support for greater restrictions on voting . The divide in the GOP can easily be overstated : Some of those whose words have been used as a cudgel against Trump still say they would vote for him in 2024 , should he be the nominee , including Barr and Bowers , who told The Associated Press this week , “ If he was up against Biden , I ’ d vote for him again. ” Another Republican whose courage has been hailed by the committee is former Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s intense pressure to overturn the election . Greg Jacob , Pence ’ s counsel , testified that one of Trump ’ s advisers , John Eastman , had asked Pence not to certify the Electoral College results even in the immediate aftermath of the Capitol riot . “ That ’ s rubber room stuff , ” Pence told him , as Jacob recalled . In other words , Jacob said , “ certifiably crazy. ” The committee ’ s hearing Thursday will be about Trump ’ s “ attempt to corrupt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Justice Department , to support his attempt to overturn the election , ” as Rep. Bennie Thompson , D-Miss. , the committee chair , previewed it . Three senior Trump administration alumni are lined up as the star witnesses : Jeffrey A.

"WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - With a possible partial government shutdown looming in two weeks, House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Sunday said he would bring a defense spending bill to a vote ""win or lose"" this week, despite resistance from hardline fellow Republicans. McCarthy is struggling to bring fiscal 2024 spending legislation to the House floor, with Republicans fractured by conservative demands for spending to be cut to a 2022 level of $1.47 trillion - $120 billion below the spending on which McCarthy agreed with Biden in May. Late on Sunday, members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus and the more moderate Main Street Caucus announced a deal on a short-term stopgap bill to keep the government open until October 31, but with a spending cut of more than 8% on agencies apart from the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. The measure, which is unlikely to become law, also includes conservative restrictions on immigration and the U.S. border with Mexico. It does not include funding for Ukraine, which Biden had requested.",0
""""""" In the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the federal government created a new Cabinet-level department , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , tasked with the mission of “ With honor and integrity , we will safeguard the American people , our homeland , and our values. ” One would assume that among the values DHS would safeguard would be Americans ’ fundamental right to freedom of speech , seeing as how it is integral to the American experiment . Yet , almost 20 years after its creation , it seems as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as concerned with safeguarding the American people and our values as it is with censoring the American people and running roughshod over our values via the creation of the Orwellian Disinformation Governance Board . On May 2 , DHS released a Fact Sheet titled “ DHS Internal Working Group Protects Free Speech and Other Fundamental Rights When Addressing Disinformation That Threatens the Security of the United States. ” “ The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is charged with safeguarding the United States against threats to its security , including threats exacerbated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that is deliberately spread with the intent to deceive or mislead , can take many forms … The Department is deeply committed to doing all of its work in a way that protects Americans ’ freedom of speech , civil rights , civil liberties , and privacy .

The working group also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagements on this subject with other federal agencies and a diverse range of external stakeholders. ” Pardon me , but I think that statement should be taken with a giant grain of salt . First , the DHS has a very sketchy record of “ safeguarding ” Americans ’ privacy . As the American Civil Liberties Union has documented , “ DHS intelligence analysts have unfairly targeted non-violent protest groups from all sides of the political spectrum for scrutiny over the last several years with inappropriate and factually flawed intelligence products. ” Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should not be regulated by the government whatsoever , let alone by the Department of Homeland Security , which already has its hands full given that terrorists , who present an actual threat to the homeland , are traversing our wide-open Southern border willy-nilly . Third , the person in charge of running DHS ’ Disinformation Governance Board , Nina Jankowicz , has quite the sordid history of disseminating disinformation herself . For example , Jankowicz was certain that the Hunter Biden laptop story was “ Russian disinformation. ” However , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , Jankowicz is on record as opposing free speech on social media platforms , especially after Elon Musk ’ s recent purchase of Twitter . According to Jankowicz , “ I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms , what that would look like for the marginalized communities. ” In a nutshell , that would look like the First Amendment in action . Surely , there are many more reasons to be wary of DHS ’ Disinformation Governance Board , especially since almost every government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creep . Instead of censoring Americans under the banner of “ disinformation , ” DHS should stick to its original mission of preventing terrorist attacks on the homeland and other calamities .

"“Extremism” has become a common term in political discourse, particularly since the 2016 election and the surrounding events. Most often used in reference to right-wing activists and agitators, it applies equally well to left-wing opponents of the same. One imagines as typical of “extremists” the circulating images of the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017, or of roving bands of black-clad “Antifa” protestors in the Pacific Northwest. Though “extremism” strikes many people as negative, with plentiful op-eds decrying its rise, there are perhaps equally plentiful defenders of the extremes to be found. Indeed, there are elected officials in the United States Congress who have been labeled as such, and essayists in major magazines regularly argue for various no-holds-barred political strategies as necessary to meet the challenges of our day. Against the proponents of extremism or radicalism of various sorts, enter Aurelian Craiutu. Taking the imaginative form of letters to two young, radical students, one on the right and one on the left, Craiutu’s new book Why Not Moderation? probes the value of moderation as both a personal and an institutional virtue. Building on his previous work on moderation in the history of political thought, Craiutu moves between interludes, which take the form of dialogues between himself and his radical students, and full-length letters on diverse topics such as the meaning of moderation, the difference between moderation and centrism, and the practical and applied nature of moderation. Craiutu takes great pains with the form of the work to convince his reader that he is not tilting at windmills, that there are real proponents of radical politics active today against whom he feels compelled to argue. His interlocutors defend these radical political strategies against his preferred politics of moderation not solely in their own words but in quotes Craiutu has pulled from contemporary public sources. Into his fictive students’ mouths, Craiutu places arguments sourced from The Jacobin, New Criterion, or from an assortment of scholars and activists who variously defend the destruction of property and the radical reformation of our political institutions in the pages of journals, magazines, newspapers, and blogs.",0

""""""" As workers at major companies increasingly move to unionize , the political environment for labor couldn ’ t be more ripe . Perhaps nowhere is that more accurate than at the National Labor Relations Board , the agency that enforces the country ’ s labor laws and oversees union elections . In the past year , the Biden-appointed top prosecutor Jennifer Abruzzo has been seeking to overturn precedent and revive decades-old labor policies that supporters say would make it easier for workers to form a union . To get her wish , Abruzzo must have buy-in from the five-member board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sympathetic to her proposed changes . As for President Joe Biden , he has vowed to be ” the most pro-union president ” in American history . “ In the past , there has been a focus on employer rights or employer interests . And I do not believe that comports with our congressional mandate , ” Abruzzo said in an interview with The Associated Press . The changes Abruzzo seeks come as workers at major companies , including Starbucks , Amazon and most recently , Apple , clinch union victories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s enforcement of labor law are likely to be reversed under a Republican administration and met with fierce resistance from employers in the federal courts . Currently , the agency is in the crosshairs of Amazon , which has been arguing in an NLRB hearing that began earlier this month that the union victory at one of its warehouses on Staten Island , New York , should be tossed out . The e-commerce giant claims labor organizers and the agency acted in a way that tainted the vote . In one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a lawsuit filed in March by the NLRB 's Brooklyn office seeking to reinstate a fired Amazon worker who was involved in the union drive . Abruzzo has said she would “ aggressively ” seek such remedies during her tenure , and could even pursue cases when an employer has only levied threats against workers . The agency has repeatedly taken Starbucks to federal court since December , most recently on Tuesday when it asked a court to reinstate seven employees in Buffalo , New York that it says were illegally fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abruzzo says she ’ s also been asking field offices to be on the lookout for other threats to workers . John Logan , the director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University , said some of the changes Abruzzo is seeking include policy shifts labor scholars have wanted for years . “ We have a general counsel prepared to do things that have not been done in the past , ” Logan said . “ And also doing it in the context of a period of labor organizing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decades. ” A career NLRB attorney for more than two decades , Abruzzo rose through the ranks of the agency to serve as deputy general counsel under former President Barack Obama . She briefly served as the acting general counsel and left the agency during the Trump administration for a stint at Communications Workers of America , one of the largest labor unions in the U.S. Last year , she was confirmed to her current role in the U.S. Senate along party lines . Arguably , her most significant move since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April , where she asked the labor board to reinstate Joy Silk , an arcane legal doctrine that could dramatically change how unions typically form in the U.S. Joy Silk , which was abandoned about 50 years ago , would compel companies to bargain with a union that secures majority support from workers through authorization cards rather than going through a protracted election process . Logan noted that Joy Silk essentially curtails an employers ' ability to wage long anti-union campaigns in the leadup to an election , when unions tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move towards Joy Silk is expected to be hotly contested by businesses and right-to-work groups who want private-ballot elections . Some experts say elections better capture how workers feel about a union . And the leadup to a vote typically gives companies time to make their case to workers as to why they should reject unionization , which is legal as long as employers follow labor law . However , labor activists and pro-union experts argue some employers use the time to fend off organizing by any means necessary , including mandatory meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons why workers should reject unionization . Though the labor board has allowed employers to mandate such meetings for decades , Abruzzo argued in an April memo that it was based on a misunderstanding of employers ’ speech rights and should be outlawed . She 's seeking to make the meetings voluntary for workers . Rep. Virginia Foxx , the Republican leader of the House Committee on Education and Labor , slammed Abruzzo 's memo soon after it was released , calling it “ a hyper-partisan love letter to unions. ” “ Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precedent and silence job creators , the consequences will be disastrous , ” Foxx said in a statement at the time . But field offices are following suit . About a month after Abruzzo ’ s memo was issued , the NLRB office in Brooklyn said it found merit in a charge filed by the Amazon Labor Union that accused Amazon of violating labor law at one of its warehouses on Staten Island , New York , by holding mandatory meetings to persuade workers to reject the union , adding further bad blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Mix , the president of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation , said it ’ s difficult to take Abruzzo ’ s quest for more workers ' rights seriously because she 's attempting to overturn a Trump labor board decision that made it easier for employers to suspend bargaining on a future contract when they know a union no longer has majority support . Abruzzo has signaled it ’ s one of the many decisions she intends to undo from the Trump era , when cases were spearheaded by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen by organized labor and Democrats as favoring employers . Biden later fired Robb . “ The hypocrisy is off the charts when you think about the employee rights , ” Mix said . “ When she gets done with the job , she ought to apply for the lobbyist job at the AFL-CIO , because she ’ s going even farther than union officials have even imagined. ” Experts say it ’ s too early to know how successful Abruzzo might be in her efforts because the changes she ’ s seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NLRB ’ s process . Logan , the labor expert , said she 's has been more aggressive than her Democrat-appointed predecessors , but still faces a steep challenge since changes she ’ s seeking are likely to be heavily litigated . “ Unfortunately , it ’ s not going to help workers right now , '' he said .

The city ’ s health official referenced above is one Ashwin Vasan , New York ’ s Health Commissioner . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing back vaccine passports . By now there is overwhelming evidence that the vaccine passport is useless as a means of fighting Covid infection for the simple reason that the vaccines do not work . The Covid vaccines prevent neither infection nor transmission . The evidence of this is all around us .

This writer knows at least ten fully vaccinated and boosted people who have come down with the virus after being multiply injected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them free of the virus . Do you remember when Joe Biden falsely claimed that the vaccines will keep us from getting Covid ? This is what Biden told us : “ You ’ re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations. ” Well , it was only a couple of weeks ago that his Vice President Kamala Harris announced that she tested positive for Covid . Kamala Harris has been fully vaccinated and twice boosted . Being a quadruple Covid injectee did nothing to keep her free of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony Blinken , Biden ’ s Secretary of State , announced that he also tested positive for Covid . Blinken is likewise fully vaccinated and boosted . But this is not the worst of it .

Look at this trend chart from Ontario , Canada posted by Steve Deace : This pattern is now being seen all over the world . According to the great Dr. Paul Alexander “ this mirrors the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boosted etc . is a problem ; it is driving infection and making people sick , with increased risk of hospital and death. ” In New Zealand nearly one hundred percent of Covid hospitalizations now occur among the vaccinated .

It goes without saying that the maleficent government led by the woke Jacinda Ardern is doing its best to conceal this terrible truth from New Zealand ’ s much abused and battered population . In the UK more than 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death are among the vaccinated . The situation is so dire that the UK government announced they will no longer make this data public . About this there can be no doubt : the vaccinated are more prone to Covid infection than the unvaccinated . What we now have is largely a pandemic of the vaccinated .

In other words , their immune system is unable to generate effective antibodies and they suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honest researchers are now increasingly suggesting that many of the vaccinated are now suffering from a form of immunodeficiency syndrome they call VAIDS . In light of this , how can any sane person suggest the idea of Covid vaccine passports ?

If anything , the bearers of such passports are more likely to be infected with the SARS-Cov-2 virus than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous injections . Who in their right mind , then , would bring up the possibility of vaccine passports at the time when we suffer from a pandemic of the vaccinated ? What exactly is going through the head of Ashwin Vasan and those like him ? Are they unaware of the data ? Are they unaware that the vaccinated are coming down with the virus en masse ? Mr. Vasan ’ s statements leave us with only two options : he is either an incompetent halfwit or worse , a malevolent totalitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the already badgered population . In any case , he should not be a public health official or hold any position of public trust .

Sadly , this kind of imbecility has become the norm in the last two years .

It does not matter that the vaccinated are getting widely infected ; let ’ s re-institute the completely useless vaccine passports anyway .

"Last month, American right-wing libertarian writer Richard Hanania’s past as pseudonymous 2010s alt-righter Richard Hoste was exposed in a hit piece. Hanania responded by disavowing his previous views, chronicling his journey away from the alt-right and towards “small-l liberalism”. Trump’s nativist rhetoric harmed him less with minorities than predicted Hanania remains vehemently anti-woke. Key to his current vision is the possibility of some sort of “multicultural based alliance”, where conservative immigrants join forces with conservative white Americans to oppose the woke ideals and policies advocated by white liberals. In a discussion with legal scholar Amy Wax, he argues that rural white Americans hate liberal elites more than they dislike being around immigrants. As immigrants have better (i.e. more socially conservative) values than native-born Americans, they should be encouraged not to assimilate.

""""""" As climate change makes natural disasters more frequent and severe — and threatens the viability of living in much of the country — Ian offered new evidence that Americans ’ retirement funds and assets are in jeopardy in vulnerable areas . “ This is an enormous wealth shock , ” said Benjamin Keys , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania ’ s Wharton School of Business , who has researched the effects of climate-driven sea-level rise on Florida ’ s housing market . The Federal Housing Finance Agency , which regulates the government-controlled companies behind about half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has begun assessing the risks that climate change poses to the mortgage and housing market . But it has historically allowed the Federal Emergency Management Agency ’ s flood insurance program to take the lead in protecting borrowers against flood damage — though independent analyses show that FEMA ’ s flood maps underestimate how many homes face flood danger . Home ownership is the primary way most Americans build wealth . For decades , federal policy has placed a priority on making more Americans homeowners , seeing it as the clearest way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But climate change is jeopardizing all that . The risks Ian revealed are most pressing for retirees . People over 65 years old make up 29 percent of the population in Lee County , Fla. — ground zero for Ian damage — according to Census data . Among midsize cities , business research firm AdvisorSmith found that the Lee County communities of Cape Coral and Fort Myers experienced the sixth- and seventh-greatest increases nationally in the numbers of people older than 65 years in 2019 . Those populations have grown even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of the Fort Myers and Cape Coral neighborhoods that Ian battered are middle-income , blue-collar areas , not at all like the multimillion-dollar mansions just down the coast in Naples , said Dave Stevens , a former CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association and Federal Housing Administration commissioner . They ’ re also hotbeds for retirees who had “ their life savings wrapped up in real estate ” and now live on a fixed income , he added . “ It ’ s an important asset — obviously not one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re part of the wealthy class , ” said Stevens , who is now CEO of consulting firm Mountain Lake Consulting . Retirees whose homes were destroyed also lost an important part of their wealth planning , said Jesse Keenan , professor of sustainable real estate at Tulane University ’ s School of Architecture . The market for reverse mortgages , which allow a person with a fully paid-off home to borrow against the house in exchange for cash , is “ very strong ” in Cape Coral , he said . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s no way to tap into that equity for everyday living . If these people already had a reverse mortgage , they ’ re likely using those funds to make repairs now — especially if they were uninsured , Keenan added . Climate science studies have shown that warmer temperatures are causing hurricanes to accelerate and grow stronger whenever they do form . Early analyses of Ian showed that human-driven climate change probably made the hurricane drop 10 percent more rainfall compared with a world without warming . That tracks with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which devastated the Houston area with more than 51 inches of rain when it stalled over the city for three days . Climate and natural disaster risk-modeling firm RMS estimated that Ian inflicted between $ 53 billion and $ 74 billion in private market insured losses , with a best estimate of $ 67 billion . That would make Ian the second-costliest hurricane in U.S. history , slotting behind Hurricane Katrina ’ s nearly $ 90 billion in insured losses in 2021 dollars , according to the Insurance Information Institute . Ian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion to $ 42 billion of insured damage from wind alone , without accounting for flooding damage , according to an estimate from CoreLogic , a property data and analytics company . Homes with federally backed mortgages in the 100-year floodplain are required to carry flood insurance , but that covers only up to $ 250,000 . In contrast , the average mortgage borrower in the area covering Cape Coral and Fort Myers has $ 316,499 of equity in their homes , according to CoreLogic . Boosting flood insurance would buttress homeowners against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep current with legal requirements to purchase that protection — a subject that ’ s been part of congressional inquiries and Government Accountability Office reports . And FEMA , despite administering the federal flood insurance program , maintains it does not have the ability to enforce those requirements .

And even homes outside the 100-year floodplain , where this insurance is not required , incur flood damage . In Lee County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the national average , but still reached only 30 percent of households , according to FEMA data . “ Issues related to flood insurance are convoluted and frustrating , and Hurricane Ian has brought these matters to the forefront , which the State will likely address soon , ” Donalds said in his emailed statement . Even people who have insurance must spend up to their deductibles before their claims are covered , which can be difficult for retirees on fixed incomes . “ For retirees it ’ s a double whammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes with cash , and even if they ’ re in the flood zone they don ’ t have coverage because the [ National Flood Insurance Program ] enforces through mortgages , ” said Tom Larsen , associate vice president for hazard and risk management at CoreLogic . “ Flood damage can go from zero to a very high number very rapidly , ” he said .

""""""" Known for its tree-lined streets and Spanish mission-style architecture , the city of Mission Viejo—located in the Saddleback Valley east of Laguna Beach—is the largest master-planned neighborhood in California . Though Mission Viejo can trace its origins back to the 19th century , it is relatively young , becoming incorporated just 34 years ago . The delay of cityhood , historians say , was due to the region ’ s craggy landscape , which builders deemed “ undevelopable ” as late as the 1960s . However , with the right developers , Mission Viejo transformed from a hilly cattle ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93,000 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2020 . In 1845 , Spanish rancher Don Juan Forster purchased 23,000 acres of property—then called Rancho Mission Viejo—that would become the modern-day city . Because the region ’ s hills made it difficult to farm , it was largely used by Forster as cattle and sheep grazing fields . Forster would go on to purchase Rancho Trabuco , Mission San Juan Capistrano , and Rancho Santa Margarita . His holdings totaled nearly 200,000 acres at the time of his death in 1882 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California at the time . After Forster ’ s death , Irish immigrants Richard O ’ Neill Sr. and James Flood purchased Forster ’ s property , with Flood putting his money upfront and O ’ Neill paying half of his share through labor by working the land .

Both Flood and O ’ Neill deeded their halves of the ranch to their respective sons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then called the Santa Margarita Company—but both men died shortly after , and the company was dissolved in 1939 when the family ’ s descendants split the property in two . The O ’ Neill family kept the northern portion of the ranch located in modern-day Orange County , while the Flood family took the southern portion of the ranch , which is now part of San Diego County . In 1942 , the United States Marine Corps bought the entire San Diego portion—totaling 123,620 acres—for $ 4.2 million to expand Camp Pendleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family began to build their portion of the property , beginning with the 278-acre O ’ Neill Regional Park in 1950 . Led by O ’ Neill ’ s eldest grandson Anthony Moiso , the family established the Mission Viejo Company in 1963 and commenced its first residential development—the 11,000-acre planned community of Mission Viejo—alongside Donald Bren , a small Orange County developer who would later become the president of the company . The company hired Jim Toepfer—formerly Santa Ana ’ s director of planning—as the vice president of planning , Frank Fehse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of engineering , and Philip Reilly as its corporate attorney . Reilly became the next president of the company shortly after , and Bren went on to purchase the Irvine Company , which was originally founded by the Irvine family and known for its master planning of the namesake city .

Lodder , now 88 , told The Epoch Times that Reilly , in his many public presentations , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice stew . “ If one of the key ingredients is missing , the stew will not taste so well , ” Lodder said , quoting Reilly . Ultimately , the company utilized many new building techniques and built a city that worked with the region ’ s complex landscape , building streets in the valleys and homes in the hills . “ Other developers who had evaluated … the development did not see the opportunity that slowly started to become real … under the leadership of Reilly , ” Lodder said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the houses were in such high demand , he said , that people used to camp out for weeks to purchase the home they had their eye on .

""""""" The pro-LBGT British leader added that he ’ s ‘ immensely sympathetic ’ to people ‘ who want to change gender , ’ however , and noted that he strongly opposes therapy for same-sex attraction . LONDON ( LifeSiteNews ) – On April 6 , U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the heated debate over the transgender movement ’ s societal takeover , stating bluntly that biological males should be barred from female sporting events and noting his view that parents should have some say in whether their children are put on the path to “ transition ” —a now-controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get between children and parents . The comments came as the Tories are split over a so-called “ conversion therapy ban ” —Johnson has stated that this ban should not include transgender people , while some backbenchers and Scottish Tories vehemently disagree . “ I don ’ t think that it ’ s reasonable for kids to be deemed so-called Gillick-competent to take decisions about their gender or irreversible treatments that they might have , ” Johnson stated during a visit to a hospital in Welwyn Garden City . “ I think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very least . I don ’ t think that biological men should be competing in female sporting events . We will have a ban on gay conversion therapy , which to me is utterly abhorrent . But there are complexities and sensitivities when you move from the areas of sexuality to the question of gender . There , I ’ m afraid , there are things that I think still need to be worked out. ” Johnson , who has frequently backtracked on his commitments to protect female-only spaces and has vacillated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still working through his position . “ That ’ s as far as my thinking has developed on this issue , ” he noted . “ If that puts me in conflict with some others , then we have got to work it all out .

It ’ s vital that we give people the maximum possible love and support in making those decisions . But these are complex issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be solved with one swift , easy piece of legislation . It takes a lot of thought to get this right. ” However , many politicians who support the transgender agenda are falsely accusing Johnson of backing “ conversion therapy ” for “ transgender children. ” Labour MP Angela Rayner called Johnson a “ liability , ” while homosexual Tory MP Elliot Colburn called the comments “ a massive own goal ” ; the Scottish Tory “ gender reform spokesperson ” Meghan Gallacher stated that : “ As our manifesto for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are in favor of a ban on the abhorrent practice of conversion therapy. ” Wales says it may bring in its own ban ; Scotland may do the same , rejecting a cautious approach that would closely examine a hotly contested issue . Those condemning Johnson ’ s caution almost universally ignore the reality that many children are being subjected to lifelong medicalization after taking “ treatments ” that cause irreversible damage—an issue that is still working its way through the U.K. courts . They also refuse to address the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports rather than compete against biological males , as well as horror stories of male sex criminals being locked up in female prisons—and promptly reoffending . Politicians backing the transgender movement are presenting the issue as eminently simple , rejecting the Health Secretary ’ s comments that “ when it comes to trans , I do think we need to be more careful. ” The Health Secretary noted that a report authored by Dr. Hilary Cass called for caution . “ She talked about how children and young people , when they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right for medical experts to be able to question that and determine what the cause might be . Is it a genuine case of gender identity dysphoria , or could it be that the individual is suffering from child sex abuse , for example , or could it be linked to bullying ? ” Prior studies have noted that almost 80 percent of children eventually grow out of gender dysphoria . The “ conversion therapy ban ” as written could prevent therapists from actually helping gender dysphoric children become comfortable in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kearns repulsively accused the Johnson government of targeting transgender people : “ What makes trans people deserve to be abused ? That ’ s the [ question ] to every person supporting this decision. ” Jacob Rees-Mogg , the Brexit Opportunities Minister and a devout Catholic , cut through the noise with a simple statement : “ I think , as often , the Bible gives the best answer to this : Genesis 127 . ‘ God made man in His own image .

"It’s no accident that Boebert’s profile in her home state these days is diverging from the Freedom Caucus rabble-rouser she’s known as on the Hill. After squeaking through a recount to a second term last fall against Democrat Adam Frisch — Boebert won by just 546 votes — it became clear that her rhetorical bomb-throwing was wearing on GOP voters. Boebert is hardly the only member projecting a different version of herself in the Capitol than she does back home. But her embrace of a political split personality illustrates the limits of raucous Trump-first conservatism in a competitive district. Her Freedom Caucus stardom hasn’t immunized her from the risk of playing more to the GOP base than voters back home.

""""""" There is widespread agreement among most of the Republican political establishment : If former Gov . Eric Greitens wins the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate , their control of a relatively safe seat could be in jeopardy . But even as he polls well in the race , national Republicans haven ’ t figured out what to do about it . Through most of the Republican primary Greitens ’ opponents have been critical but didn ’ t spend substantial money attacking his campaign . After Greitens posted a fundraising video proclaiming that it was open season for hunting members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke . In the aftermath of the video , Missouri donors launched a super PAC with the intention of going after Greitens . A former staffer for U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt ’ s 2016 campaign began highlighting negative publicity about Greitens to reporters . A former staffer of U.S. Sen. John Danforth entered the Senate race as an independent candidate . But even as Missouri ’ s Republican political establishment began to coalesce against Greitens , top Senate Republican leaders in the Capitol have stayed quiet . U.S. Sen. Rick Scott , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senatorial Committee , has said he will not get involved in the primary to prevent Greitens from winning , consistent with what has long been the policy of the Senate ’ s top campaign arm . U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky – whose vast political machine has marshaled resources to block candidates he deems unelectable since 2014 – has made no indication he would get involved . The two have been hands-off even as Greitens has portrayed any opposition or criticism of his campaign as the dark machinations of Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to questions about whether he would be able to win a general election . His defiant embrace of victimhood has muddied the political calculation for national Republicans as they try to determine whether , or how much , to intervene in a race Greitens isn ’ t guaranteed to win . Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley , who has called on Greitens to drop out of the race and endorsed U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler , wouldn ’ t say whether he wanted national Republicans to become more involved in the race . “ I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , but I ’ ll just say that I ’ m doing everything I can to try to make sure that Vicky Hartzler can get her message out , ” Hawley said . “ And then also people hear the truth about , particularly , the former governor. ” Former President Donald Trump said this weekend that he would not be endorsing Hartzler for U.S. Senate , despite Hawley ’ s support for her candidacy . Scott , the NRSC chairman , reiterated recently that he didn ’ t plan to intervene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought whichever candidates emerged on top would go on to win the general election . “ I ’ m not getting involved in any open primaries , ” Scott said during a question-and-answer session with reporters in June . “ I think Missouri would make a good choice . And I think whoever they choose is going to be a Republican senator from Missouri. ” When he spoke with reporters last month , Scott said that he hadn ’ t yet seen Greitens ’ infamous web-only ad ( it had been released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate “ ought to ever be promoting any violence. ” It ’ s not the first time Scott has offered tacit criticism of Greitens . In March , the Florida Republican called the allegations that Greitens abused his ex-wife and son “ pretty disturbing , ” but he ’ s still stopped short of calling him to exit the race . Scott , who grew up in North Kansas City , acknowledges that he doesn ’ t think an intervention from a GOP leader does much to sway voter opinion , based in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen years ago , the then-political neophyte took on an establishment-backed Republican , Bill McCollum , in the state ’ s gubernatorial primary , winning what was once considered a long-shot bid . “ In 2010 , I had no endorsements , ” he said . “ I was completely new . And the voters , I went and explained why I should be the new governor , and I was able to sell a message . So … whether it ’ s Eric Schmitt , or Vicky Hartzler , or Billy Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is going to have the best message for voters. ” Scott has frustrated some national Republicans since becoming NRSC chair , releasing his own controversial policy agenda earlier this year that drew a rebuke from Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell and others in the party . Scott later released a revised version of the agenda . Republicans who know the Florida senator say they think he ’ s keenly aware that injecting himself into a primary will not only fail to change the dynamic of the race , it ’ ll risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is widely seen among national Republicans as positioning himself for a future presidential race , though he has reiterated lately he ’ s focused only on the 2022 midterms and then his own re-election in 2024 . “ It ’ s difficult for any Republican to get involved unless they have a lot of gravitas that extends beyond their home state and DC , and Rick has ambitions beyond this , ” said one conservative strategist , familiar with the dynamic . “ Injecting himself in a hot primary risks hindering him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , has not been afraid to get involved in a primary when he believes it will risk his chances to win the U.S. Senate . McConnell wrote in his memoir The Long Game that after candidates associated with the Tea Party won in 2012 and subsequently lost general elections – like former Rep. Todd Akin in Missouri – he no longer believed any challenge should be discounted . In 2020 , McConnell ’ s Senate Leadership Fund spent more than $ 3 million in Kansas running ads attacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had recently lost a gubernatorial election in the state . The group , called the Plains PAC , started spending money late in the campaign , after the Federal Elections Commission ’ s June deadline to report its donors . The group targeted Kobach ’ s ties to white nationalists , helping to lift U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall to a 14-point victory . So far in Missouri , it appears McConnell and his PAC have avoided stepping into the race . When asked about Greitens in the U.S. Capitol , McConnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Missourians to decide whether or not to elect him . That hasn ’ t stopped Greitens from accusing McConnell of trying to tip the scales . After being accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife in March , Greitens quickly claimed that the allegations were orchestrated by political strategists associated with McConnell . The connection was thin – Sheena Greitens sister worked for someone who had previously worked with and praised McConnell – but Greitens attorneys attempted to subpoena phone records in order to prove his claim ( thus far , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . He also quickly accused McConnell of being behind a super PAC formed to attack Greitens , called “ Show Me Values. ” While the group is not revealing all of its donors , one of them is Missouri investor Rex Sinquefield , who has spent more than $ 1 million on a PAC backing Attorney General Eric Schmitt in the U.S. Senate race . Sinquefield is a highly sought after Missouri Republican mega-donor who founded the Show-Me Institute , a group that urges politicians to cut taxes . Instead of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greitens instead highlighted the fact that the St. Louis businessman had previously donated to McConnell , saying it was evidence that McConnell was trying to block him from getting to the Senate . Already , the group has spent more than $ 2 million attacking Greitens , including around $ 1 million boosting an ad quoting Sheena Greitens domestic violence claims . It shows quotes from Sheena Greitens ’ March affidavit in which she said she was concerned for her safety and the safety of her children before saying , “ That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greitens has continued to blame McConnell for the attacks . “ The lies keep coming from my RINO opponents & Mitch McConnell ’ s top allies , ” Greitens wrote on Twitter Friday . “ They only attack the ones they fear . ” """"""",0
"The district, drawn after the 2020 census, divided communities in Charleston County, placing key suburbs under the purview of Representative Jim Clyburn, the sole Democrat in the South Carolina congressional delegation. Roughly 30,000 Black voters were moved out of the 1st district and into Clyburn’s. In January, after a case was brought by the South Carolina chapter of the NAACP and a Black voter, three federal judges found that the gerrymander amounted to “bleaching” the district and racially discriminated against Black voters. The judges determined that, in order to create a solid Republican district, GOP legislators drew the district to keep the Black voting-age population at around 17 percent, and ordered a redraw of the map. The court wrote that reducing the percentage of Black voters “was no easy task and was effectively impossible without the gerrymandering of the African American population of Charleston County.” This case is personal for Moore, who is a descendant of Robert Smalls, one of the first Black congressmen to serve after the Civil War. There is some symmetry in the history—Smalls was elected to a different district in the mid-1880s after his seat was gerrymandered. Moore is quick to note that he is “fighting a very similar fight” to his grandfather, roughly 150 years later. “There is a lot about what’s happening now in the country that, for those of us who are attuned to history and have a sense about Reconstruction, at least gives us pause and concern about where we are,” Moore told me in an interview, hours after he spoke at a rally in front of the Supreme Court.",0

Critics say the camp is spiraling out of control . Neighbors and business owners are complaining about a surge in property crimes and retail theft in the area connected to the camp . “ We have number of pictures and videos of them coming on to our property , stealing stuff from our porch our back yard , ” says neighbor Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people here are from Spokane , city officials say a crush of homeless are also moving in from outside the city , including sex-offenders and felons with active warrants . “ We ’ ve had a number of domestic violence , assaults , rapes , ” says Fire Chief Brian Schaeffer .

After the city warned of an impending clearing , everyone moved their tents to the WSDOT property . “ This camp has more services provided to it than every shelter in this town .

Instead pointing me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesperson declined an on-camera interview , but sent me a statement that reads in part , “ We do not have law enforcement authority or services .

Camp Hope organizers says the vast majority of campers are willing to take pallet shelters if the city or state would give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outskirts of the city . According to Spokane County ’ s Point-in-Time Count released in May , there are 1,757 homeless people in Spokane County — up 13 % in the past two years .

"Republicans have effectively had unbreakable control of the Wisconsin state legislature for more than a decade. And now they have a plan that could entrench their rule forever. The state’s legislature is so aggressively gerrymandered that it is likely impossible for Republicans to lose control of it in an election. In 2018, for example, Democratic state assembly candidates received 54 percent of the popular vote in Wisconsin, but Republicans still won 63 of the assembly’s 99 seats. There is, however, a light at the end of this tunnel both for small-d democrats and for large-D Democrats in the notoriously contentious swing state. Last April, Justice Janet Protasiewicz won a landslide election victory over a former, very conservative state justice. She took her seat at the beginning of August, giving Democrats a 4-3 majority on the state supreme court.

If these discontented were to change their opinion, his favorability would be near or above 50%. Depressed Democrats hold down his standing. Biden returns from the G20 economic conference in India triumphant, conducting complex diplomacy edging out China, and heralding a host of deliverables, notably a deal to build a rail and shipping network from India to Europe and the Middle East, running through Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel, a “game-changing regional investment”, he declares. He follows with an unprecedented pact with Vietnam as a strategic partner. Then at his press conference he wanders into a monologue about a John Wayne western and one of Biden’s favored expressions, “a lying dog-faced pony soldier”, to refer to disbelievers in the climate crisis. Biden gets no credit for his accomplishments. The Axios newsletter reports that he and Trump “are running dueling basement campaigns that make them look like they are in the witness protection program”. Actual events and policies are dismissed. The formulaic repetition of false equivalence, put forward as “balance”, prevails as conventional wisdom.",0
""""""" Almost certainly not , although it ’ s also not likely the point of the lawsuit in the first place . Donald Trump added to his legal issues yesterday by taking the offensive against CNN in a defamation claim , alleging that the network compared him to Adolf Hitler and specifically defamed him as an “ insurrectionist. ” Presumably MSNBC and some print outlets will be next , depending on how this goes : Former President Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against CNN and teased that more legal battles against other media outlets will follow . “ CNN has sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ‘ trusted ’ news source—to defame the Plaintiff in the minds of its viewers and readers for the purpose of defeating him politically , culminating in CNN claiming credit for ‘ [ getting ] Trump out ’ in the 2020 presidential election , ” the lawsuit filed Monday alleged . “ CNN ’ s campaign of dissuasion in the form of libel and slander against the Plaintiff has only escalated in recent months as CNN fears the Plaintiff will run for president in 2024 . As a part of its concerted effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left , CNN has tried to taint the Plaintiff with a series of ever-more scandalous , false , and defamatory labels of ‘ racist , ’ ‘ Russian lackey , ’ ‘ insurrectionist , ’ and ultimately ‘ Hitler. ’ ” “ These labels are neither hyperbolic nor opinion : these are repeatedly reported as true fact , with purported factual support , by allegedly ‘ reputable ’ newscasters , acting not merely with reckless disregard for the truth of their statements… but acting with real animosity for the Plaintiff and seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit continued . … “ The ‘ Big Lie ’ is a direct reference to a tactic employed by Adolf Hitler and appearing in Hitler ’ s Mein Kampf . As commonly understood : ‘ If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it , people will eventually come to believe it. ’ The ‘ Big Lie ’ was used by Hitler to incite hatred of the Jews and to convince people to ostracize Jewish people . It was an entire propaganda campaign to justify Jewish persecution and genocide . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bandied about blithely . CNN anchors and commentators understand this . They have not used it against other political leaders and previously criticized political analogies to Nazi Germany and to Hitler , ” the lawsuit claims . Ironically , this came within the same week that Trump referred to New York Times reporter/author Maggie Haberman as “ Maggot , ” called Mitch McConnell ’ s wife Elaine Chao “ China-loving ” and “ Coco Chow ” on his Truth Social platform ( Chao is from Taiwan ) , and also suggested McConnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not following his advice . For the last seven years or more , Trump has also referred to media outlets such as CNN as “ the enemy of the people ” and “ fake news ” too . There is a strong element of a dishing-out/taking-it imbalance in a sudden desire for remedies for defamation . But those were opinions , Trump and his team will likely argue , and some might even agree with some of those . True — Trump is giving his opinions , but then again , so too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the claim in the lawsuit , almost all of these alleged offenses comes from CNN ’ s commentary or analysis , and even those from whatever “ straight news ” functions CNN has is almost certainly not actionable . Why ? For one thing , Trump is a “ public person ” in relation to Sullivan . In fact , he might be one of the most self-promoting “ public persons ” in recent American history . He has promoted himself in so many ventures that it ’ s almost laughable to suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that distinguishes him from Nick Sandmann , who did win a defamation case against CNN for their lies about the incident at the March for Life several years ago . Sandmann was not only not a public person before then , CNN made him a public figure of derision against his will over false allegations of racism . More importantly , Trump is also a public figure — a politician and a former office holder , one who admittedly in the complaint itself is considering a return to office in the near future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Sullivan , that is a separate category that carries the same actual-malice standard and perhaps even a higher bar in proving it . That adds to the protection of reporting , commentary , and analysis , as Jonathan Turley explains this morning , although it does not constitute an absolute defense for respondents in such a suit : The public figure standard was established in Curtis Publishing v. Butts ( 1967 ) . The case involved a March 23 , 1963 edition of The Saturday Evening Post alleging that former University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Alabama coach Paul “ Bear ” Bryant to fix a 1962 football game in Alabama ’ s favor . In a 5-4 decision , Chief Justice Warren wrote a concurrence that extended the ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan on public officials to public figures . He found the same reasons for applying the higher standard to public officials as present in cases involving public figures … The Court ruled in favor of Butts , and The Saturday Evening Post was ordered to pay $ 3.06 million ( later reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damages . That case , however , involved a specific allegation of a fixed game , not hyperbolic or partisan rhetoric . Notably , Curtis was decided joined with Associated Press v. Walker , involving former Gen. Edwin Walker who opposed desegregation . In one article , the Associated Press claimed that Walker had “ led a charge of students against federal marshals ” and “ commanded ” those opposing the admission of James Meredith at the University of Mississippi . He prevailed at trial . However , the Court found that AP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard , even as a matter of reckless disregard . Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote for himself and three other justices ( and joined by concurring justices ) in noting that Walker was a “ public figure , ” given the fact that “ his personal activity amount [ ed ] to a thrusting of his personality into the ‘ vortex ’ of an important public controversy. ” Harlan also noted that Walker “ commanded sufficient access to the means of counterargument to be able to expose through discussion the falsehood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harlan concluded , should only follow “ a showing of highly unreasonable conduct constituting an extreme departure from the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers. ” Consider just how often Trump has “ thrust [ ] his personality into the ‘ vortex ' ” of various controversies , and you start to get the picture of how difficult a job his attorneys now have . It didn ’ t get any easier with Trump ’ s personal attacks on McConnell , Chao , and Haberman either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression of a public figure who baits the media into this kind of coverage and confrontation . Calling Chao “ China-loving ” while at the same time complaining about “ Big Lie ” accusations is not likely to impress a court when this gets a hearing , and you can bet that CNN ’ s attorneys will have binders full of Trump ’ s hyperbolic accusations when it comes time to argue this — if it gets that far at all . This looks like a publicity stunt , not a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for Trump ’ s PR team to make it look like Trump ’ s going over to the offensive on the legal front and perhaps distracting a bit from his legal woes with the Department of Justice and Letitia James , who herself appears to be more on a PR campaign than a serious exercise of her job . Filing it now makes it also a distraction for the GOP and a possible division point just a few weeks before voters can punish Democrats for their incompetence and corruption in the midterm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican voters to consider after the midterms , when they will need to decide what kind of leadership they want in future elections — leadership focused on collective victory , or on personal grievances of their leader .

""""""" ( Natural News ) Western democracies in Europe are continuing to collapse under the insane ‘ woke ’ cultural influence of the far-left , as noted in a report by constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley on his website . The George Washington University Law School academic noted that while Finland was recently once again rated as “ the happiest place to live , ” it ’ s not the place to be if you value freedom of speech , noting that a major free speech case is percolating there following the filing of criminal charges against Member of Parliament and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ‘ crime ’ ? Quoting the Bible to voice her opposition to her church ’ s sponsorship of an LGBTQ “ pride ” event . The 61-year-old MP is now reportedly facing up to two years behind bars for simply exercising her free speech and freedom of religion rights . On June 17 , 2019 , Räsänen asked in a Twitter post how the sponsorship was compatible with the Bible , linking to a photograph of a biblical passage , Romans 1:24-27 , on Instagram . She also posted the text and image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted that “ The purpose [ of ] my tweet was in no way to insult sexual minorities . My criticism was aimed at the leadership of the church. ” The Prosecutor General charged Räsänen with incitement against a minority group , arguing that her statements were “ likely to cause intolerance , contempt , and hatred towards homosexuals. ” But Räsänen has not backed down , standing firm on her rights to freedom of speech . “ I can not accept that voicing my religious beliefs could mean imprisonment . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slandering , or insulting anyone . My statements were all based on the Bible ’ s teachings on marriage and sexuality , ” she said . “ I will defend my right to confess my faith , so that no one else would be deprived of their right to freedom of religion and speech , ” she continued . “ I hold on to the view that my expressions are legal and they should not be censored . I will not back down from my views . I will not be intimidated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep silent on controversial themes , the narrower the space for freedom of speech gets , ” Räsänen adds . In his assessment of this outrage , Turley noted that throughout Western governments , especially in France , there has been an “ alarming rollback ” of speech rights , mostly under the guise of ‘ combatting hate speech ’ and ‘ non-discrimination laws , ’ both of which are really just used by the woke , intolerant left to silence criticism of aberrant lifestyles . He noted earlier that he wrote about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bardot after she said in 2006 that Muslims were ruining her country in a letter to Nicolas Sarkozy , then-Interior Minister and later France ’ s president . “ Bardot , an animal rights activist , has been repeatedly hit with such criminal complaints for criticizing different groups . Now she was later fined for calling the inhabitants of La Reunion ‘ savages ’ for their continued sacrificing of animals in religious rituals , ” Turley wrote . And though he said that he disagreed with Räsänen ’ s views on homosexuality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liberal second he also disagrees with Finland ’ s persecution of her simply for holding a certain viewpoint . “ I happen to disagree with her views on homosexuality but that is immaterial . Many of us in the free speech community view this as a human right to be able to express one ’ s values and beliefs without threat of arrest . In the name of equity , Finland is sacrificing liberty . In the name of tolerance , Finland is declaring intolerance for opposing views , ” Turley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leftists engage in when shutting down the speech of conservatives . “ No such tradeoff is necessary . Political opponents can respond to what they view as bad speech with better speech , ” he continued . “ In the free expression of ideas , people can reach their own conclusions and better viewpoints can prevail . Instead , in cases like the one involving Räsänen , critics are seeking to silence those with opposing viewpoints . It is a new orthodoxy imposed on dissenting views — the same state-supported intolerance that once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advocates for LGBT rights , ” Turley adds . If our country ’ s liberal academics were truly liberal in the historic sense , they would all echo Turley ’ s views : You can disagree with someone else ’ s opinion but in a free society you can ’ t be allowed to persecute them for it .

""""""" While Russia deals with increasing losses on the battlefield , gradually increasing sanctions have created their own pressure since the invasion of Ukraine began on February 24 of this year . Led by the United States and European Union , sanctions on Russia ’ s massive energy sector have forced the Russian economy to replace losses from the European market with both legal and illicit energy sales . In the US , President Joe Biden issued an executive order prohibiting the import of Russian petroleum products , liquid natural gas ( LNG ) , and coal products as of March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a far larger market for Russian energy , will cease importing most Russian crude oil in December , and will stop importing refined Russian petroleum products two months later . Overall , crude oil exports via cargo vessel trended downward in May , June , and July , with China , India , and Italy the top destinations for Russian crude oil , according to data from vessel trade analysis firm KPLER . During the first half of September , seaborne shipments of Russian crude oil continued to fall , by 314,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting exports via ship at the lowest levels since the start of the war , according to S & P Global Insights . However , petroleum isn ’ t the only energy source Russia produces , and the US and EU aren ’ t the only markets for those products . Petroleum shipments are still relatively stable for Russia , as nations like China and India have picked up some slack from EU countries weaning themselves off oil , and Russia still has LNG , coal , and nuclear energy to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to make petroleum products more appealing to customers like India and Indonesia , Russia has offered fairly steep discounts — an average of $ 30 per barrel — against Brent crude oil , which has also been a benefit for Sri Lanka , Pakistan , Bangladesh , and Cuba , all emerging economies struggling with inflation , as Business Insider reported . Although according to S & P the discounts on Russian crude oil are decreasing , some analysts believe they ’ ll persist , making Russian crude oil imports highly palatable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Russian shipments arrived [ to Sri Lanka ] from Primorsk and Novorossiysk , ports located in the Baltic Sea and Black Sea , respectively , ” Thanh-Long Huynh , chief executive of the data analytics firm QuantCube , told the Financial Times . “ Since these ports historically served European ports , they indicate the development of new trade routes for Russian energy. ” Countries like China , India , and Turkey are proving eager partners for the Russian fuel industry , with Turkey doubling Russian oil imports this year and vying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfers into Europe after damage to the Nord Stream pipelines . Between April and July , China — the world ’ s top energy consumer and biggest customer for crude oil — had purchased 17 percent more Russian crude oil than it had during the same period in 2021 , according to Reuters . And despite major discounts , the price of oil is still much higher than it was in 2020 , pre-coronavirus , allowing Russia to bring in more money from oil exports even though production is down , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think tank Geopolitical Intelligence Services . The Russian energy market is bigger than just oil EU countries have struggled to disentangle themselves from Russian fuel overall , not just oil . Russian natural gas , pumped through avenues like the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which was damaged in September , provided about 40 percent of Europe ’ s natural gas prior to the invasion , according to Reuters . But even as Europe tries to turn away from Russian gas flows , investing in Norwegian fuel instead , Russian LNG is finding its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Javier Blas wrote in Bloomberg earlier this week . Even with the Nord Stream 1 pipeline out of commission — and setting aside the transfers to China , now Russia ’ s biggest natural gas buyer — European countries are importing record amounts of Russian LNG at market prices , according to Bloomberg . France has purchased about 6 percent more Russian LNG between January and September of this year than it did all of last year ; Spain has already broken its record for Russian LNG imports this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . The stakes for natural gas imports are somewhat different than they are for Russian petroleum , in a number of different ways ; for one , the EU hasn ’ t imposed sanctions against it as it has against petroleum products , though the bloc does intend to eliminate its reliance on Russian fossil fuels by 2027 . Second , Russia has already used Europe ‘ s reliance on its natural gas as a weapon ; Russia cut access to many European countries which refused to pay for LNG in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe by 60 percent in June and by 80 percent in July , Reuters reported last month . Asian markets , too , are in on the game ; by July of this year , China ’ s Russian energy imports overall had grown 7 percent over 2019 , according to Chinese customs data analyzed by Reuters . Between April and July , China purchased 50 percent more LNG and 6 percent more coal from Russia than it had during the same period in 2021 , lured at least in part by lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue ; in a deal negotiated in February , China will get a new natural gas pipeline from Russia . India , also , has become a major buyer of Russian energy , particularly oil , though in prior years it rarely imported Russian crude . Low Russian crude oil prices drove Indian purchases to a peak of 950,000 barrels per day in June , but price increases have since pushed that number down to about 477,000 barrels per day in September . India also picked up slack for Russia ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian coal took effect on August 10 . That ban halted all coal shipments to the bloc after a four-month tapering period , and also prevents EU-based insurers and financial firms from working with Russian coal exports , as Bloomberg reported at the time . That makes exporting Russian coal extremely difficult , since most financial institutions and insurance companies involved in global shipping are based in the EU , the UK , and Switzerland . Though Russia is one of the world ’ s major coal exporters , with about 17 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for only about one percent of Russia ’ s economy . Even though customers like India and China are importing large amounts at high prices , coal exports simply can ’ t make a significant dent in Russia ’ s economy . Overall , Russia ’ s earned about 158 billion euros from fossil fuel sales from February to September , according to a report from the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air ; half of that , about 85 billion euros , came from EU purchases . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpassed 100 billion euros — about 260 million euros per day — although CREA saw Russian exports dropping in September and Russia ’ s revenue from fossil fuel exports decreasing by about 14 percent . Globally , Russian revenues from fossil fuels were down 300 million euros per day in September compared to February and March of this year , according to CREA . While fossil fuels get more attention , Russia is also a market leader on nuclear energy . Russian nuclear technology , as well as fuel , has thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as CNBC reported Friday , despite calls from Ukraine to impose such restrictions . Russia continues to invest heavily in its nuclear technology , and nuclear facilities in many nations are dependent on Russian technology and cooperation to function , even if they ’ re not directly importing Russian nuclear fuel , according to a report by Robert Ichord for the Atlantic Council . Russia has developed and borrowed methods of sanctions evasion Not all of Russia ’ s energy exports are easily discernible ; Russia has several illicit strategies to evade western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . Because these transactions are , by their nature , often difficult to track , it ’ s hard to know how effective and how widespread they are — not to mention how much the Russian economy is benefiting from them . “ As a general matter , I think that the most widespread sanctions evasion technique is for sanctioned Russian businesses to hide behind front companies that are not sanctioned and/or to conduct transactions through third party countries that do not present sanctions issues , ” Thomas Firestone , co-chair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan , told Vox via email . That can cause problems for companies doing business with such firms , causing them to perhaps unwittingly do business with sanctioned entities . Russia has plenty of models on which to base illicit shipping transactions ; according to a July article in the journal Strategic Comment , Iran developed methods like “ multiple ship-to-ship transfers , temporarily disabling vessel-tracking transponders and using obscure sailing patterns ” to hide shipments of its oil . Ships also have “ complex ownership structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or often sail under flags of countries with lax adherence to the rule of law , to obscure their origin with a lower chance of pushback . Some Russian tankers are reportedly shipping under the flags of St. Kitts and Nevis and the Marshall Islands . According to Umbach ’ s research , “ more Russian oil tankers ship without a reported destination , ” with Russian state-owned shipping firm Sovcomflot declining to supply end-point information for one-third of its fleet in April , according to Strategic Comment . According to the Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil were shipped that way in April , up from almost zero prior to the invasion . Without a set destination , the oil can undergo a ship-to-ship transfer to obscure its origins . Another tactic sanctioned countries — now , including Russia — have used to obscure the origins of their petroleum products is to blend it with oil from other countries , “ passing it off as Latvian or other foreign blends ” like Lithuanian or Turkmenistani , according to Umbach . Royal Dutch Shell transported oil under this scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the company was obligated to do so under previous contracts , and that because the blend contained only 49.99 percent Russian oil , the whole product was no longer of Russian origin . Shell later promised to cease accepting refined oil with any Russian petroleum , and said it would continue with a planned phase-out of all Russian crude products . As Russia becomes further estranged from the global market , these methods will only become more pronounced and more common , as they have in other sanctioned states like Iran and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s war machine and the revenue it generates even more difficult to track .

Instead of making the schools safer , government officials are making them more authoritarian . Instead of raising up a generation of civic-minded citizens with critical thinking skills , government officials are churning out compliant drones who know little to nothing about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being taught the three R ’ s of education ( reading , writing and arithmetic ) , young people are being drilled in the three I ’ s of life in the American police state : indoctrination , intimidation and intolerance . From the moment a child enters one of the nation ’ s 98,000 public schools to the moment he or she graduates , they will be exposed to a steady diet of : • politically correct mindsets that teach young people to censor themselves and those around them , • @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coupled with the rest , acclimate young people to a world in which they have no freedom of thought , speech or movement . Roped into the government ’ s profit-driven campaign to keep the nation “ safe ” from drugs , disease , and weapons , the schools have transformed themselves into quasi-prisons , complete with surveillance cameras , metal detectors , police patrols , zero tolerance policies , lock downs , drug sniffing dogs , strip searches and active shooter drills . Young people in America are now first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spied on , threatened , tied up , locked down , treated like criminals for non-criminal behavior , tasered and in some cases shot . Students are not only punished for minor transgressions such as playing cops and robbers on the playground , bringing LEGOs to school , or having a food fight , but the punishments have become far more severe , shifting from detention and visits to the principal ’ s office into misdemeanor tickets , juvenile court , handcuffs , tasers and even prison terms . Students have been suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school “ look alike substances ” such as oregano , breath mints , birth control pills and powdered sugar . Look-alike weapons ( toy guns—even Lego-sized ones , hand-drawn pictures of guns , pencils twirled in a “ threatening ” manner , imaginary bows and arrows , fingers positioned like guns ) can also land a student in hot water , in some cases getting them expelled from school or charged with a crime . Not even good deeds go unpunished . One 13-year-old was given detention for exposing the school to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a hungry friend . A third grader was suspended for shaving her head in sympathy for a friend who had lost her hair to chemotherapy . And then there was the high school senior who was suspended for saying “ bless you ” after a fellow classmate sneezed . Having police in the schools only adds to the danger . Thanks to a combination of media hype , political pandering and financial incentives , the use of armed police officers ( a.k.a . school resource officers ) to patrol school hallways has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbine school shooting . Indeed , the growing presence of police in the nation ’ s schools is resulting in greater police “ involvement in routine discipline matters that principals and parents used to address without involvement from law enforcement officers. ” Funded by the U.S. Department of Justice , these school resource officers have become de facto wardens in elementary , middle and high schools , doling out their own brand of justice to the so-called “ criminals ” in their midst with the help of tasers , pepper spray , batons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of school-appropriate guidelines , police are more and more “ stepping in to deal with minor rulebreaking : sagging pants , disrespectful comments , brief physical skirmishes . What previously might have resulted in a detention or a visit to the principal ’ s office was replaced with excruciating pain and temporary blindness , often followed by a trip to the courthouse. ” Not even the younger , elementary school-aged kids are being spared these “ hardening ” tactics . On any given day when school is in session , kids who “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facedown on the floor , locked in dark closets , tied up with straps , bungee cords and duct tape , handcuffed , leg shackled , tasered or otherwise restrained , immobilized or placed in solitary confinement in order to bring them under “ control. ” In almost every case , these undeniably harsh methods are used to punish kids—some as young as 4 and 5 years old—for simply failing to follow directions or throwing tantrums . Very rarely do the kids pose any credible danger to themselves or others . Unbelievably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least when employed by school officials or school resource officers in the nation ’ s public schools . This is what happens when you introduce police and police tactics into the schools . Paradoxically , by the time you add in the lockdowns and active shooter drills , instead of making the schools safer , school officials have succeeded in creating an environment in which children are so traumatized that they suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder , nightmares , anxiety , mistrust of adults in authority , as well as feelings of anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delusion . For example , a middle school in Washington State went on lockdown after a student brought a toy gun to class . A Boston high school went into lockdown for four hours after a bullet was discovered in a classroom . A North Carolina elementary school locked down and called in police after a fifth grader reported seeing an unfamiliar man in the school ( it turned out to be a parent ) . Police officers at a Florida middle school carried out an active shooter drill in an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event of an actual shooting crisis . Two armed officers , guns loaded and drawn , burst into classrooms , terrorizing the students and placing the school into lockdown mode . These police state tactics have not made the schools any safer . The fallout has been what you ’ d expect , with the nation ’ s young people treated like hardened criminals : handcuffed , arrested , tasered , tackled and taught the painful lesson that the Constitution ( especially the Fourth Amendment ) doesn ’ t mean much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s the answer , not only for the here-and-now—the children growing up in these quasi-prisons—but for the future of this country ? How do you convince a child who has been routinely handcuffed , shackled , tied down , locked up , and immobilized by government officials—all before he reaches the age of adulthood—that he has any rights at all , let alone the right to challenge wrongdoing , resist oppression and defend himself against injustice ? Most of all , how do you persuade a fellow American that the government works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his young life , he has been incarcerated in an institution that teaches young people to be obedient and compliant citizens who don ’ t talk back , don ’ t question and don ’ t challenge authority ? As we ’ ve seen with other issues , any significant reforms will have to start locally and trickle upwards . For starters , parents need to be vocal , visible and organized and demand that school officials 1 ) adopt a policy of positive reinforcement in dealing with behavior issues ; 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police officers and cease involving them in student discipline ; and 3 ) insist that all behavioral issues be addressed first and foremost with a child ’ s parents , before any other disciplinary tactics are attempted . As I make clear in my book Battlefield America : The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries , if we want to raise up a generation of freedom fighters who will actually operate with justice , fairness , accountability and equality towards each other and their government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools like freedom forums .

"(Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story attributed a quote in the last paragraph to Alice Rolli instead of Freddie.) There are two ways to foreshadow how things will go down Thursday night when Nashville’s aeonic mayoral election saga finally streams its series finale. Most likely is the conventional wisdom prediction (it’s not called conventional for nothing): progressive, experienced politico running a generally safe, amply funded, mistake-free campaign takes down conservative Republican political amateur, and with plenty of room to spare. Less conventionally wise is the big honkin’ upset: the conservative persuades a very large number of Davidson County Trump voters who had zero interest in her campaign in the general election five weeks ago to gin up enough interest in her now to show up for a runoff.",0
"Israeli paper of record Haaretz found little difficulty in identifying the deeper causes of Hamas’s merciless October 7 attack on southern Israel. It cited Benjamin Netanyahu’s responsibility for the war, including the long campaign to strangle Gaza. But faced with the atrocities against Israeli civilians — and despite the dire conditions in a bombarded Gaza now facing a likely ground invasion — this level of nuance is increasingly inaudible in Western Europe. In France, as elsewhere, even politicians who do squarely condemn Hamas’s attack are under scrutiny. Any attempt to invoke context — Israeli raids on the West Bank, occupation, a sixteen-year blockade on Gaza — is cited as an attempt to justify terrorism. This has been particularly true of France’s leading left-wing force, La France Insoumise (LFI), whose initial statements about the crisis had them accused of providing “apologias” for terrorism. Its leader in the National Assembly, Mathilde Panot, faced particular criticism for referring to Hamas’s attack as “war crimes” and not “terrorism” — a word which, she explained, did not permit a serious “thinking through” of the years of occupation and colonization of Palestine. This statement came days after an LFI press release on October 7 alluded to the attack by Hamas — which the European Union officially designates as a terrorist organization — as an “armed offensive.” From President Emmanuel Macron to Marine Le Pen, the Israel-Hamas war is an opportunity to attack and delegitimize the left-wing opposition at home. Both ministers and the far-right Rassemblement National have in the past derided LFI as “Islamo-leftist,” and it is again now tarred with this brush. “The positions of France Insoumise are well-known,” Macron’s prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, lamented in an interview on BFM-TV, lambasting an “anti-Zionism” that, she says, often approaches “antisemitism.”",0

This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanitarian tragedy unfolding every single day , created solely and exclusively by 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and the president of the United States . Continuing , Miller argued that while the border state governors are doing the best they can , the current situation is a bad one that he contended had no historical precedent .

This is sex trafficking . Little girls , little boys , are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to be talking about this. ” Miller then emphasized what he thinks needs to be done , saying that the legislature should have to do , calling for a vote on handling the border and saying that those allowing the crisis to happen have earned “ eternal infamy ” for letting such bloodthirsty evildoers control the border . “ We need to be saying to Chuck Schumer , you ’ re not going adjourn the Senate . You need to stay here and we ’ re going to vote…The American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a referendum on this evil , grave immorality playing out every single day on our border , that when you ’ re going to vote , you ’ re voting on whether or not we allow murderers , raging , bloodthirsty criminal cartels to be in control of 2,000 miles of our sovereign border . “ Because you know what , if we don ’ t elect a new majority to shut this thing down , then this evil will only worsen and multiply and history will record , with the greatest astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Now , Trump has responded . He went nuclear in an interview with Fox News Digital , pledging to not “ partake ” in the investigation . “ I have been going through this for six years — for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I am not going to go through it anymore , ” Trump said . “ And I hope the Republicans have the courage to fight this. ” “ I am not going to partake in it , ” Trump added . “ I ’ m not going to partake in this. ” The former president on Tuesday had formally announced he is mounting another White House campaign for 2024 . “ I have never heard of such a thing .

After all , the conflicts of interest that exist regarding Merrick Garland and the DOJ , given their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed before last Tuesday . To wait until Trump had announced is plainly political , meant to put in place a mechanism that will likely haunt the former president right up until the 2024 general election ( if he wins the nomination ) .

No one wants the former president to be the nominee in 2024 more than Democrats and Joe Biden . They want the foil , and whether they are correct or not , they believe he ’ s infinitely beatable .

"Why bother with fiction? That’s one question. Why bother with history? That’s another. And they’ve both been torturing Zadie Smith, who has now produced the sort of fiction she once dismissed as “aesthetically and politically conservative by definition” — a historical novel. But apparently her years teaching in the United States persuaded her what fans of the genre (among whose number I include myself) have long known: “Not all historical fiction cosplays its era, and an exploration of the past need not be a slavish imitation of it. You can come at the past from an interrogative angle, or a sly remove, and some historical fiction will radically transform your perspective not just on the past but on the present.” As a form however, historical fiction is bristling with risks. Most saliently, anachronisms — to be pointed out by pedantic readers. The exemplar in such matters is Charles Dickens. A draft of his first historical novel, Barnaby Rudge (1841), contained a minor character who was hanged “for passing bad one pound notes”. A correspondent who had seen the proofs wrote to inform him that it was only after 1797 that notes under five pounds were issued; Barnaby Rudge was set in the lead-up to the Gordon Riots of 1780. Dickens checked, assented, and replied to this Victorian pedant, wishing him: “Very many thanks… for your kind care.” (It’s noteworthy not just that he was grateful but that he took care to double-check first.)

But new reporting shows that Masters can ’ t seem to quit promoting Thiel businesses on the campaign trail—and that Thiel or Masters can ’ t seem to stop making questionable in-kind contributions . Masters announced last month that he had left his top positions at two organizations named after Thiel , who has poured more than $ 10 million of support into the Senate bid . But a Daily Beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax records reveals that Masters appears still far from severing his shared interests with his mentor . Brendan Fischer , deputy executive director at Documented , told The Daily Beast that the facts demonstrate an inextricable connection . “ This further underscores how Masters ’ candidacy is almost inseparable from its billionaire backer , ” Fischer said . “ Thiel helped launch Masters ’ career , dumped $ 10 million into a super PAC backing Masters , appeared with Masters at a Club for Growth donor summit , and is deeply and personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign. ” “ I ’ m struggling to think of another example of a politician who would owe so much of their success to a single person , ” he concluded . Jordan Libowitz , communications director at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , expressed a similar sentiment . “ It does seem to present at a minimum an optics issue , because it appears Masters is using his campaign to promote his biggest financial backer . A campaign can ’ t be run for anyone ’ s personal benefit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has never sought political office and hails from the West Coast world of tech capital investment . Almost all of his adult life has been tied in some way to Thiel , a billionaire Facebook investor and former board member Masters met while studying at Stanford Law School . Today , Masters is running on a hard-right , pro-Trump , anti-institutional , MAGA-libertarian platform , with the gaps in that ideology filled in with election fraud rhetoric and anti-immigrant red meat , and finished with a sprinkling of technocratic autonomy . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is largely a reflection of Thiel ’ s own distinctive political blend , and largely mirrors another thirtysomething Thiel protégé-cum-Senate hopeful : J.D . Vance . ( Thiel has reportedly brought Masters and Vance to meet Trump , though the ex-president still hasn ’ t coughed up an endorsement in either of their races . ) Masters , who officially launched his bid last July—months after Thiel threw $ 10 million into a super PAC supporting him—says he fully intends to win the Arizona GOP primary this August . But even with Thiel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have flagged , though he topped the field in a recent survey funded by the Thiel super PAC . Still , Masters didn ’ t appear to have his substantial conflicts of interest squared away when he entered the fray .

It apparently took another five months to finalize that resignation . The Secret Meeting Between Mark Zuckerberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the meantime , Masters repeatedly used the platform of his candidacy to shill for his own financial interests , as well as those of his then-boss—a pattern that has extended to campaign fundraising . Those interests have included major Thiel-backed corporations . The two largest , Palantir and Anduril , do billions of dollars of business with the federal government . Masters plugged both of them in a New York Post interview kicking off his candidacy last July .

Very often it ’ s just like you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless them—they have a huge territory , and they just have like a radio and a sidearm or something like that . We should be using drones .

Likewise , the report noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immigration and Customs Enforcement , which include software . Masters has also proselytized the online alternative video platform Rumble , saying in a February interview , “ We invested in Rumble , which I think is a really good company. ” On March 11 , days before announcing his exit from the Thiel groups , Masters went on Fox News ’ most viewed show and pumped another Thiel investment , an alternative search engine called “ Brave. ” It was , in fact , the first question that the show ’ s host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , addressing so-called privacy concerns surrounding other search engines .

Five days later , Masters announced he ’ d left the Thiel entities . That day , Puck News reported Thiel was hosting another fundraiser to support Masters , at least the fourth such event so far .

Seems like Arizona voters would want to know where that $ 4.3 million ended up , ” Fischer said . “ Did the Foundation secretly finance groups that worked to overturn the 2020 election , for example ? ” Donors Trust funneled millions of dollars to a number of far-right entities in 2020 , including groups that tried to overturn the election results ( which Masters and the Thiel-backed super PAC have also questioned ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( One of Donors Trust ’ s white supremacist beneficiaries , VDARE , celebrated Masters in August as an “ immigration patriot. ” ) Returning to Masters ’ personal financial disclosure , Thiel Capital plays a dual role . It also happens to be the entity that compensates Masters hundreds of thousands of dollars for book sales . That arrangement is notable , because Zero to One has in recent months become the keystone for Masters ’ political fundraising efforts . Masters and Thiel co-authored Zero to One in 2014 , based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d heard Thiel give at Stanford . But Masters ’ financial disclosure doesn ’ t indicate that he gets royalties , per se , and it doesn ’ t show an agreement with the book ’ s publisher , Crown Publishing . Additionally , Thiel is the sole copyright holder . The Masters campaign has regularly promoted Zero to One , saying the 2014 collection of Thiel ’ s 2012 lectures articulates Masters ’ vision for America ’ s future . Since December , his campaign has held two NFT sweepstakes connected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donors an array of Thiel-adjacent prizes , including hardcover copies signed and personalized by both co-authors . Experts say those giveaways raise questions of their own . “ The NFT piece is interesting to me because it is an example of auctioning off access not only to Masters , but to Thiel , ” said Fischer . “ It is common to sell access to politicians , far less common to sell access to the politician plus their benefactor. ” Additionally , the 99 books from the first giveaway don ’ t appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s unclear how the campaign got them . Libowitz , of CREW , said that while such giveaways are commonplace , the books “ should show up as an in-kind contribution or an expenditure , ” depending on whether they were donated or purchased . “ As long as they ’ re paying fair market value for the book , that ’ s totally fine . It gets into this nefarious area when it ’ s a question of whether it directs money to candidate. ” Thiel Crony Publicly Disses Best Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conditions say royalties from book sales will go to the pro-gun groups Firearms Policy Coalition and the Second Amendment Foundation , it ’ s not immediately clear that Masters—who doesn ’ t report any book royalty income , but apparently secondary payments from Thiel—has authority to make the decision . It ’ s also unclear from the terms whether Thiel had also agreed to donate the royalties that he would collect from those sales , or whether he would still benefit , however marginally , from the promotion . What is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign benefitted . The first giveaway , which asked for $ 5,800 max donations , sold out in three days and raised more than $ 550,000—though the campaign didn ’ t see the full value of those 99 donations thanks to a cryptocurrency crash that struck during the sweepstakes and devalued some contributions . Still , the promotion was so successful that the campaign launched a second , this one offering new NFTs in “ packs ” at a range of buy-in points . Some of the NFTs will be more rare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra perks for collecting the rare ones—unsurprisingly , those perks include signed copies of Zero to One , as well as access to Thiel , in the form of a private dinner . The page spills a great deal of digital ink hyping those prizes , which it pegs in value between $ 10 and $ 2,250 . The top prize includes the private dinner in Los Angeles with Masters and Thiel ( with $ 2,000 travel stipend ) , a line in the book ’ s acknowledgments section in future printings ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handmade physical copy of the original book , and “ VIP access to any ZtO parties. ” Without the stipend , the retail value is pegged at $ 250 . “ This is sort of similar to the Kayne 2020 campaign selling merch that went for inflated prices on the secondary market , ” he noted , adding that there was another intrinsic value— “ the opportunity to have dinner with Peter Thiel is a big incentive for tech donors. ” It ’ s unclear whether Masters thinks his donors will see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn ’ t appear to harbor any real intention of even giving away the major prizes . The campaign says that it will mint an NFT grab bag of a maximum 20,000 NFTs , to be distributed sometime between now and July , a month before Masters faces his test in the primary election .

""""""" Losing a parent may be one of the most destabilizing events of the human experience . Orphans are at increased risk of substance abuse , dropping out of school , and poverty . They are almost twice as likely as non-orphans to die by suicide , and they remain more susceptible to almost every major cause of death for the rest of their life . Because of the pandemic , some 200,000 American children now face these stark odds . Even after two years that have inured the country to the carnage of the coronavirus , the scope of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hard to comprehend : Caregiver loss during the pandemic is now responsible for one out of every 12 orphans under the age of 18 , and in every public school in the United States , on average two children have lost a caregiver to the pandemic .

It is a steadily rising slope , and the summit is still out of sight , ” Susan Hillis , the co-chair of the Global Reference Group on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . “ It ’ s not like you ’ re an orphan today and then you ’ re recovered in two weeks. ” Read : The staggering number of kids who have lost a parent to COVID-19 Even if orphans face an immense set of challenges , their fate isn ’ t sealed : For decades , researchers have known that programs that tap into children ’ s extraordinary resilience can help orphans overcome the unthinkable , especially if kids get help in the immediate aftermath of a death . And yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphans has not proved to be much of a pressing issue in the United States . No law or executive order has provided any resources specifically for pandemic orphans , even as Congress and the White House have spent trillions of dollars to help Americans get through this crisis . And while a memorandum issued by President Joe Biden yesterday promises that the administration will develop a plan for orphans , it ’ s poised to be too little , too late . “ It really doesn ’ t outline any plan or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social epidemiologist at Stony Brook University , told me . And the inaction goes deeper than that : With a few exceptions , even the parts of the country most inclined toward action don ’ t seem to be doing much to help these kids . “ No one has even established a system for figuring out who these children are , ” Hillis said . The pandemic ’ s orphanhood crisis matters most for orphans , but it also matters for the rest of us . If America can ’ t do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by COVID , what hope is there to make any sort of long-lasting changes as we try to leave the pandemic behind ? A 10-year-old in New York City who lost her father in the first wave of early 2020 . Four children in Boynton Beach , Florida , left behind by a single mother who died 48 hours after being taken to the hospital . A 6-year-old boy and an 8-year-old girl from McAlester , Oklahoma , who lost their mother to COVID just two and a half years after losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID deaths now nearing 1 million , all types of American children have been orphaned by the pandemic . But the well-documented racial and ethnic disparities in the virus ’ s toll are further compounded in caregiver loss . For example , the COVID death rate for Hispanic Americans is just slightly higher than that for white Americans , but Hispanic caregiver loss is more than double that of white Americans . Similar trends hold for other groups , according to an analysis by Dan Treglia , a social-policy researcher at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the COVID Collaborative , a coalition of experts in health , education , and economics . Because of how easily COVID can spread within a household , some kids have lost both parents ; others may have lost a grandparent who was a primary caregiver . Almost a quarter of American children live with one parent and no other adults , meaning it can take only a single death for catastrophic loss to occur . Because these children are disproportionately low-income and nonwhite , they already face systemic barriers that amplify the fallout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start . Unlike some other diseases that leave children orphaned , COVID strikes quickly . It ’ s more like a car crash than cancer . With COVID , “ somebody drops dead in weeks , ” Hillis said . It ’ s so sudden that no one has even thought about , “ Oh my goodness , who ’ s gon na take care of the kids ? ” Read : There is no one pandemic anniversary . There are millions of them . Despite the urgency , the national response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal government has set aside funds to help pay for the funerals of Americans who died from COVID . While that ’ s a laudable effort that helps offset costs at a crucial moment , the money is hardly the kind of investment needed to support the long-term needs of orphaned children . Yesterday , as part of the presidential memorandum addressing the long-term effects of COVID , the Biden administration made a vague promise that federal agencies would draw up a report within several months outlining how they ’ ll support “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to COVID-19. ” But Mary C. Wall , a senior policy adviser on the White House ’ s COVID-19 Response Team who will serve as the “ bereavement lead , ” told me that the effort won ’ t have a dedicated team and will be focused on raising awareness about existing resources for families rather than implementing initiatives that would require new funds . At some point , Wall said , the program might request additional funding , but that ask could run into problems , given that Congress struggled to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as treatments , tests , and vaccines . It ’ s not just the Biden administration that ’ s been slow to confront the greatest mass-orphanhood event in a generation . Only in the past few months has there been any political movement anywhere in the country . Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey and Haley Stevens of Michigan , both Democrats , introduced a resolution in March to “ raise awareness ” of COVID ’ s impact on bereaved children , but it ’ s little more than a hopeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , targeted efforts seem to be the exception , not the rule . California State Senator Nancy Skinner introduced a bill to set up trust funds of $ 4,000 to $ 8,000 for each of the state ’ s more than 20,000 pandemic orphans . It is working its way through the legislature , and a spokesperson for the senator said he was not aware of any resistance . At the local level , some counties are moving forward on their own as well . Santa Clara County , California , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds , a portion of which will be used to identify and support children who lost caregivers to COVID ( the details of the program haven ’ t been announced ) . Read : How did this many deaths become normal ?

The irony is that the U.S. already has the know-how to piece together that strategy . During the HIV epidemic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world ’ s orphanhood needs . The President ’ s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , established in 2003 , earmarks 10 percent of its annual $ 7 billion budget specifically for orphans . “ If we wanted to focus on children at home , we could absolutely do that , ” Kidman said . “ The expertise is there if the will is there. ” What America needs to be doing right now , Kidman said , is providing help—financially and psychologically—to both orphans and their families . Experts I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , but warned that counseling isn ’ t sufficient . And if yesterday ’ s memorandum is any clue , the White House has no clear plan for the unique psychological challenges of orphanhood , and could even end up simply rebranding existing mental-health services as a bereavement program . Regular cash transfers can reduce trauma and anxiety symptoms among orphans and boost school completion by 22 percent . It ’ s unlikely that the White House ’ s plan to reimburse funeral costs will have the same effect . “ The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bucket . These families need sustained financial support , ” Joyal Mulheron , the founder of Evermore , a bereavement nonprofit , told me . One promising approach is “ cash plus care ” programs , which stabilize families with regular cash infusions coupled with interventions that help enhance caregivers ’ parenting skills . That said , some funds may already be available—just untapped . Bereaved children have long been eligible for Social Security benefits , yet the best available data suggest that less than half of all orphans are receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Biden administration is sensibly trying to connect children with existing benefits , but Wall offered few details about how the administration will actually achieve that . Popular legislation such as the expanded child tax credit , which temporarily slashed poverty , could be a lifeline for the disproportionately low-income children orphaned by COVID—but Congress allowed that temporary benefit hike to expire at the end of last year . Solving the orphanhood crisis might not feel as urgent as , say , developing a vaccine did . But time is of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father in March 2020 is getting ready to enter kindergarten this fall .

Perhaps the country would realize that our health-care system is nowhere near good enough .

But as the pandemic enters year three , it ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about changing as little as possible . Yes , we ’ re in a relative lull of case counts and deaths . But just because people aren ’ t dying at the same rate they were at the pandemic ’ s peaks doesn ’ t mean the crisis is over for the 200,000 children set adrift in one of the most unimaginable ways possible . “ Pretending that these kids can just go back to normal is going to be a mistake , ” Kidman said . “ There isn ’ t a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ” """"""",0

""""""" China and Russia flew six nuclear bombers over the Sea of Japan this week as President Joe Biden was in Tokyo . It was a dramatic show of unity that should remind us of the lessons that we ’ ve learned from Ukraine—and that we should be ready to apply to Taiwan , possibly soon . China has been doubling down its intimidation tactics toward Taiwan in recent months . Beijing sent a carrier group , led by its first in-service aircraft carrier , the Liaoning , to conduct military drills in waters near Taiwan in April . “ Similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis in the future , ” a Chinese naval official said . The following week , China sent 25 fighter jets and nuclear bombers into Taiwan ’ s air defense identification zone ( ADIZ ) . Such incursions have become more common since September , with 77 warplanes sent in the first two days of October and 56 more on Oct. 4 . By some accounts , China would lose the battle for Taiwan—at least as things stand now . Harlan Ullman , senior advisor at the Atlantic Council , has said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwanese today , the traditional three-to-one ratio of attackers to defenders taught at war colleges dictates that China would need to deploy over 1.2 million troops . This would take thousands of ships and weeks of transfer time and , as Ullman notes , “ China possesses a small fraction of the necessary ships to execute a landing of that size. ” Still , China may have the numbers to pull off an invasion by the end of the decade . On his first trip to Asia since taking office , Biden suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the U.S. would do more to defend Taiwan than it has done for Ukraine , where no U.S. troops have been sent . Speaking at a press conference in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida , Biden was asked if the U.S. would militarily defend Taiwan and replied , “ Yes , that ’ s the commitment we made. ” “ They ’ re already flirting with danger right now by flying so close , ” he said , adding , “ but the United States is committed . We support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not mean China has the jurisdiction to use force to go in and take Taiwan. ” Later that day , a White House official clarified that Biden ’ s apparent gaffe did not suggest any change in U.S. posture towards Taiwan or the One China policy . Nevertheless , within hours , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin warned that China “ will take firm actions to safeguard its sovereignty and security interests. ” This is a worrying prospect , especially since Taiwanese overwhelmingly oppose unification with China , which means any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce resistance and support from the U.S. and other Western powers . In other words , we may see the horrors of Mariupol and Bucha unfold on Taiwanese shores , particularly as Xi Jinping is apparently just as obsessed with Taiwan as Vladimir Putin is with Ukraine , and for similar ethno-nationalist reasons . For Xi , what matters most is not what Taiwanese want for themselves , but their racial identity . As he often says about Taiwan , blood is thicker than water . In other words , not even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as Cindy Yu of The Spectator has pointed out , he also likes to refer to Taiwan as part of the family not as an expression of affection , but as a warning to the U.S. and others that this is a family matter , so keep out of it . This raises the question : Now that we 've taken a stand with Ukraine , and now that alliances once seen as fading have proven themselves more resilient than ever , will the line hold when it comes to Taiwan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real differences between Ukraine and Taiwan . First and foremost is our economic relationship with China . Trade between the two biggest economies is tightly interwoven : the value of U.S. goods imports from China rose from about $ 100 billion in 2001 to $ 500 billion in 2017 , largely due to China ’ s growing role in global supply chains . And while this has led to manufacturing job losses and technology transfers via IP theft , not to mention labor and human rights violations in places such as Xinjiang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many politicians reluctant to pursue conflict , and will dim the West ’ s willingness to sanction China as much as we have Russia . As Timothy Snyder recently argued in a New York Times opinion piece : “ We should say it . Russia is fascist. ” And many already are saying it , but few are willing to do so when it comes to China despite Xi ’ s emphasis on racial loyalty , despite concentration camps in Xinjiang or reports of genocidal forced sterilizations , despite the extinguishing of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong , or an obviously undaunting thirst to invade Taiwan . Point being , China is a more complicated problem than Russia . But given China ’ s political and economic weight , it ’ s also a problem that is important to get right . Thankfully , we ’ ve learned a few solid lessons from Ukraine . For one , we ’ ve learned that , despite what Biden said this week , direct conflict is not necessary . The U.S. can reshape Taiwan ’ s military with some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ukraine : namely , Stinger anti-aircraft and Javelin anti-tank missiles . Taiwan has also learned these lessons . “ The Ukrainian people are very brave , and one of the tactics that has been successful so far is the asymmetric capability , '' Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said this week , adding that he was specifically referring to Ukraine ’ s use of Stinger and Javelin missiles , and that although Taiwan has some of these already , it wants to stockpile more . But China has learned these lessons too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C.-based defense analyst , some of the key takeaways Beijing will likely pull from Ukraine are the value of asymmetric weapons for Taiwan , the importance of rock-steady logistics , and the need to strike with overwhelming force in order for an invasion to succeed . “ Modern technologies allow high-cost systems necessary for an invasion to be defeated by relatively low-cost systems such as anti-ship missiles and Stinger missiles , and this situation is exacerbated by the defense dominant nature of the region in which the PLA must traverse the Taiwan Strait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Rather than cause hesitation from the PLA , I ’ d venture to say it will push them to double down and ensure they approach the invasion with overwhelming force . The conflict in Ukraine has made it apparent that the fait accompli may not be a realistic model for success. ” In other words , both sides are learning the same lessons and trying to counter their use , bringing to mind an old expression : what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object ? One thing that happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of innocent lives lost . To prevent this , we have to exhaust diplomatic measures without falling into the trap of pursuing diplomacy . We also have to prepare Taiwan for the coming threat , and unlike with Ukraine , we have to start now . Read more at The Daily Beast .

"Sept. 11 marked the 50th anniversary of the Chilean coup, a bloody U.S.-backed military overthrow that catalyzed the brutal 17-year dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Not by accident, El Conde, the satirical horror that renders Pinochet as a 250-year-old vampire, began releasing in theaters on Sept. 7 and comes to Netflix on Sept. 15, bookending the date. “It was an odd day,” Pablo Larraín, who co-wrote and directed the film, tells TIME following the anniversary. “I might have been naive, but I think many of us thought that a national agreement that something like this should never happen again could be [instilled] in the vast majority. That did not happen.” El Conde is surreal—Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) is a bloodthirsty vampire who exists in the present day and refuses to die, to the ire of his inheritance-hungry children. His mother, the film reveals in the third act, is Margaret Thatcher, also a vampire—and it’s a gory horror movie. The vampires hunt for hearts, flying over contemporary Santiago, targeting victims, slicing still-beating hearts out of chests, and blending them into mealy smoothies.",0

Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans told the Economic Club of New York late last month that the rate-setting FOMC will “ probably ” venture beyond neutral . “ On the way to December , you ’ d be looking for any confirmation of the storyline , ” Evans said . “ It could be that short-term neutral is actually lower , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it ’ s actually contractionary for a variety of reasons . It could go the other way too , ” he said . That said , the 2.4 percent figure has led to disagreement among some economists , who purport that a neutral rate is a lot higher when the central bank ’ s preferred inflation gauge—the personal consumption expenditure ( PCE ) price index—is running north of 5 percent . According to the CME FedWatch Tool , most of the market is penciling in another half-point rate hike next month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market analysts expecting sluggish growth in the coming months , it is going to be “ a delicate balancing act ” for the Fed , says John Leer , Morning Consult chief economist . Powell has stated that his goal is to accomplish a soft landing : lowering inflation , supporting economic growth , and maintaining a strong labor market . “ The Federal Reserve is in a tough spot right now as it navigates elevated risks of a recession . They want to raise rates high enough and fast enough to curb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to tip the economy into a recession . It ’ s a delicate balancing act that ’ s sure to test Fed policy , ” Leer wrote in a note . Whatever happens , Ken Mahoney , the CEO and president of Mahoney Asset Management , believes the Fed has “ lost credibility overall. ” Many experts , including Mahoney , have pointed to last year ’ s insistence by the Fed that inflation was “ transitory. ” According to Mahoney , the best opportunity to raise interest rates by 50 basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GDP expanded by more than 5 percent . “ Instead , we are here raising rates when first-quarter GDP was negative and inflation is clearly here to stay , ” Mahoney told The Epoch Times . “ It feels like there ’ s a bidding war with the Fed governors . “ One says four rate hikes , another says eight , another says I ’ m more hawkish than you , I say 12 . I think at the end of the day , it will be three or four because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in this case , and the market would buckle further. ” Robert R. Johnson , chair and CEO of Economic Index Associates , disagrees with pundits who have conveyed their disapproval over the Fed ’ s actions . “ Based on past experience , pundits have expressed little confidence that the Fed will be able to get inflation under control and orchestrate a soft landing for the economy , ” Johnson , a professor of finance at Creighton University ’ s Heider College of Business , told The Epoch Times . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren Buffett , who , on Saturday , called Jay Powell ‘ a hero ’ whose aggressive action avoided an economic disaster. ” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen , who served one term as head of the central bank , asserted that the Fed must be “ skillful ” and “ also lucky ” to facilitate a soft landing . Speaking at a Wall Street Journal CEO Council conference on May 4 , Yellen reaffirmed her confidence in the post-pandemic U.S. economy , but conceded that inflation remains a problem . On the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the May 6 jobs report for April and next week ’ s April consumer price index ( CPI ) numbers . Economists expect that the U.S. economy created 394,000 new jobs last month .

""""""" In the ruling handed down Friday , the high court said parents have a fundamental right to maintain family relationships and to the “ custody , care and control ” of their children . But the Idaho state law “ seemingly allows grandparents to seek visitation over the objection of fit parents , ” Justice John Stegner wrote for the unanimous court . That makes the visitation law unconstitutional , the court found . The case arose in 2017 after Dennis and Linda Nelson asked a magistrate judge to award them visitation with their grandchildren after the grandchildren 's parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off contact . Neither attorneys for the Nelsons nor the Evanses immediately responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press . But the family members ' relationship had been full of strife for some time , in part because the grandmother strongly objected to the parent 's marriage — resulting in no communication between the two sides for nearly a year — and in part because the Evanses felt the grandmother was manipulative and repeatedly violated their boundaries . The Nelsons and Evanses also had disputes over a jointly owned California home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to Idaho , according to the ruling . The discord continued when it came to childrearing , with the grandparents taking the grandchildren on extravagant playdates to places like Disneyland and frequently returning the children home later than had been requested .

The grandparents appealed and lost at the district court level , and appealed again to the Idaho Supreme Court . In 2020 , the Idaho Supreme Court found that state law did give the Nelsons the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case back to the lower court . Last year , the lower court acknowledged that the grandparents had inserted themselves into the Evans family to an “ exorbitant ” extent , and that the grandmother 's behavior had undermined the parents in the eyes of the children . Still , the lower court took issue with how the Evans family severed their children 's relationship with the grandparents , saying they may not have sufficiently explained their concern to the grandparents before cutting off ties . “ Despite finding the Nelsons had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that they had , the magistrate court then ordered visitation , ” as long as the grandparents first underwent counseling , according to court documents . Meanwhile , the Evans family filed a motion asking the court to find the visitation law unconstitutional .

The high court agreed that the law was unconstitutional , and noted the toll the case had placed on the Evans family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legal bills . “ The Nelsons ’ conduct in this case has placed a significant financial and emotional strain on Stephanie and Brian , and likely their three daughters as well , ” Stegner wrote .

China ’ s domestic aircraft manufacturing capabilities have typically lagged behind Russian engine technology . The J-11 , another Chinese-Sukhoi-copy , suffered development problems as a result of unreliable domestically produced engines , as has the J-15 . The J-15 has been plagued by engine issues and other mechanical problems that resulted in at least four accidents , and the entire fleet of J-15s being grounded for several months . One crash was fatal , and another caused severe injuries to the pilot . The issue is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the AL-31 engines , which are adequately powerful enough for the aircraft . Chinese-developed WS-10 engines were developed for the airframe , but were neither powerful enough for the J-15 to launch from China ’ s aircraft carrier with a full weapons load , and were unreliable , though recent engine developments may have resulted in an improved version . Engine upkeep is more difficult at sea than on land . Aircraft have to contend with high temperatures , high humidity , and most problematic—high salinity which is corrosive to airframes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible that this was a contributing factor to China ’ s J-15 crashes . The J-15 is one of the heaviest carrier-based planes in the world , and it tips the scales at over 35,000 pounds . However , it is also China ’ s only carrier capable airframe . For comparison , the U.S. Navy ’ s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is just over 32,000 pounds . Underpowered or unreliable engines are therefore an acute problem for the Chinese Navy . Compounding the problem is the J-15 fleet ’ s size—there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service with the PLAN . Beijing is slowly but surely expanding the PLAN and increasing China ’ s aircraft carrier capabilities .

Listen to the full conversation between Morosini and Newsweek 's H. Alan Scott on the latest Parting Shot . Available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you listen to podcasts . SUBSCRIBE TO THE PARTING SHOT WITH H. ALAN SCOTT ON APPLE PODCASTS OR SPOTIFY Are you prepared to have a lot of people share how uncomfortable they were watching the film , because it 's gon na happen really soon for you ? I hope they do . Part of me wanted to capture the discomfort and the embarrassment one gets from a parent . What 's even more surprising is that a lot of what we see in the film actually happened to you . Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from pretending to be someone you 're not and then it being witnessed . I think it makes us realize , oh , s**t , that 's something we all do . It makes us uncomfortable having to reckon with that fact . Conceptual movies about somebody pretending to be someone they 're not . So cringey is pretty inherit with that concept . And I wanted to heighten that as much as I possibly could . Because it felt right for the story . I feel like in a lot of situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a front , but it 's when we 're confronted with it , that 's when you become your most honest self in a lot of ways , do n't you think ? Yeah , I mean , when you look back at the first your first posts you ever made on Facebook or Instagram , they kill you , because you see so clearly the kind of person that you thought other people would like , and see that you 're not doing that good of a job at trying to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you 're like , what if I 'm that transparent , trying now ? What if people can see me trying to be cool or likable ? You 're kind of caught off guard and surprised by your own obviousness . Just go like , I thought I was hiding it better than that . That 's how Chuck is doing . He 's hiding his true intentions , but we 're seeing them so clearly throughout the film . I hate it when Facebook does that `` memories '' feature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You just see it and you 're like , `` Oh , I now hate myself . '' It 's just embarrassing reminders of how we were trying to signal to other people our likeability . While you were writing the script , how did you find that balance between finding the heart of the character of your dad while at the same time recognizing that his actions are really messed up ? The heart of it was the motor throughout [ the film ] , we needed to really understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's doing it potentially to try to save his son 's life . So I wanted to pose that moral question to the audience : How do we feel about doing something wrong for the right reasons ? Is that OK ? It 's not something that I 'm totally clear on . I was really trying to reckon with that throughout the writing of it . And in order to get on board with the story , we really needed to know that Chuck was doing this because he loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it romantically . Also , I wanted to kind of poke at this notion of romantic love versus familiar love , and how at its root , it 's just wanting to feel seen and understood . So even though it 's a different form that Franklin thought the love was , he still ultimately experiences the love and connection , regardless , which is confusing and interesting to me . Both Chuck 's motives and Franklin 's motives are oddly similar : they just want to connect with someone . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a believer that our entire experience around intimacy is ultimately connected to the ways we experienced intimacy as kids , and that 's kind of our model of what intimacy is . That 's usually reflected throughout our lives . I think a lot of us have a feeling that if we were totally ourselves with people in our lives , they would n't love us as much . But when we 're online , we have a certain anonymity or flexibility in our identity , we can be whoever we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost be more ourselves . So the idea of two people revealing themselves to one another under false pretenses just crushed me and fascinated me at the same time . Do you think how we connect with people online has changed since social media first started ? And what era of social media is the story set in ? That 's such a great question . I think he 's maybe in a slightly earlier day of Facebook . That said , it was important to me that he had a degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicating with him because any of us would be . Throughout the film he 's enjoying the connection but there 's also a part of him that knows , maybe this person is n't who they say they are ? So it was important to me that the audience felt like he was really pushing for those answers , otherwise it would just feel like he was too gullible and we would n't be on board with his character , we would just think he was being stupid . Now , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media , we can very quickly detect when somebody 's pretending to be someone they 're not . I mean , my mom was recently hacked on Instagram . And when people would message me and say , `` Hey , is your mom really into crypto now ? She 's asking for my backing . '' I would say , `` Dude , come on ? No . '' It 's pretty obvious . In the early days of social media , I was very active . I 'd connect with strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you have that experience ? Were you an active social media person ? And have you waned since then ? Yeah . The first iteration of the script was called Age , Sex , Location , because of early AOL chat rooms . You 'd ask people , `` ASL ? '' When I was like 11 or 12 , I had access to the internet . And so you 're hopping on chat rooms , asking people ASL , getting into all kinds of mischief . So I definitely feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those early mishaps of technology has kind of changed our brains in a way with how we interact with the world . And because you 're at such an impressionable age , when you 're 11 or 12 , you 're really building the model for how you see the world . I was really excited to be talking to all these strangers at that age . So I have a more disconnected relationship to Instagram and social media and stuff , because I think I 'm more aware of how addicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it for validation . So I try to keep it at arm 's length and just use it as functionally as I can , as opposed to entertainment . What was it like working with the incredible cast ? Especially Patton Oswalt ? I mean , Patton , he 's very emotionally intelligent . He is able to detect nuance on the page . He plays everything with a lot of heart and brings a lot of heart to everything he does . But he 's also hilarious and he 's able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had him in mind while I was writing it and working with him was one of the best creative experiences of my life . I think it was one of the most vulnerable ones for both of us , where we were both really bringing ourselves in full process . And the rest of the cast is amazing . I mean , Rachel Dratch and Lil Rel Howery are both hilarious comedic actors , but they also have so much depth . Amy Landecker is just an unbelievable person as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mom . She became good friends with my mom . She took the role so seriously . And then Claudia Zulewski just blew me away with her commitment to the role and how authentic and invested she is throughout the process . I could n't have gotten more lucky with this cast . Admitting that this story is based on a true story that happened to you is very vulnerable . Are you prepared for the kind of reactions you might get ? To be totally honest , I have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what excites me about being a storyteller in this way . Having a certain recklessness when it comes to this kind of thing , those are the storytellers that I love . When there 's risk , real risk , being taken by the storytellers themselves . Those are the stories that I lean into most . It 's also a way for me to make sure that I 'm staying really engaged with the stories , because I 've intentionally put so much skin in the game . I am motivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and to put every ounce of myself into it . I think , at our core , we 're all a lot more alike than we are different . And when we 're forthcoming about what 's really inside of us , that 's when people are able to see themselves the most , as opposed to pretending to be someone we 're not . And that 's really , thematically , in line with the movie . I have to ask , how is your relationship with your dad ? My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of humor and he loves the movie . This movie really is a love letter to him . There 's always been that mischievous sense of humor between the two of us . So he gets it .

"With the 2024 presidential election still more than one year away, voters have been flooded with misinformation and disinformation at a pace never seen before. The disinformation has led to increasing political polarization in the country as former President Donald Trump faces four criminal indictments and current President Joe Biden faces an impeachment inquiry by House Republicans. The most prominent example of disinformation, observers said, is that Trump maintains that he won the 2020 presidential election, something repeated by his supporters for more than two years. That misinformation helped cause the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection that led to more than 1,000 rioters being arrested for storming the U.S. Capitol and trying to stop the Electoral College votes that eventually confirmed Biden as president.",0

""""""" Pressure to end pandemic restrictions mounts as Ukrainians reach the U.S. border A woman who fled Ukraine with her three young children tried to cross the border between Tijuana and San Diego earlier this week — only to be turned away under sweeping pandemic border restrictions . Yesterday , U.S. immigration authorities relented , allowing the family to enter the country and seek asylum . But immigrant advocates say their story underscores the cruelty of restrictions put in place at the beginning of the pandemic by the Trump administration . `` The fact that we 're using COVID as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment in time , it 's just becoming more and more absurd and untenable for the administration , '' said Blaine Bookey , an attorney at the Center for Gender & Refugees Studies , who is representing the Ukrainian family . For more than a year , the Biden administration has quickly expelled migrants at the southern border under the controversial public health order known as Title 42 — despite repeated calls from Democratic lawmakers and immigration advocates to end the Trump-era policy . Those calls have grown louder this week as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country began to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border and a pair of court rulings on Title 42 put additional pressure on the Biden administration to make a decision about its future . `` This is not who we are as a country , '' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-NY ) said during a call with reporters on Thursday . `` Continuing this Trump era policy has defied common sense and common decency . Now 's the time to stop the madness . '' When Title 42 began nearly two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly expel all migrants they encountered — without giving them a chance to ask for asylum protection or other protections under U.S. law . Shortly after taking office , the Biden administration exempted unaccompanied migrant children from the policy . It has also allowed many migrant families to seek asylum in the U.S. For a while , the Biden administration was talking with immigrant advocates about ending Title 42 but abandoned that idea as the number of migrant apprehensions at the border soared to record levels last year . Instead , the Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defended it in court as necessary to prevent the spread of COVID -19 . Immigration authorities have continued to enforce the policy for single adults and some families , expelling migrants well over a million times since Biden took office . The Department of Homeland Security insists that Title 42 is a public health measure , not an immigration policy . DHS says it 's up to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to decide when the order should be lifted , and that no such decision has been made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disease Control and Prevention is set to expire in early April . But immigration hardliners warn that lifting Title 42 restrictions now could lead to another surge in migrant apprehensions this summer . Still , the Biden administration is under growing pressure to end the policy because of a pair of court rulings . First , a D.C . Circuit of Appeals panel ruled that the administration can not use Title 42 to send migrant families back to places where they could face persecution or torture . `` The CDC 's order looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an era with no vaccines , scarce testing , few therapeutics , and little certainty , '' wrote Judge Justin Walker , a Trump appointee , on behalf of the three-judge panel . Immigrant advocates hailed the ruling as a win because it suggests that all migrants should receive a screening and a chance to seek protections in the U.S . But it 's not clear how those screenings would work in practice . In the second case , a federal judge in Texas ruled that the Biden administration acted arbitrarily when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Title 42 . Looking to the future This all could force the administration to begin expelling unaccompanied children as soon as Saturday , immigrant advocates say . Again , it 's not clear how this would work in practice , since authorities in Mexico and other countries could refuse to accept unaccompanied minors . The Biden administration could still decide to appeal one or both of those rulings . But Democrats and immigrant advocates say there 's a better option : scrap Title 42 altogether . `` We 've come a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42 was first announced , '' said U.S. Rep. Nanette Diaz Barragán ( D-CA ) on the call with reporters yesterday . With vaccines readily available and mask mandates now lifted in much of the country , Barragán says it 's increasingly difficult to argue that these border restrictions are protecting public health . Advocates say the Biden administration has expelled tens of thousands of migrants back to Haiti and other countries where their lives could be in danger . `` We are asking to revoke Title 42 and welcome people , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cameroon , Central America , '' said Guerline Jozef , the executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance , during the call with reporters .

The host may be drinking a couple of drinks but nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pub , waiting to go to the party later . The stress hasn ’ t even begun to be put on the product-tanker market . '' “ What we are worried about and I ’ m sure some of the other people here are worried about is that this gets too good , ” said Bugbee . “ This could get crazy .

One moderator asked a tanker panel : “ Do you have any concerns on the horizon — maybe [ Russian President Vladimir ] Putin concedes ? ” But geopolitical chaos , like the energy crunch , is only good for rates if it doesn ’ t go too far .

Russia and Ukraine would look like a small bump in the road compared to what would happen . You would have an energy shock like you ’ d never seen before . The whole world economy would stop .

Bugbee said one of Scorpio ’ s product tankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Average spot rates for tri-fuel , diesel-engine LNG carriers are now over $ 450,000 per day . The more that different parts of the world fall short of energy , the higher the demand for shipping to balance out supply . That ’ s good for tanker owners — until the supply of energy maxes out and consumer and industrial demand is destroyed by high prices . “ We now have the worst energy crisis since 1979-1980 , ” said Francisco Blanch , head of global commodities at Bank of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a global oil crisis . Today , we have a crisis in gas and power markets . For the most part , it ’ s local prices ; as people like to say in financial lingo , it ’ s a ‘ glocal ’ crisis .

Spare oil production is limited . “ When you don ’ t have inventories and you don ’ t have spare capacity , any incremental upward demand swing has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand . You have to restrict demand , ” he said . Fight for LNG to heat up in 2023 Countries are bidding against each other for supplies of LNG and petroleum products . The losing bidders fall short of energy . The shipowner transporting cargo wins either way , providing a vital service for end consumers ( and for cargo shippers , who profit even after paying often exorbitant freight ) . Gordon Shearer , senior adviser of project development at Poten & Partners , said , “ India , Pakistan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy LNG at spot prices , and they ’ ve taken the brunt of this swing in price driven by Europe . We ’ ve seen demand destruction and blackouts in Pakistan and Bangladesh and cargoes being diverted away from India. ” Competition for LNG supplies will heat up even further next year .

""""""" Anticipating disruptions to airline travel over the Labor Day weekend , Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg sent a letter to the 10 largest airlines ’ chief executives censuring their recent behavior as “ unacceptable. ” “ These aren ’ t just numbers . These are missed birthday parties , graduations , time with loved ones , and important meetings , ” he wrote in August . Buttigieg threatened to post an online chart assessing the airlines ’ performance if things got worse . The secretary should and could do much more . Nightmarish airline travel conditions have become a fixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad that 38 state attorneys general , from both red states and blue states , sent a joint letter on Wednesday to Senate and House leadership explicitly calling out Buttigieg ’ s Transportation Department for failing “ to respond and provide appropriate recourse ” for frustrated airline flyers . Airlines delayed more than a million flights and canceled almost 129,000 from January to July , more than in 2021 and surpassing pre-pandemic levels by 11 percent . ​​In many cases , the airlines know beforehand that they ’ ll have to cancel flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortages or scheduling complications . They sell tickets anyway , betting that many customers won ’ t cash in the vouchers they receive . According to a Wall Street Journal investigation , the airlines made $ 10 billion in 2021 from unredeemed vouchers . Yet Buttigieg ’ s idea of getting tough on airlines seems to mean pummeling by PowerPoint . Instead , the secretary needs to use his powers . Section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act , for example , grants the secretary of transportation the authority to “ investigate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air carrier or ticket agent has been or is engaged in an unfair or deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition in air transportation or the sale of air transportation. ” In 2010 , Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood used this authority to issue severe penalties for airlines that left passengers waiting on tarmacs for hours before canceling flights , a widespread problem at the time . Many members of Buttigieg ’ s party , including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , are urging him to use that power again . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him exactly how to do it . “ Airlines knowingly advertising and booking flights they do not have adequate staff to operate are flying in the face of the law , ” James said at a press conference . Buttigieg shouldn ’ t stop there . Most of what ’ s gone wrong with flying is rooted in monopoly , and , as it happens , federal law also gives the Transportation Department substantial authority over airline mergers . After a wave of large mergers from 2010 to 2013 , just four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Big Four can tacitly collude to keep prices high and lower seat supply , which helps explain why fare hikes this summer have far surpassed inflation . Amplifying the effects of monopoly , a small group of giant institutional investors—notably BlackRock—all hold major stakes in each of the four major airlines . A 2018 paper by the economists José Azar , Martin Schmalz , and Isabel Tecu showed that this concentrated ownership structure reduces the incentive to compete and increases consumer costs . The flying public pays . Domestic ticket prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the biggest increase since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started tracking them in 1963 . This summer , leisure fares are up about 25 percent from pre-pandemic levels and 50 percent higher than in 2021 , according to the travel advisory site Hopper . Fares always go up when fuel prices do , but now ticket costs are rising far faster than jet fuel . Inflation has been very , very good for the airlines ’ bottom line . American Airlines raked in $ 13.4 billion , up 12.2 percent from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest quarterly revenue in its history ( from the second quarter of 2022 ) . The other major airlines—United , Delta , and Southwest—have posted record earnings . Consolidation also means that airlines can put customers through hellish conditions without worrying about losing market share . Loss of competition is the root cause of the industry ’ s most egregious practices , such as leaving passengers waiting on the tarmac for up to 12 hours before canceling their flights . Buttigieg can take major strides toward fixing the airline monopoly problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transportation ’ s power to block mergers , he could , under Section 411 , enact a rule prohibiting institutional investors and individual shareholders from holding more than a 1 percent share of the publicly traded airline market . In the Michigan Law Review , the antitrust attorney Jonathan Edelman wrote that “ the DOT has the clear legal authority—and the responsibility—under section 411 to address common ownership among airlines by promulgating a rule that limits investors ’ ability to own large shares of multiple airlines. ” While not a short-term fix , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry could help incentivize competition and lower airfare prices . Adding to the legal case is a political one : Airlines are taking advantage of consumers despite the $ 50 billion bailout the industry received from taxpayers during the pandemic . Yet instead of implementing such policies , Buttigieg publicly expresses his sympathy for frustrated air travelers while cajoling industry leaders to cut down on canceled flights . The secretary often seems more inclined to “ collaborate ” with the airlines , as he put it in a Fox News interview in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After meeting with airline executives before the July 4th holiday , Buttigieg expressed confidence in the industry . “ They have assured me about a number of steps that they ’ re taking , including making sure their schedules are realistic , ” he told KIRO7 , a CBS affiliate in Seattle . To his credit , earlier this month Buttigieg took steps to strengthen consumer protections for airline travelers . The Transportation Department proposed rules requiring the major airlines to offer passengers full refunds on delayed or canceled flights . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department can combat , such as neglecting to inform customers about luggage fees . These rules aren ’ t proportionate to the problem at hand . They redress lousy customer experiences but don ’ t disincentivize the airlines from malpractice in the first place . During the 2020 Democratic primaries , “ Mayor Pete ” found success as a small-city chief executive from flyover country . He spoke to heartland voters ’ genuine concerns about regional inequality , an economic force accelerated by airline deregulation . As the top airline regulator , Buttigieg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own sake , for the country ’ s sake , and for passengers everywhere . """"""",0

""""""" It does America little good to win the innovation battle for the state-of-the-art if our military , ground transportation , and infrastructure grind to a halt for lack of the common essentials , including a reliable supply of semiconductors . A recent Commerce Department survey found that U.S. manufacturers had only five days ’ worth of the semiconductors needed to sustain production lines ( compared to a roughly forty days-supply just three years ago ) . In 2021 , many U.S. auto assembly lines nearly shut down from a global supply crunch on the semiconductors now ubiquitous in modern cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this following nearly two years of Covid-19-exacerbated shortages—first , medical equipment , then computer chips , and , more recently , consumer goods of all types . Towards the end of last year , the Biden administration tapped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to rising gas prices . Whatever the merits of that decision , the existence of the stockpile provides a measure of both market and geopolitical stability . The federal government also maintains , with decidedly mixed success , stockpiles for personal protective equipment ( created after 9/11 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical minerals , and even helium . Nonetheless , given the dependencies revealed and accentuated by the pandemic , it is past time to consider expanding the scope of products and materials kept under strategic reserve—starting with semiconductors . Until recently , the merits of stockpiling any manufactured product were a largely academic discussion . Global supply chains generally delivered on time and at an agreeable cost . Commercial businesses were geared to avoid excess at all costs . Popular management techniques called for ruthless efficiency , or “ just in time ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country—vulnerable to even short interruptions . But times are changing rapidly , both geopolitically and economically . Should escalating tensions with China lead to a rapid decrease in semiconductor imports , America ’ s critical infrastructure , advanced manufacturing , and even the basic capacity of the U.S. military to operate effectively would be dangerously degraded . Recognizing these vulnerabilities , the U.S. Congress has recently considered legislation—including the CHIPS Act passing the Senate and the America Competes Act just introduced in the House—that will invest tens of billions of dollars to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . These are important steps but will take multiple years and yet more investment to establish new production and supply systems ( a new chip foundry is a multi-billion-dollar capital investment , in addition to the maze of regulations and other costs associated with any new industrial project in the United States . ) In the meantime , a dangerously high percentage of microelectronics products consumed in the United States are produced either in China ( packaging and lower-end chips ) or Taiwan and South Korea ( more advanced semiconductors ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blockade . The vulnerabilities apply not just to the advanced semiconductors found in nearly every new commercial and military system , but lower-value components like the surrounding packaging ( 98 percent of which is produced in Asia ) . There is a basic supply and demand disconnect that can not be addressed through the usual market forces and government incentives . We are confronted with a significant microelectronics problem in the present day . This can not wait to be solved in the indefinite future . To ensure an adequate supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leading edge—in the near term requires a strategic stockpile for microelectronics . It would , among other purposes , add an element of uncertainty and even deterrence to Chinese strategic calculations . The Chinese government can exert significant leverage over the United States by forcing a slow-down or outright halt to semiconductors imported from Asia . The known presence of significant domestic reserves would complicate those plans . A concerted U.S. government effort would—via bulk purchases , tax incentives , or other policies—acquire and set aside up to a month ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items from existing sources . The priority would go towards products not being generated in large quantities already by commercial markets . Unlike the Defense Department ’ s other reserves , the semiconductor stockpile should be available to alleviate supply shocks impacting civil and commercial sectors . Additionally , microelectronics supply levels should be maintained irrespective of market or budget considerations—meaning it can not be a profit center for the government . While there is understandable hesitation to “ militarize ” such tasks , the Defense Department is a natural home for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stewardship of the National Defense Stockpile of critical minerals and metals has left much to be desired , as documented by the Biden administration ’ s supply chain report last year .

""""""" Supplies like water , food , and medical supplies are essential during a disaster . However , these may not be enough . Research into past tragedies demonstrates that our mental resources may play a significant role in survival in emergency situations . We have been told that it ’ s essential to prepare for disasters throughout history . In the Bible , Genesis books 41 and 42 , God directed Joseph to stockpile enough food to survive seven years of famine . During the Middle Ages , people gathered and preserved as much food as possible during the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold winters in Europe without starving . It also helped guard against the constant threats of war , drought , and famine that were common during those times . Throughout both World Wars I and II , the United States and other nations encouraged their citizens to grow “ Victory Gardens ” to help keep the country fed during a time of food rationing . The idea of self-sufficiency became so popular that by 1944 , more than 20 million victory gardens were planted within the United States and produced over eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , it is essential to be prepared during an emergency . Most disasters are unexpected by nature and leave little time to prepare . Also , during disasters , just as we saw with the COVID-19 pandemic , people tend to engage in panic buying and other fear-driven behaviors despite being told not to by authorities . So , yes , preparation well in advance is vital . The problem is that most of us are leaving out a key component of disaster planning . DISASTER PREPARATION : THE MISSING LINK OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster plan , we often talk about stocking up on food , ammunition , and medical supplies . These things are considered to be the “ backbone ” of disaster preparation . In fact , there is a saying : “ Beans , Bullets , and Band-Aids , ” which refers to this notion . While it is true that things like food , medical supplies , and water are critical when it comes to preparing for disaster , there is an essential component that is being left out of most disaster prep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health is rarely mentioned in articles that talk about disaster preparation . Most emergency preparedness plans don ’ t even consider mental health . In fact , Ready.gov , the United States National Public Service Campaign ’ s website , urges people to stock an emergency kit with water , food , extra batteries , sleeping bags , and a can opener . But , it fails to mention anything about mental health . We are not told how to prepare emotionally for an emergency or crisis . This fact is unfortunate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our ability to survive a disaster . In fact , the importance of staying calm in an emergency can not be understated . WHY MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS TO BE A PART OF DISASTER PLANNING I ran a humanitarian relief organization in Southeast Asia in one of my previous careers . This organization worked to defend the rights and empower children who had experienced poverty , hunger , and other injustices . We provided assistance to children and communities affected by hunger , disaster , conflict , and injustices . We responded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteers , staff , and first responders worked in often dangerous and challenging environments . In leading medical outreach teams on three continents , I observed first-hand how , in a crisis , the weak link in any disaster situation wasn ’ t a lack of supplies but the emotional , spiritual , and mental health of the volunteers , staff , and first responders . When aide workers and volunteers cared for their mental health , they were better able to function under these conditions and provide life-saving assistance to others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has written numerous books on disasters and survival , says that emotions and personality influence the chance for survival during emergencies to a far greater degree than supplies or equipment . THE ROLE OF MENTAL HEALTH DURING A DISASTER On a stormy September night In 1994 , one of the worst disasters in maritime history occurred . The luxurious cruise ferry MS Estonia headed out on the Baltic Sea towards Stockholm . Unfortunately , the calm seas soon turned turbulent , and survivors recalled a loud noise as the ferry was struck by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . This caused the vessel to capsize and take on water , eventually sinking to the bottom of the ocean . Survival that night was quite simple . Action paid . Inaction resulted in death . Survivors had to act quickly to get out . People who hesitated had no chance at all . Fortunately for survivors , help arrived quickly . The ship ’ s captain declared an emergency fairly quickly , and rescuers arrived within a half-hour , ready to assist . This disaster was one of Europe ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the early emergency response , more than 85 percent of those on board perished . Survival experts who reviewed the disaster were astonished at how many people did not survive . Experts say that far more people should have been saved because of the swiftness with which help arrived . Researchers into the tragedy finally concluded that the factors that prevented more people from being rescued were fear and anxiety . According to official reports , a large number of people on the doomed ship seemed to be incapable of rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Survivors described people “ rushing to and fro without a purpose ” like scared animals . People panicked , crawling around on the promenade and crying . Others sat apathetically against the walls refusing to budge even when other passengers and rescuers tried to guide them or use force to get them to act . They were petrified and could not be compelled to move . Despite being provided with life vests and other supplies , many people on the ship died because they were paralyzed by their emotions . During emergencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . When faced with a threat , the body goes into “ fight or flight ” mode . It prepares itself by suddenly producing the hormones adrenaline as well as cortisol . These hormones are what prompt you to act quickly . This is helpful for survival because often , time is of the essence . However , on the flip side , the physiological process that occurs can impair your ability to think critically . As a result , your emotions take over . This can cause you to behave in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened in the case of MS Estonia . Just as our mental health impacts our ability to cope with emergencies , a disaster can seriously impact our mental health . The COVID-19 pandemic led to sweeping changes in our lives that resulted in a mental health crisis as much as a physical health one . Social isolation , restrictions in our day-to-day lives , job loss , illness and death of loved ones all led to increased feelings of anxiety , grief , despair , and depression during the pandemic . Experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lasting impact on mental health . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , there was a 25 percent increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression worldwide due to the pandemic . The WHO calls this a “ wake-up ” call and stresses the importance of paying more attention to mental health . Not everyone experienced worsening mental health issues during the pandemic . There are certain factors that lead some groups of people to experience more issues . These include having a previous history of mental health issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being socially isolated . Taking care of our mental health before and after a disaster can help us cope better during a crisis and recover quicker . I have a family friend named Flo who survived the Nazi firebombing of London in WWII as a young girl . She describes feeling almost incapacitated by fear during the war . However , during this time , Flo was responsible for taking care of a chicken during this time . She said that being responsible for the chicken gave her the strength to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could keep the chicken alive , she too could stay alive . Flo credits caring for a chicken as something she did for her mental health . She said that this action saved her . It gave her inner strength and resilience when she needed it the most . HOW TO EMOTIONALLY PREPARE FOR A DISASTER So , how can you prepare mentally for a disaster ? Here are some practical and straightforward ways to manage your mental health before , during , and after a disaster . Having emotional stability is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A hopeful , positive outlook can go a long way . When you can manage your emotions , you can make better decisions and plan for uncertainties . Developing the ability to manage your emotions takes practice . Once you learn the skills , you can draw on them to get you through the disaster . Be Aware of Your Emotional Response in an Emergency It ’ s not uncommon for people to have strong emotional reactions during emergencies , especially during things like terrorist attacks . If you are separated from family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may feel extreme anxiety or fear .

I put those questions and more to O ’ Donnell and Michael Kugelman , the Afghanistan expert who writes Foreign Policy ’ s South Asia Brief . Subscribers can watch the full interview here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcript of our conversation . Foreign Policy : Lynne , what did your recent experience of being detained by the Taliban reveal to you about their ability to rule ? Lynne O ’ Donnell : I think that it ’ s a really good question , because it takes it beyond me and my experience and into the realm of what it ’ s really like in Afghanistan under the Taliban , and that was the reason that I went . It had been almost a year since I left Afghanistan on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were entering the city , and there ’ s been so much confusion about what the situation there is really like . And so I wanted to go and see for myself . What I learned was , aside from a kind of comical level of incompetence , was the impunity with which Taliban officials believe that they can operate . I was threatened and held against all conventions of human rights and international law . People who I came in contact with were later detained and interrogated . My driver was held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten up , deprived of sleep . His phone and his car were kept , though were given back to him after about a week . But … even the manager of the guesthouse where I stayed was threatened . He was told , we can come and shut you down whenever we want . So there is this undercurrent of violence , and we ’ ve been hearing for the past year some terrible stories about arbitrary detentions and beatings . A lot of people are still in prison and in hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled over land borders . It ’ s a regime that is uncomfortable with anything but violence , and the only way of pressing its authority is through the threat or the use of violence . FP : Michael , what did the strike that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri [ on July 31 ] reveal about the Taliban ’ s ability to govern the country ? Michael Kugelman : Certainly that strike exploded the myth propagated by the Taliban that they are denying space to terrorist groups . And it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was the agreement signed between the Trump administration and the Taliban in 2020 , which says that the Taliban will not let Afghan soil be used by those that threaten the security of the U.S. For many , the Doha deal is viewed as a source of international legitimacy for the Taliban . So it ’ s a big blow in that regard . Clearly , Zawahiri could not have been living where he was , for as long as he did , without someone high up in the Taliban knowing—and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to control that neighborhood where he was very tightly . And there have been multiple reports indicating that a close aide of Siraj Haqqani owned the house where Zawahiri was . And , of course , Siraj Haqqani is a top leader in the Haqqani network , and he happens to be the interior minister of the Taliban regime . So I think that it will certainly make it harder for the Taliban to get the international recognition that many , but not all , of their leaders want . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the biggest concern is about terrorism risks and concerns that the Taliban is not doing enough to curb terrorism on its soil . Clearly , when the head of al Qaeda is discovered to be living right in the middle of Kabul , it ’ s going to raise those concerns even more . FP : Michael , how is Islamabad viewing the Taliban ’ s rule and dealing with it ? I know you watch Pakistan very closely . MK : My sense is that perhaps Pakistan has had a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sense that the Taliban is now in control in Kabul . Initially , I think that may have been welcomed by many within the state , because for many years Pakistan ’ s main interest in Afghanistan is for there to be a government in Kabul friendly to Pakistan . And , of course , the Taliban has had a long relationship with Pakistan , but we ’ ve seen over the last year that a number of tensions have cropped into the relationship between Pakistan and the Taliban . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border . The Taliban has never accepted the Afghanistan-Pakistan border , and that ’ s in line with just about every government in Afghanistan that ’ s been in power since Pakistan became independent . All Afghan governments in recent years have not accepted that border , and the Taliban hasn ’ t either , and Pakistani soldiers have been trying to put up fencing along the border , and they got into a bit of a tussle with Afghan fighters . The other issue is the Pakistani Taliban . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ’ s ramped up its attacks in Pakistan in recent months . It ’ s based in Afghanistan . And Pakistan might have hoped that the Taliban would try to curb that threat , but it has not . The Taliban has mediated talks between the Pakistani Taliban and the Pakistani state . They haven ’ t gone very well . They ’ ve reached an impasse . And so , as a result , Pakistan does have a problem on its hands . Now , the relationship certainly between the Pakistani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complex than many suggest . There ’ s always been some disagreements . Some within the Taliban have mistrusted Pakistan for a number of reasons , but I think that ’ s sort of been brought out a bit more now that the Taliban is in power . But for sure , despite all that , I think the Taliban does look to Pakistan as a country that it hopes can assist , whether in terms of financial assistance or assistance beyond that . But again , no country , including Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taliban regime yet , which is significant . FP : You mentioned the phrase “ buyer ’ s remorse. ” India , on the other hand , which definitely didn ’ t want this situation at all , has just reopened its embassy in Kabul . They ’ d obviously prefer a democracy in the region , but they are now engaging in diplomatic discussions with the Taliban . How is that working out ? MK : For me , one of the most striking takeaways are the regional geopolitics . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. left , that countries like China and Russia and Pakistan would swoop in and be willing to work with the Taliban , and that would disadvantage India , which had been very close to the non-Taliban governments but clearly does not have a friendship with the Taliban . And Taliban fighters have attacked Indian interests and Indian nationals in Afghanistan in the past . But instead , Pakistan has had these problems with the Taliban , and India has indeed moved in , partially reopened its embassy . And I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd decision in the sense that New Delhi likely believes that it ’ s easier to pursue its own interests in Afghanistan with more of a presence on the ground . India does have a long history of providing development assistance to the country . It wants to keep exploring how to pursue its own interests regarding its concerns about terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed , which do have a presence in Afghanistan and threaten India . I think India certainly wants to be able to try to counter potential Pakistani and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally , India wants to try to facilitate access to Central Asia , a critical region for India , looking to markets and energy resources there . FP : Lynne , I want to ask you about the broader humanitarian situation on the ground . You ’ ve obviously covered this over the last year , but also in the years when you were living there . What ’ s your sense of the additional steps that the international community could take to make more of a difference ? LO : It ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there ’ s been an awful lot of revisionism in the last year with people wanting to believe that the Taliban takeover has made things terrible , whereas they were pretty terrible under the republic as well . Afghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world . Its government was one of the most corrupt . Even before the collapse of the republic , U.N. agencies were predicting 11 million people would be facing hunger and children would die last winter . The Taliban have made that worse , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to run an economy , and they don ’ t seem to be trying . And even though there are attempts to say that they ’ re much more efficient and much less corrupt , for instance , collecting taxes at the borders , that money isn ’ t going into feeding people , creating jobs , developing an economy where people have the hope that things will get better tomorrow . I would say probably a first step would be to get moving on the negotiations for the release of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the $ 9 billion of Afghanistan ’ s foreign reserves . There has to be a way of making sure that that money can reach Afghan people . You have to get money flowing so that businesspeople can pay employees , buy supplies , and really get the economy moving . What I found when I went there was everything had stopped . There was no commercial activity at all . Bread prices tripled . People queuing up at the very rare functioning construction site for work as day laborers . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unaffordable , and the Taliban have stolen cars owned by private citizens . It ’ s a really dire situation . One diplomat suggested to me there could be food riots , there could be mass demonstrations against the humiliation of the poverty that people have been plunged into . """"""",0

If we haven ’ t learned by now , we should beware of anything the government insists is for our own good . Take the Biden Administration ’ s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act . Given the deteriorating state of the nation ’ s infrastructure ( aging highways and bridges , outdated railways and airports , etc . ) , which have been neglected for years in order to fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would seem like an obvious and long overdue fix . Tucked into the whopping $ 1 trillion bipartisan spending bill is a provision requiring automakers to prescribe a “ federal motor vehicle safety standard for advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology , and for other purposes. ” It ’ s pretty clear that the goals of this section of the law are to reduce drunk driving fatalities and crashes via still-undetermined technological tools that somehow are able to “ passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impaired , ” and/or “ passively and accurately detect whether the blood alcohol concentration of a driver of a motor vehicle is equal to or greater than the blood alcohol concentration described in section 163 ( a ) of title 23 , United States Code , ” and if either or both of these conditions are proven to be positive — if the car thinks you ’ re drunk , then it may “ prevent or limit motor vehicle operation. ” As expected , the details are disconcertingly vague , which leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seeds of mischief and mayhem . For instance , nowhere does the legislation indicate how such a so-called “ kill switch ” would work , what constitutes a driver who is “ impaired , ” and what “ other purposes ” might warrant the government using such a backdoor kill switch . Everything about this mandatory measure should set off red flares . First , use of the word “ passively ” suggests the system will always be on and constantly monitoring the vehicle . Secondly , the system must connect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to disable the vehicle either before driving or during , when impairment is detected . Thirdly , it will be an “ open ” system , or at least one with a backdoor , meaning authorized ( or unauthorized ) third-parties can remotely access the system ’ s data at any time . This is a privacy disaster in the making , and the fact that the provision made it through the Congress reveals — yet again — how little its members care about the privacy of their constituents… The lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle presents numerous and extremely serious safety issues… If that is not reason enough for concern , there are serious legal issues with this mandate . Other vehicle-related enforcement methods used by the Nanny State , such as traffic cameras and license plate readers , have long presented constitutional problems ; notably with the 5th Amendment ’ s right to not self-incriminate , and the 6th Amendment ’ s right to face one ’ s accuser . Once again , the burden of proof is reversed , and “ we the people ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven guilty but suspects in a suspect society . These “ vehicle kill switches ” may be sold to the public as a safety measure aimed at keeping drunk drivers off the roads , but they will quickly become a convenient tool in the hands of government agents to put the government in the driver ’ s seat while rendering null and void the Constitution ’ s requirements of privacy and its prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures . Indeed , when you think about it , these vehicle kill switches are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to not only take control of our cars but also our freedoms and our lives . For too long , we have been captive passengers in a driverless car controlled by the government , losing more and more of our privacy and autonomy the further down the road we go . Just think of all the ways in which the government has been empowered to dictate what we say , do and think ; where we go ; with whom we associate ; how we raise our families ; how we live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we spend our money ; how we protect ourselves and our loved ones ; and to what extent our rights as individuals can be displaced for the sake of the so-called greater good . In this way , we have arrived , way ahead of schedule , into the dystopian future dreamed up by such science fiction writers as George Orwell , Aldous Huxley , Margaret Atwood and Philip K. Dick . In keeping with Dick ’ s darkly prophetic vision of a dystopian police state—which became the basis for Steven Spielberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was released 20 years ago—we have been imprisoned in a world in which the government is all-seeing , all-knowing and all-powerful , and if you dare to step out of line , dark-clad police SWAT teams and pre-crime units will crack a few skulls to bring the populace under control . Minority Report is set in the year 2054 , but it could just as well have taken place in 2022 . Incredibly , as the various nascent technologies employed and shared by the government and corporations alike—facial recognition , iris scanners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so on—are incorporated into a complex , interwoven cyber network aimed at tracking our movements , predicting our thoughts and controlling our behavior , Spielberg ’ s unnerving vision of the future is fast becoming our reality . Both worlds—our present-day reality and Minority Report ’ s celluloid vision of the future—are characterized by widespread surveillance , behavior prediction technologies , data mining , fusion centers , driverless cars , voice-controlled homes , facial recognition systems , cybugs and drones , and predictive policing ( pre-crime ) aimed at capturing would-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surveillance cameras are everywhere . Government agents listen in on our telephone calls and read our emails . Political correctness—a philosophy that discourages diversity—has become a guiding principle of modern society . The courts have shredded the Fourth Amendment ’ s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures . In fact , SWAT teams battering down doors without search warrants and FBI agents acting as a secret police that investigate dissenting citizens are common occurrences in contemporary America . We are increasingly ruled by multi-corporations wedded to the police state . Much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs or ones prescribed by doctors . And bodily privacy and integrity has been utterly eviscerated by a prevailing view that Americans have no rights over what happens to their bodies during an encounter with government officials , who are allowed to search , seize , strip , scan , spy on , probe , pat down , taser , and arrest any individual at any time and for the slightest provocation . We ’ re on the losing end of a technological revolution that has already taken hostage our computers , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our shopping , our appliances , and now , our cars . As if the government wasn ’ t already able to track our movements on the nation ’ s highways and byways by way of satellites , GPS devices , and real-time traffic cameras , performance data recorders , black box recorders and vehicle-to-vehicle ( V2V ) communications will monitor our vehicle ’ s speed , direction , location , gear selection , brake force , the number of miles traveled and seatbelts use , and transmit this data to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Brave New World , there is no communication not spied upon , no movement untracked , no thought unheard .

These vehicle kill switches are yet another Trojan Horse : sold to us as safety measures for the sake of the greater good , all the while poised to wreak havoc on what little shreds of autonomy we have left .

""""""" Compensating for the lost time may prove challenging for scientists , says Astronomy magazine . Turning the internet clock back one second implies a repeat of a computer-generated timestamp for example , which might confuse some vital systems not designed to handle that . – – – Ever feel like there ’ s just not enough time in the day ? Turns out , you might be onto something . Earth is rotating faster than it has in the last half-century , resulting in our days being ever-so-slightly shorter than we ’ re used to . And while it ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s become a big headache for physicists , computer programmers and even stockbrokers . . . . “ As time goes on , there is a gradual divergence between the time of atomic clocks and the time measured by astronomy , that is , by the position of Earth or the moon and stars , ” says Judah Levine , a physicist in the time and frequency division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology . Basically , a year as recorded by atomic clocks was a bit faster than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . “ In order to keep that divergence from getting too big , in 1972 , the decision was made to periodically add leap seconds to atomic clocks , ” Levine says . Leap seconds work a little like the leap days that we tack on to the end of February every four years to make up for the fact that it really takes around 365.25 days for Earth to orbit the Sun . But unlike leap years , which come steadily every four years , leap seconds are unpredictable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps tabs on how quickly the planet spins by sending laser beams to satellites to measure their movement , along with other techniques . When the time plotted by Earth ’ s movement approaches one second out of sync with the time measured by atomic clocks , scientists around the world coordinate to stop atomic clocks for exactly one second , at 11:59:59 pm on June 30 or December 31 , to allow astronomical clocks to catch up . Voila — a leap second . Since the first leap second was added in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every few years . They ’ re added irregularly because Earth ’ s rotation is erratic , with intermittent periods of speeding up and slowing down that interrupt the planet ’ s millions-of-years-long gradual slowdown . “ The rotation rate of Earth is a complicated business .

There hasn ’ t been a leap second added since 2016 , and our planet is currently spinning faster than it has in half a century . “ This lack of the need for leap seconds was not predicted , ” Levine says . “ The assumption was , in fact , that Earth would continue to slow down and leap seconds would continue to be needed . And so this effect , this result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much Earth ’ s rotations speed up and how long that trend continues , scientists might have to take action . “ There is this concern at the moment that if Earth ’ s rotation rate increases further that we might need to have what ’ s called a negative leap second , ” Whibberley says . “ In other words , instead of inserting an extra second to allow Earth to catch up , we have to take out a second from the atomic timescale to bring it back into state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second would present scientists with a whole new set of challenges . “ There ’ s never been a negative leap second before and the concern is that software that would have to handle that has never been tested operationally before , ” Whibberley adds .

At the time I began writing this article , that thing was going face-first down a water slide on Michigan ’ s Mackinac Island , but , to excerpt the enumeration here by the Athletic ’ s Austin Meek , Harbaugh ’ s recent activities have also included : • Delivering the keynote address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs and declaring his belief that abortion should be illegal even if it “ might involve incredible hardship for the mother , family , and society. ” ( His employer ’ s stated response to the recent Supreme Court decision striking down Roe is that it believes strongly in the right to an abortion and “ will continue to offer abortion care ” in its own medical facilities . ) • Following those comments up by telling ESPN that if a Michigan player or staff member impregnates someone or becomes pregnant and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the resulting child , he and his wife will take it and raise it in their family . In his exact words , “ Sarah and I will take that baby. ” • Telling the assembled press at the Big Ten ’ s preseason media day that he believes the league ’ s television revenue is premised on the use of college players ’ so-called “ name , image , and likeness ” rights—and that , as such , the players should receive some of the money , a comment that casually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell , the first major college coach or administrator to support direct revenue sharing in NCAA athletics . • Hosting former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick , who has been effectively blackballed from the league since 2016 for protesting police brutality by kneeling during the playing of the national anthem , for a throwing exhibition at Michigan ’ s spring scrimmage . If that strikes you as an unusual combination of sociopolitical positions , well , we ’ re just getting started . During his tenure at Michigan , Harbaugh has invited Barack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that he would show his team Clint Eastwood ’ s American Sniper after a screening elsewhere on campus was canceled , cited both Malcolm X and ex–Ohio State coach Woody Hayes ( a public supporter of the war in Vietnam ) as inspirations for a pair of black-rimmed glasses , participated in a Black Lives Matter march , and made multiple D.C. appearances on behalf of a federally funded legal-aid nonprofit called the Legal Services Corporation . ( The university reversed its decision to cancel the Sniper screening , and , per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Muslim students to discuss the issue . ) In the meantime he ’ s been all over the place as an on-field coach .

( The player-host has denied making such a threat , which was reported to authorities by a third party and was not said to have been made directly to the alleged victim . He was not charged with a crime . Portnoy says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan ’ s athletic department responded to a request for comment on the appearance as follows : “ Thank you for reaching out . Your message has been received. ” ) How does a person end up like this ? I ’ ve been engaged in Harbaugh Studies for some time ; my upcoming book , The Hot Seat , is an account of the 2021 college football season that follows the coach and his team . ( Out Aug. 30 and currently available for pre-order anywhere books are sold ! ) Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ’ s larger than Harbaugh himself : Why does the sport of college football drive otherwise well-adjusted , successful , popular , and physically attractive people like me insane ? It turns out the answer helps explain Harbaugh and his limitless capacity to polarize and astound . The root of it all is that college football is the U.S. sport most closely tied to local identity and local institutions . That ’ s why it is popular—people care about where they are from and who they are—and also why it is perennially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with itself . The U.S. has an unusually decentralized system of higher education , in which standalone institutions compete against one another for prestige and resources . Many of America ’ s universities , moreover , were founded during the 19th century , a period of economic and political competition between states and territories themselves . It was hoped that the schools would be intellectually and culturally distinguished , but also that they would be engines of industrial and agricultural advantage , as well as training academies that could turn the children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . When American football arrived in the later part of that century , it was in some ways an ideal fit for this environment . It required collective coordination and ingenuity , but also individual courage and aggression . It was , relatedly , exciting and spectacular . This made it a good way to get members of the local population , not just the highly educated ones , to support a university and think of themselves as members of its community . Regional success ( or in the case of schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and university football team success were mutually related . However , when one thing is supposed to appeal to and represent everyone , certain conflicts can arise , as executives at Disney are presently being made aware . NCAA football is a violent , militaristic game played in cities that are generally known as regional outposts of liberalism and high culture . ( Michigan in particular must balance the interests of its hippie-Boomer Ann Arbor community with those of alumni and donors like Stephen Ross , a real estate tycoon with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw a high-profile 2019 fundraiser for Donald Trump . ) It requires collaboration between older , right-leaning white men and younger , left-leaning Black men . Also , because it started at schools , its players are also supposed to be students . These are some of the sport ’ s most long-standing sources of volatility , but there are some up-and-coming newer ones as well . College football is covered by an increasingly nationalized media to which the stoking of viral controversy is one of the only viable business tactics , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible reasons to see its games as referendums on their educational and/or geographical worth—have access to technology that allows them to be stoked obsessively day and night . Many of the institutions that conceive of themselves as the game ’ s most important are located in a part of the country ( the Midwest ) that has been in relative decline for more than 40 years . Supreme Court decisions regarding television rights and amateurism have destroyed the NCAA ’ s authority over Division I football , making it the only major U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even one group of people , is in charge . A college football coach ’ s seemingly impossible job is to satisfy all of these parties and their interests—and to make them proud through both on-field performance and manifested character . So , back to Jim Harbaugh , who has been familiar with these circumstances and demands all his life . It ’ s often said that if thing X didn ’ t exist , environment Y would have had to create it , but in this case , college football really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in university towns ( Ann Arbor and Palo Alto ) by a Catholic father who was a college football coach himself . Harbaugh was raised to believe that scholarship and high-level athletic competition should go together . It is natural and obvious to him that a football team , and even more acutely its head coach , should be one of the most important symbols of everyone—everyone ! —in the university and geographic community . Other coaches might steer around the treacherous ideological terrain that this role confronts them with by going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual things even if they might privately doubt the necessity of everything they are doing . But Harbaugh is not a going-through-the-motions kind of guy . Few people have ever been as compelled as he is to exude palpable belief in the urgency of everything they do . ( Said Michigan football fan and writer Taylor Fulton in a column on the site Meet at Midfield that was otherwise very critical of the coach ’ s statements about abortion : “ I do not doubt for a moment that Harbaugh and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one got left at his door. ” ) No one , perhaps , can explain exactly why he is this way , but everyone agrees that he … is . “ I ’ ve met John [ his brother ] , and I met Jack Sr. [ his dad ] , and they ’ re pretty normal , ” one person I talked to while researching my book told me . “ Jack Harbaugh is a normal grandpa . Is he a football coach grandpa ? Yes . But he ’ s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way . Jim is just wired so differently , in even his own family. ” Harbaugh thus responds to the tensions between college football ’ s various norms and incentives by ignoring them . He behaves as if , with enough enthusiasm , one can simply do and be everything at once—a world-class football player , a top teenage student , a million-dollar advertising commodity , and a humble servant of the community . What has been emphasized in recent weeks is just how far this all-of-the-above attitude extends in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catholic position on both social justice and abortion with equal seriousness . ( This sort of Catholic used to be much more common in American politics—Joe Biden was one—but has declined at the hands of louder religious political movements . ) He celebrates every interest group—white-collar and blue-collar , radical and traditionalist , bro and feminist . ( Political convictions , I think he believes , should meet on a level playing field in mutually ennobling competition , as football teams do . ) This has ( mostly ) worked for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ’ s given everyone in the program ’ s enormous extended community , including those with no ideological commitments besides winning 10 games a year , something to root for . ( His actual coaching and team management is a lot like his public persona , in that his energy and originality are usually sufficient to make up for his tendency toward the mystifying and the alienating . ) Or , as this guy on Twitter put it : Max S. is right ! Jim Harbaugh is weird , and college football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is appropriate that he should be the main character of Michigan ’ s most recent win over Ohio State , the kind of moment of Sports Emotion that is often described as transcendent . A transcendent moment , after all , must transcend something , whether it be the banal routine of everyday life , or the differences between us . """"""",0

"Coalition governments can be messy affairs. Just look at the state of Italy, where the far right and centre right continue to be uneasy bedfellows. But Italy is far from alone in Europe. In Spain, the task of presenting a united coalition has been made much harder as a result of the Israel-Gaza crisis. While socialist prime minister Pedro Sánchez tries to walk the perilous pathway of supporting Gaza (Spain upped a humanitarian aid package to the Gaza Strip just three days ago) and ceding to Israel’s right to defend itself, the Podemos party – the government’s far-left junior coalition partner – has been far more vocal about the conflict. Earlier this week, its leader, Ione Belarra, suggested that Benjamin Netanyahu should be brought before the International Criminal Court and claimed that other countries were encouraging Israel in its policy of apartheid. Israel responded by accusing Spain of siding with “Isis-style terrorism”. A number of factors are making life difficult for Sánchez. The first is that he is only acting out the role of caretaker as Spain attempts to cobble together a new government. The results of July’s general election have led to a deadlock, with the right-wing People’s Party failing to find enough support to form a majority. The chance now passes to the acting prime minister to see if he can return to power; fresh elections are still a real possibility if the impasse cannot be resolved. And while Podemos has been hard to manage, Sánchez has a host of tricky partners that he needs to keep on his side. The prime minister faces a long list of demands from other parties, including shortening the work week (from upstart coalition partners Sumar) to amnesty for Catalan separatists, whose support he needs to form a new government. Regardless of whether you agree with Belarra’s words – and where your sympathies lie in the Middle East – they are proof of the uphill task facing Spain’s leader as he tries to unite the country. Sánchez will need to dig deep and, potentially, make some concessions that might come back to bite him.",0

"Denouncing “Cold War Liberalism” has recently become a cottage industry on the academic left. Examples of this proliferating genre include a 2021 essay in Dissent, “Legacies of Cold War Liberalism,” by Michael Brenes of Yale and Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins of Wesleyan, and a recent book, Liberalism Against Itself: Cold War Intellectuals and the Making of Our Times, by Samuel Moyn. A fellow historian of Brenes’s at Yale with a joint appointment at the law school, Moyn pronounces his stark judgment early on in his book: “Cold War liberalism was a betrayal of liberalism itself.” “The sins of the children … shouldn’t be visited upon the parents.” It is legitimate to criticize those today who claim to have inherited the mantle of midcentury liberals. These would-be successors position themselves as defenders of liberal democracy against totalitarianism in various new guises, some internal, like wokeness or Trump-style populism, and some foreign, like Russian and Chinese revanchism.

The most critical and surprising finding from the study is that N95 respirators did not significantly outperform “ medical masks. ” The results were based on PCR test for Covid-19 infection and testing for nucleocapsid antibodies ( which reveals exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a vital point for reasons that will be discussed below . In this chart of “ cumulative hazard , ” which is based on a Cox Proportional-Hazards model that displays calculated risk over time , the masks performed similarly . Beyond the cumulative hazard model , a statistical breakdown of the results are provided below . The RT-PCR confirmed Covid-19 infections are charted above . Canada : 6.1 % with medical mask , 2.2 % with N95 . Israel : 35.3 % with Medical Mask , 23.5 % with N95 . Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.1 % with N95 . Egypt : 35 % with medical mask , 38 % with N95 . All sites : 10.46 % with medical mask , 9.27 % with N95 . The disparity in reported cumulative hazard rates can be visualized below . Beyond the results showing no substantial difference between medical masks and N95 masks , there are a few confounding issues . First , there is tremendous variation in reported Covid outbreaks at the sites , which throws into question the perception of overall reduction in hazard from wearing either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , 23 units had “ no outbreaks. ” In Israel , there were outbreaks reported in both facilities . In Pakistan , there were “ no clusters or outbreaks reported. ” And at 6 hospital sites in Egypt , outbreaks were reported over five weeks . In addition to the limited number of outbreaks at these facilities , distorting the efficacy of mask and respirator wearing in higher transmission settings , the participants self-reported very few contacts with Covid-19 positive family and community members . The second confounding issue is universal masking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of droplet-spread SARS-CoV-2 for a limited period of exposure time . But when the virus is aerosolized , masks are not designed to keep the virus from being exhaled through a mask or from penetrating a mask . Thus , the “ solution ” of forcing everyone to wear N95 respirators becomes extremely problematic . N95 respirators are not designed to be worn for long hours each day by the general public . As can be seen from the supplement to the study , there were a number of Adverse Events reported for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were Adverse Events reported for 11 % of all medical mask wearers and 13.6 % for all N95 respirator wearers . These AEs included : Discomfort , skin irritation , and headaches . The researchers ’ conclusion about the study is that the reduction in Covid exposure risk by wearing medical masks or N95 masks is equivocal . “ Among health care workers who provided routine care to patients with COVID-19 , the overall estimates rule out a doubling in hazard of RT-PCR–confirmed COVID-19 for medical masks when compared with HRs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” the researchers concluded . “ The subgroup results varied by country , and the overall estimates may not be applicable to individual countries because of treatment effect heterogeneity. ” Dr. Scott Gottlieb , a Pfizer board member and former FDA Chief , earlier admitted that cloth masks don ’ t work . “ Cloth masks aren ’ t going to provide a lot of protection , that ’ s the bottom line , ” he said . “ This is an airborne illness . We now understand that . And a cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a virus that spreads through airborne transmission . It could protect better through droplet transmission , something like the flu , but not this coronavirus. ” When confronted with the data that the cloth masks don ’ t work , one expert , CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen argued that people be forced to wear surgical masks . “ Leana Wen , public health professor at George Washington University and an emergency physician , has urged the public to wear high-quality masks and described cloth masks as , ‘ little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill reported . “ She said cloth masks should not be considered an acceptable form of face covering and that the U.S. should require and distribute medical-grade surgical masks. ” When Dr. Wen ’ s advice was exposed as misleading , she moved on without missing a beat to argue everyone should wear N95 masks . It ’ s well past time for the CDC to update their mask guidance to recommend N95 , KN95 , or KF94 masks . Covid is airborne . Omicron is extremely contagious . The federal government should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them available free of charge . @ CNNSitRoom pic.twitter.com/bT8pUbCtYm However , we now know the efficacy of N95 masks , especially when worn by the general public , has been grossly exaggerated . This was not the only Randomized Control Trial to test masks . A famous Danish study eventually published in March 2021 at the same journal , the Annals of Internal Medicine , showed that there was no statistically significant difference in Covid risk between wearing a mask and not wearing a mask . The critical thing to note about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as a gauge for mask efficacy . As reported earlier , the Centers for Disease Control and Infection ( CDC ) tracks the seroprevalence of nucleocapsid antibodies that are an indicator of SARS-CoV-2 exposure on its serohub . Serohub shows that as of July 2022 , 97 % of the American public had been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus . This means that it did not matter whether one wore a mask or did not wear a mask , whether one was vaccinated or not vaccinated , whether one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether one was in a lockdown or wasn ’ t in a lockdown , virtually everyone was exposed to the coronavirus during the pandemic… .

""""""" This year , researchers estimate that overall ad spending by political candidates will hit $ 9.7 billion by Election Day in November . Yet , grassroots groups in Georgia trying to mobilize voters for the all-important turnout are so strapped for cash that they are pooling resources . Think on that for a moment : Limited financial support for voter organizing in Georgia , of all places , where Black engagement in two runoff elections in 2020 was the key to Democratic control of the Senate . Political funding habits are hard to break . Donors direct their money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse they believe should win . But this traditional model , supporting campaigns that often direct millions of dollars into ads , isn ’ t enough anymore to put candidates over the finish line or — more importantly — effect the long-term legislative changes we seek to strengthen our society . In an increasingly diverse America , where reaching voters can decide elections and move the needle on crucial issues , why are donors and the Democratic establishment ignoring a winning strategy and under-investing in the grassroots groups that have proven their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done to change how resources are prioritized to ensure an ongoing winning strategy ? We need engagement that transcends single election cycles . When grassroots organizations are properly supported and have the ear of the community , they become trusted messengers that can counter misinformation and sway voters for the long term . We don ’ t have the luxury of pinning our hopes for change on one single election . But the Democratic Party is still relying on charismatic candidates to win voters ’ hearts and minds on their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our eggs in one basket . Former President Obama was a charismatic candidate and president who was well-loved by many . But so was former President Trump . Democrats needs organizations with relationships in communities to register voters , urge them to show up and to constantly remind them of the power of their voice and their vote . In recent years , we ’ ve seen this ongoing expansion of new groups on the scene . And we need them now more than ever , not just for the upcoming midterms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save our democracy . For these organizations to fulfill this mission-critical work , they need financial support . The Democratic Party and candidates can set the example for donors by seeding these groups with funding , showing supporters and voters that grassroots organizations play a pivotal role in elections . Case in point : Rep. Karen Bass ( D-Calif. ) is in a big race for Los Angeles mayor . And while her opponent , a millionaire , can outspend her on ads and the like , Bass , a community activist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the people behind her which gives her a real edge . Creating a fully funded ecosystem focused around inclusive and community-led mobilization will give us a 365-day winning strategy . This ongoing , values-driven movement will live beyond one election cycle to develop the solid base we need for continuous engagement . With an electorate increasingly fired up by grassroots messaging , translating the will of the people into victory at the polls means reaching often overlooked voters where they are . Black voters are essential to winning elections . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Democratic Party in 2020 , Black voters are still seen by some Democratic funders as election participants rather than power brokers . The grassroots organizations engaging the Black electorate are under-funded , lacking the resources they need to overcome the obstacle of new voter suppression laws . Democrats looking for a midterm victory can not afford to overlook these groups , which are key to turning out the Black voters who may decide pivotal races . America ’ s growing diversity is a value add that we need to tap into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fully embrace the needs and wishes of its growing and diverse voting base that is being fueled , in part , by progressive movements for justice and equity . For long-term sustainable change , our approach to elections must be different because our electorate is now different . We are not the same country we were 20 , 15 or even 10 years ago . Black , Hispanic and Asian registered voters historically lean Democratic . And we ’ ve continued to see a rise in these numbers over the years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-larger role in the nation ’ s electorate . Recent election wins by Democrats are rooted in local organizing of a new powerful progressive base . This base includes Black voters working to overcome election restrictions that have long directly them , as well as voters who might have thought themselves moderate but are outraged by the overturning of Roe v. Wade . The Beltway is not America . Grassroots groups are firing up voters with our progressive agenda , pushing moderate Democrats , including President Biden and Congress , to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that energy coming from outside of the Beltway , we need people-centered fundraising efforts that focus on voter priorities and concerns , rather than messages focused on candidates . This shift will direct resources to groups that in turn will convey to voters why casting a ballot matters and the changes they can catalyze by actively participating in our democracy . Yet , Beltway political consultants , who are overwhelmingly white men , are doubling down on establishment politics , advising the party and its candidates to keep it safe by appealing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of voters of color . They also use white-led polling firms and direct obscene amounts of funding to political TV ads , which we know don ’ t have real impact and support mainstream , white media conglomerates . A 2020 Yale study showed that “ regardless of content , context , or audience , those pricey commercials do little to persuade voters. ” Instead , we need more funding in the hands of the people — an approach to voter engagement that has proven results . Coalition-building is the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on-the-ground grassroots organizing and messaging that moves audiences into action . Republicans know this all too well . But we see Democratic funders going back to a funding model that puts money into the hands of individual candidates instead of fueling progressive movements that can reach voters locally . This is despite gains made in the last five years focused on supporting a robust network of groups and organizations doing the heavy lifting of voter engagement , which goes beyond just getting the vote out but building a political infrastructure that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthen our democracy . It ’ s time to challenge traditional funding models to reflect the new and diverse Democratic base and our priorities . When movement and message work together , we win .

Calling McCarthy “a proud conservative with a tireless work ethic,” Stefanik, the upstate New York Congresswoman who serves as the House Republican Conference chair, said she was honored to nominate the California Republican “to lead America’s new Republican majority.” After a protracted 15 rounds of voting, McCarthy finally received the speakership.

There is no elected speaker, with the most recent holder of that title unwillingly reverting to the banal descriptor shared by hundreds of his peers: Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). There’s an acting speaker who fulfills the unwritten rule that all Republican leaders have surnames that begin with “Mc,” but Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.) isn’t seeking election to that role. Instead, the leading contenders are House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). These machinations are interesting in both the historic sense and the obvious sense that they will shape how the chamber runs and what it does. But they are also interesting because the Republican caucus, already more ideologically extreme than any modern caucus, will probably select a leader who is yet more extreme. A caucus riven by pressure applied by the right-wing fringe will hand more power to someone closer to that fringe than McCarthy — or perhaps someone who lives in that fringe.",0

"Listen to this article. The half-bearded behavioral economist Dan Ariely tends to preface discussions of his work—which has inquired into the mechanisms of pain, manipulation, and lies—with a reminder that he comes by both his eccentric facial hair and his academic interests honestly. He tells a version of the story in the introduction to his breezy first book, “Predictably Irrational,” a patchwork of marketing advice and cerebral self-help. One afternoon in Israel, Ariely—an “18-year-old military trainee,” according to the Times—was nearly incinerated. “An explosion of a large magnesium flare, the kind used to illuminate battlefields at night, left 70 percent of my body covered with third-degree burns,” he writes. He spent three years in the hospital, a period that estranged him from the routine practices of everyday life. The nurses, for example, stripped his bandages all at once, as per the cliché. Ariely suspected that he might prefer a gradual removal, even if the result was a greater sum of agony. In an early psychological experiment he later conducted, he submitted this instinct to empirical review. He subsequently found that certain manipulations of an unpleasant experience might make it seem milder in hindsight. In onstage patter, he referred to a famous study in which researchers gave colonoscopy patients either a painful half-hour procedure or a painful half-hour procedure that concluded with a few additional minutes of lesser misery. The patients preferred the latter, and this provided a reliable punch line for Ariely, who liked to say that the secret was to “leave the probe in.” This was not, strictly speaking, optimal—why should we prefer the scenario with bonus pain? But all around Ariely people seemed trapped by a narrow understanding of human behavior. “If the nurses, with all their experience, misunderstood what constituted reality for the patients they cared so much about, perhaps other people similarly misunderstand the consequences of their behaviors,” he writes. “Predictably Irrational,” which was published in 2008, was an instant airport-book classic, and augured an extraordinarily successful career for Ariely as an enigmatic swami of the but-actually circuit. Ariely was born in New York City in 1967 and grew up north of Tel Aviv; his father ran an import-export business. He studied psychology at Tel Aviv University, then returned to the United States for doctoral degrees in cognitive psychology at the University of North Carolina and in business administration at Duke. He liked to say that Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel Prize-winning Israeli American psychologist, had pointed him in this direction. In the previous twenty years, Kahneman and his partner, Amos Tversky, had pioneered the field of “judgment and decision-making,” which revealed the rational-actor model of neoclassical economics to be a convenient fiction. (The colonoscopy study that Ariely loved, for example, was Kahneman’s.) Ariely, a wily character with a vivid origin story, presented himself as the natural heir to this new science of human folly. In 1998, with his pick of choice appointments, he accepted a position at M.I.T. Despite having little training in economics, he seemed poised to help renovate the profession. “In Dan’s early days, he was the most celebrated young intellectual academic,” a senior figure in the discipline told me. “I wouldn’t say he was known for being super careful, but he had a reputation as a serious scientist, and was considered the future of the field.”",0

"IN MID-APRIL, Brad Lander, the comptroller of New York City, appeared on CNBC's Last Call to debate an obscure Republican presidential candidate: investor Vivek Ramaswamy. The topic of the segment was supposed to be electric vehicles. Instead, the two ended up in a television version of fisticuffs over a little-known abbreviation that has become a new bogeyman for the American right in the culture war: ESG. ""I'm frankly worried about the pension fund plan participants in New York City's pension funds,"" Ramaswamy said. His pivot to the topic wasn't surprising: Host Brian Sullivan had introduced him as ""the godfather of anti-ESG."" Ramaswamy had announced his presidential campaign shortly after the launch of his investment firm, Strive Asset Management, which has courted pension funds in Republican states with a pro-oil platform. Ramaswamy wants more, not less, capital to flow into fossil fuels. In his view, ""climate-ism"" is an ideology, and investing in oil companies is a good way to get rich. ""Because you know what? Fossil fuel companies dramatically outperformed the S&P by over 80 percent last year,"" he said. Lander oversees around $240 billion in New York's pension funds, and he has spearheaded a plan to make three of the five funds he manages carbon neutral by 2040. He is one of the most outspoken proponents of sustainable investing. Climate change, he argues, is a critical part of calculating long-term wealth generation, and it is imperative to divest from companies whose business models threaten the future of the planet. This intersection—between an awareness that climate change poses a risk to every industry and the traditional capitalist ethic of growing money through a free market system—is what some call environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing.",0
"Our nation's unique founding is based on a set of principles rooted in the classical liberal tradition. It means that each individual has an inalienable bundle of rights that should be protected from government intrusion. As a result, American conservatives have largely sought to conserve what the rest of the world calls ""liberalism."" Classical liberals defend property rights, strict limits on government authority, and free-market capitalism. They do, however, support a government role in areas such as infrastructure, policing, and national defense. At its root, this is an optimistic philosophy that believes the fruits of liberty are available to all humanity. Ronald Reagan—its most-eloquent modern political proponent—often talked about America as a shining city on the hill. Modern liberals co-opted the word, but their outlook has long been rooted in the progressive tradition, which supports ""the subservience of private individuals, social institutions, and firms to a large, complex state characterized by an extensive and powerful administrative apparatus that is powered by so-called neutral experts,"" as the Classical Liberal Institute explains.",0
"On Tuesday, October 2, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was stripped of his position in a 216-210 vote on a “motion to vacate.” The vote on Tuesday was the culmination of a conflict that has brewed in the U.S. House of Representatives between hard-right Republicans and Representative McCarthy for months. From its beginning, the Speakership of Kevin McCarthy has been a delicate one. Rep. McCarthy was first elected to the post in January after an arduous 15 rounds of voting, making various concessions in order to consolidate the support of several hard-right hold outs. One of those concessions included a one-vote requirement to introduce a motion to vacate, meaning any member could call a vote for McCarthy’s removal at any time. In recent months, various actions by McCarthy have weakened his support among more conservative Republicans. In May, McCarthy worked with Democrats to pass a bipartisan deal to raise the debt ceiling. McCarthy and his supporters touted the deal, which set up spending caps for the next two years, rescinded approximately $28 billion in unspent Covid relief money, and cut $1.4 billion in IRS funding, as “historic.” However, hard-line Republicans such as Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, characterized the deal as Biden stealing McCarthy’s “lunch money.” Rep. Gaetz, who filed the motion to vacate against McCarthy, called this deal the “original sin.”",1

Freeman , a small business owner who went by the name of Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stopped giving out her name in public because of threats she received from Trump supporters . “ I get nervous when I bump into someone I know in the grocery store , ” she said . “ … I get nervous when I have to give my name for food orders . I ’ m always concerned of who ’ s around me . I ’ ve lost my name , and I ’ ve lost my reputation. ” The committee detailed how Trump falsely accused Freeman of being an `` election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a phone call with state officials – nevermind a total lack of evidence , and a total distortion of a video . Freeman 's daughter detailed how those `` lies '' led to death threats against her family . Moss also broke down the false claims about a video showing the two women at work on election night in Fulton County . To wit : Trump 's attorney , Giuliani , claimed the video showed the two women exchanging a USB drive full of bogus votes . It was not a USB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ginger mint . After being targeted by Trump and his allies for debunked claims of election fraud in Georgia , Moss says her life was turned “ upside down. ” Moss told the committee she no longer gives out her business card and she doesn ’ t want “ anyone knowing my name. ” She also doesn ’ t go out anymore with her mom “ because she might yell my name over the grocery aisle or something . I do n't go to the grocery store at all. ” “ I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I gained about 60 pounds . I don ’ t do nothing anymore , I don ’ t want to go anywhere . I second guess everything that I do , ” said Moss , almost tearing up . “ It ’ s affected my life in a major way . Every way . All because of lies. ” Moss described the social media attacks she received after Trump ’ s allies circulated a video falsely accusing her of election fraud . “ There were just a lot of horrible things there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of threats , wishing death upon me , telling me I ’ ll be in jail with my mother. ” Moss , who worked in Fulton County , Ga. , said she had never experienced anything like that in her more than ten years as an election worker . Fulton County election official and her mother targeted with “ nasty lies ” An election worker who helped process voter registrations , absentee ballot requests , and the votes “ became the target of nasty lies spread by President Trump and his allies ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D-Miss. , said in the hearing . Moss worked in Fulton County ’ s Department of Registration and Elections from 2017 to 2022 . Her mother , Ruby Freeman , also suffered from the disinformation campaign . Thompson called the two women “ unsung heroes ” who keep democracy functioning . Trump continued to promote fraud allegations on Jan. 6 , four days after Raffensperger told him the allegations were false . Trump claimed that the Georgia secretary of state and the attorney general were lying . His claims included how Fulton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room after a water main burst and how election officials pulled suitcases of ballots out from under a table and illegally scanned them . “ Tens of thousands of votes . This act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100,000 votes for Joe Biden . Almost none for Trump . Oh , that sounds fair , ” Trump said in a clip from his Jan. 6 speech , which was played during the hearing . Trump pushed a conspiracy theory in a phone call with Raffensperger that 18,000 ballots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Georgia , a baseless conspiracy that a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor later dismissed . Gabriel Sterling , the chief operating officer in Raffensperger ’ s office , said his office had an observer in Fulton County who was present for the counting of about 8,900 votes from the time he showed up to the time he left , a number “ way below 18,000. ” Additionally , Sterling said there would have been no physical way to know who each of those ballots were for , and said the “ suitcases ” in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow for seals to be put on so they ’ ll be tamper-proof. ” ‘ We didn ’ t have any votes to find , ’ Raffensperger says Raffensperger testified about a phone conversation in which Trump urged him to “ find ” votes to overturn his election loss . But , “ we didn ’ t have any votes to find , ” Raffensperger said , adding that votes had been counted accurately and that the vote totals had been certified . Raffensperger also disputed Trump ’ s claims that ballots had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shredding of ballots , ” he said . Raffensperger disputed former Trump ’ s claim that thousands of votes were cast in Georgia by dead people . The state ’ s review found only four instances of votes cast in the name of people who were deceased , Raffensperger testified . He also rejected Trump ’ s claim that a lot of votes were “ dropped ” late at night . Raffensperger said all ballots had to be accepted by 7 p.m. Trump to Georgia investigator : ‘ Whatever you can do ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances Watson who was supervising the audit process in Georgia . “ Whatever you can do Frances , it would be , it ’ s a great thing . It ’ s an important thing for the country , so important . You have no idea , so important and I very much appreciate it , ” Trump told Watson in a taped phone call played during the hearing . Schiff said the select committee received text messages that found Mark Meadows wanted to send Georgia investigators “ POTUS-stuff ” including coins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other items . White House staff intervened before items could be sent . Attorney General Bill Barr and a top prosecutor in Georgia testified by video that allegations of election fraud in Georgia were false . Barr said he told Trump that allegations of vote counters in Fulton County pulling ballots out of a suitcase and scanned them were untrue . “ We took a hard look at this ourselves , ” Barr said . “ And based on our review of it , including the review of key witnesses , the Fulton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia U.S. Attorney BJay Pak , who resigned over Trump ’ s efforts to overturn the election , testified that he reviewed a videotape purportedly showing the fraud . “ There was nothing there , ” he said . Raffensperger disputed Trump 's claim to Watson that he had won the election . Asked by Schiff about the accuracy of the claim , Raffensperger said “ No he did not. ” “ What happened in fall of 2020 is that 28,000 Georgians skipped the presidential race and yet they voted downballot in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican congressman ended up getting 33,000 more votes than President Trump . And that ’ s why President Trump came up short. ” Trump told Georgia investigator she would “ be praised ” for calling election for him In a call to Watson , Trump pressured Watson to investigate his false claims of voter fraud in Georgia and call the election in his favor . Trump told Watson that he won by “ hundreds of thousands of votes , it wasn ’ t even close , ” and that the Georgia voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for Biden . “ When the right answer comes out , you ’ ll be praised … because everyone knows it ’ s wrong , there ’ s no way , ” Trump told Watson . Georgia official : Answering Trump 's lies was like a 'shovel trying to empty the ocean' A Georgia election official told the committee how frustrating it was to answer Trump 's repeated lies about alleged voter fraud in Georgia . It was like `` a shovel trying to empty the ocean , '' said Gabriel Sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary of state 's office . In speeches and social media , Trump kept claiming fraud in Georgia , even though GOP state officials repeatedly told him there was no credible evidence for his claims . Sterling said millions of Trump 's fans , including members of his own family , simply refused to believe that evidence : `` Once you get past the heart , the facts do n't matter as much . '' Sterling said actions by vote counters that became the basis for conspiracy theories were , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most frustrating claims , Sterling testified , was about the “ suitcases of ballots ” that Trump allies said were pulled out from under a table after election monitors had been kicked out . Sterling said that , in full view of election monitors , the vote counters had put uncounted ballots in tamper-proof containers because they had thought they were done for the night . They then were told to continue processing those ballots . But the conspiracy theories , Sterling said , took on a life of their own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Georgia official Sterling said he made a public plea for Trump to stop inspiring people to commit acts of violence after he saw a young staffer for Dominion Voting Systems was being threatened online by QAnon supporters . Sterling said he received a call from a “ pretty unflappable ” Dominion staffer who was “ audibly shaken ” by the threats against the staffer . Sterling said he saw the man ’ s name trending on Twitter along with a picture of a noose that said , “ You committed treason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” Sterling said he lost his temper to the point he got red in the face . That inspired him to say to Trump via a press conference , “ Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence . Someone ’ s going to get hurt . Someone ’ s going to get shot . Someone ’ s going to get killed . And it ’ s not right. ” Members trapped in the chamber and officers injured on Jan. 6 in audience Democratic Reps. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania and Veronica Escobar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped in the gallery on Jan. 6 — are watching today 's proceedings in the hearing room . U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn , D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges , U.S. Capitol Police Sgt . Aquilino Gonell , and D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone are also watching in the room . The officers were charged with protecting the Capitol on Jan. 6 and have been attending the hearings . House Chaplain Margaret G. Kibben is also present . Kibben was in her third day on the job on Jan. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as members donned escape hoods . Michigan official : GOP electors planned to hide in state Capitol The committee played a video of testimony by a former Michigan Republican official who told of a plot by GOP electors planning to hide in the state Capitol . Laura Cox , the former leader of Michigan ’ s Republican Party , recalled a conversation with a man who told her he was working with Trump ’ s re-election campaign . “ He told me that the Michigan Republican electors were planning to meet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could fulfill the role of casting their vote ” in the Michigan legislative chambers , Cox said . “ I told him in no uncertain terms that that was insane and inappropriate , ” Cox said . Bowers describes influx of calls , emails and protesters at his home Bowers said he received over 20,000 emails and tens of thousands of voicemails and texts following the 2020 election . The influx of emails and calls made it challenging for his office to work and communicate , he said . “ At home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new pattern or a pattern in our lives to worry what will happen on Saturdays because we have various groups come by , ” Bowers said . Bowers described how individuals visit his home playing videos and blaring loudspeakers claiming that he is corrupt and a pedophile . Bowers said protests outside his home continued until recently , with groups accusing him of pedophilia and perversion , and arguing with his neighbors . At least one protester brought a pistol , Bowers said . “ There was one gentleman who had the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pistol and was threatening my neighbor – not with the pistol , but just vocally , ” Bowers said . “ When I saw the gun , I knew I had to get close. ” Bowers said the `` disturbing ' protests upset his daughter , who was gravely ill , and his wife . Bowers was not aware at the time when a group of fake electors cast electoral votes for Trump and sent them to Washington , D.C. , for certification . When he learned of the scheme , Bowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gang that Couldn ’ t Shoot Straight . '' `` And I just thought this is a tragic parody , ” Bowers told the committee . He read to the committee his personal journal he kept in December 2020 , a month before the Capitol attack . “ It is painful to have friends who have been such a help to me , turn on me with such rancor , ” Bowers wrote . “ I do not want to be a winner by cheating . I will not play with laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers backed away from alternate electors As Trump ’ s legal challenges to the election repeatedly failed , Trump campaign lawyers no longer wanted to pursue alternate slates of electors , according to testimony the committee aired . Justin Clark , one of the campaign lawyers , said he told others that convening electors in states Trump lost was not appropriate unless litigation was pending . Matt Morgan , another campaign lawyer , said he took his responsibility in the scheme “ to zero. ” Cassidy Hutchinson — who was a top aide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mark Meadows — said she participated in a meeting during which the White House counsel ’ s office said the law did not support the plan for alternate electors . Meadows and Giuliani were also at that meeting , according to Hutchinson . Sen. Ron Johnson attempted to give fake elector documents to Pence ahead of Jan. 6 Text messages obtained by the committee show that Sen. Ron Johnson , R-Wisc. , wanted to hand-deliver fake elector votes from Michigan and Wisconsin to Pence . A staff member for Johnson sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes before the beginning of the joint session , but Pence ’ s aide , Chris Hodgson , instructed Johnson ’ s aide to not give Pence the alternate slate of electors.. Trump aide : Staff members felt like 'useful idiots ' and 'rubes ' over fake elector scheme The committee played video of a former Trump staff member talking about the anger he and others felt over the `` fake elector '' scheme that even campaign attorneys would n't stand behind . `` We were useful idiots – just rubes at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee . Sinners also said that no Trump officials `` really cared '' if aides like him were putting themselves at legal risk . Even after batting down requests from Trump ’ s inner circle to overturn the election , Bowers said he received a pressuring call from the then-chairman of the Freedom Caucus . Rep. Andy Biggs , R-Ariz. , called Bowers on Nov. 30 — the day Arizona was supposed to formally award the state ’ s electoral votes to Biden — to ask if Bowers would sign a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official electors , Bowers testified Tuesday . Bowers described for the committee a Jan. 4 , 2021 , call with one of Trump ’ s lawyers where he refused to reject the state ’ s electors for Biden . Bowers said the lawyer , John Eastman , suggested the legislature take the action and allow courts to sort out the dispute . But Bowers reacted incredulously and refused , telling Eastman it would violate his oath of office . “ You ’ re asking me to do something that ’ s never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States –and I ’ m going to put my state through that without sufficient proof ? And that ’ s going to be good enough with me , that I would put us through that , my state , that I swore to uphold both in Constitution and in law ? ” Bowers said . “ No sir. ” Arizona official on violating constitutional oath : ‘ I will not do it ’ Bowers cited his religious faith as one of the reasons he would not grant Giuliani ’ s request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace them with electors for Trump . Bowers said it is a tenet of his faith that the Constitution is divinely inspired . Bowers said he was concerned that Giuliani would ask him to violate his oath to uphold the Constitution without offering any “ strong judicial quality evidence ” of election fraud . “ For me to do that , because somebody just asked me to do it , is foreign to my being , ” he said . “ I will not do it. ” Schiff said the select committee uncovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Proud Boys involved in the Jan. 6 attack participated in `` stop the steal '' protests at state capitals . One of the protests took place at the Arizona House of Representatives building where protestors called for Bowers by name and stood outside the door armed with rifles . Protesters illegally entered the building and refused to leave , Schiff said . One protester at the Arizona House building , “ QAnon Shaman '' Jacob Chansley , was sentenced to 41 months in prison after breaching the Capitol on Jan. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of fraud , Bowers says Giuliani wanted Arizona to hold an official hearing to certify Trump as the winner because he claimed over 200,000 undocumented individuals and 6,000 dead people had voted in the election , Bowers testified . On multiple occasions , Bowers and other senators pushed Giuliani and other Trump attorneys for names of individuals and evidence of fraud , but Giuliani never provided evidence . “ We ’ ve got lots of theories , we just don ’ t have the evidence , ” Giuliani told them . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a gaffe or maybe he didn ’ t think through what he said , but both myself and others in my group and my counsel remembered that specifically and kind of laughed about it , ” Bowers said . Arizona Republican : Could not replace Biden electors with Trump electors Bowers told the committee he adamantly told Trump and his aides that he could not ask his state legislature to simply award him electoral votes after Trump lost the the state 's popular vote to Biden . The idea of even considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Bowers testified , and he would n't have it . Bowers said he told Trump 's team : `` You are asking me to do something that is counter to my oath , '' as well as `` to the laws of the state of Arizona . '' Bowers : ' I didn ’ t want to be used as a pawn' Bowers said he refused Giuliani ’ s request to hold a hearing on evidence of election fraud – evidence that Bowers said Giuliani never provided . “ I refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn ’ t want to be used as a pawn. ” Bowers said the “ circus had been brewing ” with lots of demonstrations about the election results “ and I didn ’ t want to have that in the House. ” Arizona official says he asked Giuliani repeatedly for proof of fraud Bowers said he asked Giuliani repeatedly for proof of election fraud but did not receive it . Bowers said he was on the phone with Trump and Giuliani when Giuliani began listing off large numbers of people who voted but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undocumented immigrants and dead people — when he asked , “ Do you have their names ? ” Bowers said Giuliani told him “ yes ” and that Trump told Giuliani to give him what he wanted . Bowers said he “ never ” received the information he asked for despite asking for the information “ on multiple occasions. ” Bowers opened his testimony by directly denying a claim Tuesday by former Trump that Bowers said the 2020 election was rigged . Trump had issued a statement minutes before Bowers ’ appearance saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 2020 , saying Bowers called the election rigged . Bowers , who campaigned with Trump , confirmed having a conversation with Trump , but said parts the former president cited were untrue . Bowers also denied Trump ’ s claim that he won Arizona instead of Biden . “ That is also false , ” Bowers said . Pennsylvania House Speaker Bryan Cutler received daily voicemails from Trump ’ s lawyers in the last week of November . “ Hey Brian , it ’ s Rudy . I really have something important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think changes things , ” Giuliani said in a taped voicemail played during the hearing . Cutler asked his lawyers to have Giuliani stop calling , but the calls continued . He said there were multiple protests at his house and district office following . His personal email , cell phone and home phone number were shared online . “ We had to disconnect our home phone for about three days because it would ring all hours of the night and fill up with messages , ” Cutler said . Schiff : Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence and death. ” Schiff said Trump 's intense pressure campaign against state election officials “ brought angry phone calls , and texts , armed protests , intimidation , and all too often , threats of violence and death. ” The pressure campaign singled out specific elections officials and workers . The Jan. 6 committee played a video of pro-Trump protestors chanting “ stop the steal ” outside Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson ’ s house . Protesters called Benson a `` tyrant '' and a `` felon . '' Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the fear . Are they coming with guns ? Are they gon na attack my house ? I ’ m in here with my kid , you know , I ’ m trying to put them to bed . And so that was the scariest moment , just not knowing what was going to happen. ” Trump used “ escalating campaign of pressure ” in battleground states : Schiff In his opening remarks to the committee , Schiff spoke of the layers of pressure Trump put on election commissioners and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pressuring states to stop the counting of votes on Election Day . Then he put more pressure on officials who refused to certify him as winner of states he lost . When state elected officials refused to go back into session to appoint Trump electors , Trump further “ amped up the pressure , yet again ” Schiff said . “ Anyone who got in the way of Trump ’ s continued hold on power after he lost the election was the subject of a dangerous and escalating campaign of pressure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and texts , armed protests , intimidation , and all too often , threats of violence and death , ” Schiff said . Trump did not care about threats of violence , Cheney says Cheney said former Trump did not care that his false allegations of election fraud were leading to threats of violence . “ Donald Trump did not care about the threats of violence , ” Cheney said . “ He did not condemn them . He made no effort to stop them . He went forward with his fake allegations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings to focus on the evidence and not be distracted by politics . “ This is serious , ” she said . “ We can not let America become a nation of conspiracy theories and thug violence. ” In her opening statement , Cheney , R-Wyo. , said Trump 's pressure on officials in Georgia , Arizona , and other states to reverse his election losses to Biden should be deplored by everybody – including Justice Department investigators . `` Each of these efforts to overturn the election is independently serious , '' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both by Congress and by the Department of Justice . '' The Justice Department is already prosecuting rioters who breached the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 , 2021 – Cheney and other committee members clearly want prosecutors to include Trump himself in their investigation . Trump ’ s false claims of election fraud continue to reverberate in contests held after the 2020 presidential campaign , Thompson said . “ The lie hasn ’ t gone away . It ’ s corrupting our democratic institutions , ” Thompson said . “ People who believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public trust. ” He cited the recent primary election in New Mexico where a county commissioner refused to certify the results based on a “ gut feeling ” about the voting machines . That same commissioner is among those who pleaded guilty to illegally entering the Capitol on Jan. 6 , Thompson said . Thompson said Trump not only knew state election officials would be threatened with violence for not overturning the election results in his favor , but that he amplified those threats . “ When they wouldn ’ t embrace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the voters with Donald Trump ’ s will to remain in power , Donald Trump worked to ensure they faced the consequences , ” Thompson said , referring to state election officials . “ Threats to people ’ s livelihood and lives , ” he said . “ Threats of violence that Donald Trump knew about and amplified. ” Thompson : Trump pressure on states ‘ part of the playbook ’ Thompson , the committee chairman , opened Tuesday ’ s hearing by reciting evidence from previous hearings about Trump ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overturn the 2020 election , but the scheme didn ’ t end there . Thompson , D-Miss. , said state officials from Georgia and Arizona would describe the pressure on them . “ In fact , pressuring public servants into betraying their oaths was a fundamental part of the playbook , ” Thompson said . “ A handful of election officials in key states stood between Donald Trump and the upending of American democracy. ” Trump called Bowers a “ Republican in name only ” before the lawmaker is scheduled to testify Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his state ’ s election results . Bowers has said Trump and his lawyer , Giuliani , called to urge him to overturn his state ’ s electors for Biden and replace them with electors for Trump . But Trump said Bowers thanked him in November 2020 for getting him elected and that Trump won the election . “ During the conversation , he told me that the election was rigged and that I won Arizona , ” Trump said in a statement . “ He said he got more votes than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British documentarian provides committee more video of Trump , Pence A British documentarian said Tuesday he provided the House Jan. 6 committee with previously unreleased recordings of exclusive interviews with Trump , his children and former Vice President Mike Pence before and after the Capitol attack Jan. 6 , 2021 . Alex Holder said in a tweeted statement he began the project in September 2020 and hadn ’ t expected the recordings to be subpoenaed . “ We simply wanted to better understand who the Trumps were and what motivated them to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holder , who has a deposition with the committee scheduled Thursday . The recordings are scheduled to be part of a three-part series to be released this summer called , “ Unprecedented. ” Donald Trump hits Kevin McCarthy over lack of Trump Republicans on Jan. 6 committee Trump is now attacking House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy over the lack of pro-Trump Republicans in the Jan. 6 committee hearings on the Capitol attack . `` It was a bad decision not to have representation on that committee , '' Trump told conservative radio talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . `` That was a very , very foolish decision because they try to pretend like they 're legit , and only when you get into the inner workings , you say , 'What kind of a thing is this ?

But current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , rejected GOP firebrands Jim Jordan and Jim Banks because they voted against the electoral vote count that elected Biden . What we learned at earlier hearings • June 9 hearing : Committee members gave an overview of what they called former Trump 's `` sophisticated seven-part plan '' to overturn the 2020 election . Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards described suffering a concussion and slipping in blood while battling rioters . British documentarian Nick Quested played video of a meeting between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the attack . • June 13 hearing : The committee outlined how Trump 's aides on the campaign and at the White House told him repeatedly he lost the 2020 election . Former Attorney General Bill Barr called the allegations of election fraud `` completely bogus and silly '' in videotaped testimony . A committee member , Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D-Calif. , called Trump raising $ 250 million after the election to fight election fraud `` a big rip-off '' because most of the money went to a campaign fund unrelated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The hearing focused on Trump 's pressure on Vice President Mike Pence to reject electors from key states and overturn the election for him . Retired federal judge Michael Luttig , who advised Pence , told the committee there was no constitutional basis for Trump 's strategy . `` None , '' Luttig said . Videotaped testimony from a series of Trump aides including his daughter , Ivanka Trump , described a Jan. 6 call between Trump and Pence as `` heated '' and said the president called his vice president a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates hoping to knock off Raffensperger and Georgia Gov . Brian Kemp , but both incumbents won . The campaign became a proxy fight between Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence , who supported the incumbents . But other Trump candidates , including Jim Marchant , who won the GOP nomination for Nevada secretary of state , have said they wouldn ’ t have certified 2020 election results that Biden won .

After Trump and his supporters falsely accused Moss of processing fake ballots for Biden , Moss received so many death threats and racist taunts , she changed her appearance and went into hiding , according to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum , which gave her a 2022 `` Profile in Courage Award . '' Bowers and the committee vice chair , Cheney , also received the award . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jan. 2 , 2021 , call from Trump urging Georgia Secretary of State Brian Raffensperger to “ find ” 11,780 votes for him to beat Biden in Georgia . Trump insisted he couldn ’ t have lost the state , but Raffensperger told him what he was saying “ was not true ” during the call , which was recorded . Sterling publicly called Trump 's claims false . Thompson , the committee chairman , said Trump tried everything in his power to change the election results . `` He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the election in their states , but they refused , '' Thompson said . What we know about today 's hearing : Jan. 6 hearings resume Tuesday with a focus on Trump 's pressure on state officials . What to expect . Trump continued to maintain in a statement Sunday his call to Georgia officials was `` appropriate . '' In a separate statement , he again called the investigation a hoax and a waste of time . `` My phone call to the Georgia Secretary of State , with many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the line , was absolutely PERFECT and appropriate , '' Trump said . Jan. 6 committee hearing schedule : Here 's what to expect about at upcoming Jan. 6 hearings Testimony from the Arizona House Speaker , Rusty Bowers , is important because the state was one of seven key states that President Joe Biden won in 2020 , but Trump and his allies tried to overturn . Bowers said he got a call in late November 2020 from Trump and his lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , urging the lawmaker to submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused . Another Trump lawyer , John Eastman , argued states could submit alternate slates of electors from the ones that were officially certified , so Vice President Mike Pence could reject their Biden electors , according to earlier testimony and court records . Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark drafted a letter to six of the states urging legislative leaders to overturn their official results , according to court records . `` We 'll show during the hearing what the president 's role was in trying to get states to name alternate slates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially on hopes that the legislators would reconvene and bless it , '' Schiff told CNN 's `` State of the Union '' on Sunday . What happened on Day 3 : Trump called Pence a 'wimp ' as VP resisted 'pressure campaign ' to overturn election The committee asked Virginia `` Ginni '' Thomas , the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas , for an interview because of emails she sent Bowers and texts she sent former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to fight the election results . `` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what her involvement was in this plot to overturn the election , '' Schiff told CNN .

""""""" Ronna McDaniel , the chair of the Republican National Committee , on Sunday said GOP candidates running in this week ’ s midterm elections will ultimately accept the results after exploring all the options available to them . “ Every election is run differently at the county level , at the precinct level , ” McDaniel told CNN ’ s “ State of the Union. ” “ So we want to make sure it ’ s run fair and transparently . And then we will let the process play out , and then we will accept the results. ” Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the results outright . “ I sure hope I can , but I can ’ t predict what the Democrats might have planned , ” said Sen. Ron Johnson ( Wis. ) , who has been considered one of the most vulnerable Senate Republicans and is running a tight race against Democrat challenger Lt. Gov . Mandela Barnes . “ You know , we ’ re not trying to do anything to gain partisan advantage . We ’ re just doing whatever we can to restore confidence . It sure seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the past , a lot of attempts on the part of Democrats to make it easier to cheat. ” McDaniel defended Johnson ’ s comments , also citing examples of Democrats whom she described as using language that is “ not helpful. ” McDaniel referred to Stacey Abrams , the Democratic candidate for Georgia governor who acknowledged Brian Kemp ’ s win in the state ’ s 2018 gubernatorial race but did not concede , citing voter suppression , and Hillary Clinton who recently said “ right-wing extremists already have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election. ” “ If there ’ s real problems , everyone should be able to address that , ” McDaniel said . “ And I think Ron Johnson and Stacey Abrams , in the end , once all their avenues are exhausted , right , they will — they will accept the results. ” McDaniel has appeared on Steve Bannon ’ s podcast to help recruit poll watchers .

But poll watching is not intimidating. ” Many Republicans have been motivated by the conspiracy movie “ 2000 Mules ” to hold stakeouts at drop boxes and mobilize around former President Donald Trump ’ s lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him . McDaniel also deflected a question about whether she would like to see Trump declare a 2024 presidential run soon . “ I ’ m only focused on 2022 , ” she said . “ I don ’ t even know what I ’ m doing for Thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2024. ” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated .

His remarks came two weeks after five railway maintenance workers were killed by a passing train in the northern Italian town of Brandizzo.

"The local and regional elections that will take place on October 8 – and the 15th for runoffs – were supposed to be of limited importance, following the ruling conservative New Democracy’s triumph in the May and June national elections. Successive natural disasters – wildfires in August and floods in September – along with the election of an unconventional political neophyte as opposition leader have added more than a dose of suspense. Will the government be punished for its management of the disasters? Will the new left-wing SYRIZA party leader excite the voters? New Democracy controls 11 of 13 of Greece’s regions; in one, the North Aegean, the incumbent is a conservative dissenter; and in Crete, a former socialist lawmaker is running as the heavy favorite to win a fourth term. In 2019, Stavros Arnaoutakis was backed by SYRIZA and the socialist PASOK. This time, New Democracy, opting for the “if you can’t beat them, join them” strategy, has decided to endorse him, while SYRIZA is running its own candidate.",0

"Germany did the right thing by funding private rescue operations for migrants in the Mediterranean. Ricarda Lang, leader of the ruling Greens, insisted on Monday, rejecting complaints from the opposition and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Last week, Italian media reported that Meloni had written a letter to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, accusing Germany of encouraging migration through state funding of NGOs. Meloni’s comments even received backing from Johann Wadephul, a senior centre-right opposition CDU/CSU MP, who this weekend called her “anger” “justified” and claimed that “German taxpayers’ money should not be spent to fund the business of inhumane people smugglers”. “What’s happening here is that human lives are being saved, and that’s the right thing to do.

""""""" This has been a year of watershed moments in real estate , and not the good kind . The Housing Market Index , a closely watched industry metric that gauges the outlook for home sales , declined to 33 in November on a hundred-point scale , its lowest level in a decade , save for the first dystopian month of the pandemic . Anything under 50 spells trouble . A month earlier , interest rates on a standard 30-year mortgage passed 7 percent , capping the largest single-year increase in at least 50 years . “ Just to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve come , we started the year around 3 percent , ” said Michael Fratantoni , chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association . “ It has just been a wild ride. ” The difference between a 3 percent interest rate and a 7 percent rate amounts to $ 1,000 more in a monthly mortgage payment on a mid-priced American home , according to Nadia Evangelou , senior economist at the National Association of Realtors . Interest rates have retreated to 6.3 percent this month , seeding fresh hope for the few remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After an unprecedented campaign of rate hikes , Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank will ease up . That ’ s one reason mortgage rates are ticking down . The other is more sobering . “ We , others , many market participants are forecasting a recession in the United States and many other places around the world , ” Fratantoni said . “ That puts downward pressure on the rates. ” The housing market is already in recession and has been since midsummer , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishes the Housing Market Index with Wells Fargo . “ The index has declined for 11 straight months , ” said Robert Dietz , chief economist for the homebuilders group . “ This is going to be the first calendar year in 11 years where single-family starts , ” a measure of new home construction , “ will total a smaller volume than the prior year. ” He predicts a double-digit decline . Where the housing market goes , the broader economy follows . Dietz , Fratantoni and others in the industry expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of economic malaise generally defined as two successive quarters of decline . “ The housing market leads the U.S. into recession , and it ’ s likely to pull it out , ” Fratantoni said , with recovery arriving around the middle of next year . And what does all this mean for homeowners ? For most : Staying put . The vast majority of homeowners are blessed with fixed-rate mortgages secured at historically low interest rates , under 4 percent . There ’ s little incentive to sell . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mortgage before the middle of this year is in really good shape , ” Fratantoni said . A small percentage of homeowners , around 1 in 10 , may be in trouble . They hold adjustable-rate mortgages that will shortly adjust to current rates , if they haven ’ t already . “ Those people are gon na get hit , ” said Steven Carvell , professor of finance at Cornell University . In the years before the Great Recession of 2008 , adjustable-rate mortgages made up as much as 35 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbled , many borrowers owed as much as their home was worth , if not more . Economists expect no such meltdown in 2023 . Nearly half of all current mortgages are “ equity rich ” : The borrowers owe less than half of what their home is worth , according to ATTOM , a real-estate analyst . Things could get ugly if home prices plummet . But economists don ’ t expect that to happen in the current downturn . “ To be sure , we ’ re going to see an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . “ But we ’ re not expecting it anywhere on the scale of last time. ” More than 6 million families lost their homes to foreclosure in the Great Recession . That slump followed years of overbuilding , Dietz said , yielding a housing surplus and plummeting home values . Recent years , by contrast , have seen “ a tremendous amount of underbuilding , ” he said , leaving a deficit of available housing . Mortgage delinquency rates , a measure of looming foreclosures , stand at historic lows , Fratantoni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fratantoni said , “ if you have an owner who sees the market weakening , they just pull their property off the market. ” The Fed raised interest rates , in part , to seed a “ correction ” in an overheated housing market . Home prices rose more than 40 percent from the beginning of 2020 to June 2022 , according to the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index . It worked . The index has declined for three consecutive months , the steepest dip in a decade . Home prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago , but that could change . Redfin , the real estate brokerage , predicts prices will decline by 4 percent in 2023 , to a median value of $ 368,000 . “ This doesn ’ t necessarily mean that everyone ’ s home value is starting to decline , ” said Daryl Fairweather , chief economist for Redfin . “ Luxury homes will decline in price the most . Affordable homes will likely maintain their value a bit better. ” A Redfin analysis suggests home prices may hold up better in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values rose less dramatically in the pandemic years . Prices could fall farther in pandemic boomtowns such as Phoenix ; Austin , Texas ; and Boise , Idaho . Housing analysts expect a much steeper decline in home sales : a 15 percent drop in 2022 and a 7 percent decline in 2023 , according to the National Association of Realtors . “ We saw a record share of houses being taken off the market in the last 12 weeks , ” Fairweather said . Prospective sellers “ are not willing to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the home and wait. ” For the nation ’ s real estate agents and home sellers , “ last year was the best year since 2006 , ” Evangelou said . This year is one of the worst . Interview requests by The Hill to several prominent real estate agents on Monday went unanswered or were politely declined . One Chicago agent explained in an email that her sellers “ are mostly waiting to list until next year. ” Buyers are suffering , too , buffeted by high interest rates , inflated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes for sale . First-time homebuyers face particularly steep odds . They can not tap a reservoir of equity to finance a large down payment . Rents have risen , complicating the task of saving any down payment . First-time buyers now make up only 26 percent of all home purchasers , the lowest share in recent years , according to a national survey by the National Association of Realtors . As 2022 turns to 2023 , all eyes will be trained on interest rates . Many observers say the highest rates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has them peaking around 7 1/2 percent , ” Dietz said . But Redfin forecasts rates will eventually decline , sliding to 5.8 percent by the end of 2023 . At a 5.8 percent interest rate , a prospective buyer with a $ 2,500 monthly budget could afford a $ 406,250 home . At a 6.5 percent rate , the same buyer could spend only $ 383,750 .

""""""" The latest round of Medicaid expansion negotiations comes as states prepare for the eventual end of the Covid-19 public health emergency , which helped millions of people stay on Medicaid during the pandemic , and as nearly a third of rural hospitals are at risk of closure , two factors Medicaid experts believe could persuade conservative lawmakers . In Wyoming , for example , some Republicans , worried about the state ’ s changing economy and hospital closures , are attempting to pass expansion legislation , which died last year after advancing in the state House but not the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower the uninsured rate by expanding who is eligible for Medicaid with the federal government picking up most of the tab . But the Supreme Court ruled that states are not obligated to participate , and most Republican-controlled states refused to do so . Citizen-led ballot initiatives forced red states such as Missouri , Oklahoma and , most recently , South Dakota , to expand Medicaid , leaving 11 states without an expansion program . Policy experts who closely follow Medicaid expansion efforts believe North Carolina has the best chance to be next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican legislative leadership is on board with the proposal after years of opposition . “ If there ’ s a person in North Carolina in public office who ’ s spoken more in opposition to Medicaid expansion than me , I would like to meet that person , ” said North Carolina Senate leader Phil Berger , who is now pushing for Medicaid expansion . “ I came to the position that expansion is something we should be in favor of and something we probably need to do. ” Still , legislation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 600,000 people did not pass this year amid disagreements over changes to the state ’ s certificate of need laws , which regulate health care expansions and acquisitions , and allowing advanced practice registered nurses to practice independently — two policies Berger believes should be approved at the same time as Medicaid expansion . Cooper and Republican House leaders have said the issues are separate . “ Republican leadership continues to say to me that they support Medicaid expansion , that they want Medicaid expansion , and that it ’ s going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the longer we go , that inaction will show otherwise , ” Cooper said . In Kansas , Democratic Gov . Laura Kelly , fresh off winning a second term , is taking another swing at Medicaid expansion , which she pushed in each of her first four years . Kansas appeared on the cusp of a deal in 2020 but talks broke down when the issue became entangled in a separate debate over abortion restrictions . The following year , Kelly proposed legalizing medical marijuana and using the tax revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also failed . And in 2022 , efforts similarly fell flat . “ There have been a handful of powerful legislators who have been able to really stop the progress of expansion over the years , ” said April Holman , executive director of the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas , a group that supports Medicaid expansion . “ I am hopeful that some of the political gamesmanship that was happening particularly during the pandemic — and even last session — will dissipate now that the election is over and we can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelly ’ s chief of staff , said the governor plans to introduce a bill in both chambers and tour the state talking about Medicaid expansion , which would cover 150,000 people . He said he ’ s “ optimistic that we ’ ll get something done ” with the governor entering her second and final term and Republicans less concerned about giving her political wins that would factor into a reelection campaign . “ Obviously there ’ s been a lot of opposition , but , at a certain point , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ’ s a need to do something on the members of both chambers . Leadership has to think about that , ” Lawrence told POLITICO . “ It ’ s really hard when you ’ re a legislator and you ’ ve got the governor in your district talking about an issue that ’ s important to a lot of people in your district — especially in rural places where hospitals are closing. ” But to pass expansion , Kelly will have to overcome stalwart opposition from Republican legislative leaders , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veto-proof supermajorities . “ Laura Kelly won re-election with less than 50 percent of the vote because of a split in the Republican electorate who wants bold leadership like we ’ ve seen out of Florida and in other states , ” Masterson told POLITICO . “ Nowhere in the election was there a message to lurch to the left or grow government by expanding Obamacare and making people more dependent on programs. ” Legislative observers believe passing Medicaid expansion next year will likely take some sort of significant dealmaking between the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he didn ’ t have “ a good answer at the moment ” on what the governor would be willing to negotiate to get Medicaid expansion . “ Right now we know there ’ s not really a path to move forward because we ’ re in a similar place where we have been , really , with legislative leadership the same , and the governor the same , ” said Cindy Samuelson , a senior vice president at the Kansas Hospital Association . The traditional reasons opponents have cited to oppose expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the federal government will reduce funding for the newly eligible population or that it would disincentive able-bodied adults from getting jobs — have all been disproven by the experience of the 39 states that have adopted the policy over the last 12 years , Medicaid experts said . “ The research is just so overwhelming and the experience of other states is so overwhelming it becomes very hard to use that argument , it becomes more just , ‘ Well , we can ’ t afford this right now . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” said Adam Searing , associate professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy ’ s Center for Children and Families . “ Those , I think , are weak arguments against it. ” The latest expansion push also comes as states continue to eye congressionally approved incentives for adopting Medicaid expansion that require the federal government to cover an extra 5 percent of costs of the entire Medicaid program — on top of covering 90 percent of costs for the newly eligible population — for states that adopt expansion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicaid expansion would save the state a net $ 32 million over the next two years . “ The experience from other states has shown that rural hospitals — which , basically all of our hospitals are rural — stand to benefit the most from this , ” Josh Hannes , vice president of the Wyoming Hospital Association told lawmakers during a committee hearing last week . “ We have hospitals with 12 days cash on hand . We ’ ve lost a nursing home this year . We have seen decreased services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few places , and we ’ ve seen over the years the decrease in mental health. ” In Wyoming , moderate Republicans — led by state Sen. Cale Case — are optimistic about their latest proposal , which passed out of a joint legislative committee on Tuesday 9-5 , with seven of the committee ’ s 12 Republicans voting for the measure . “ I ’ ve voted against this probably 10 times . I kept learning in the legislature and I have learned , and , as I look back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ” said Rep. Steve Harshman , the committee ’ s co-chair , just before the vote . “ I ’ ve learned more and I think it ’ ll be really good for our state. ” While the policy , which would expand coverage to roughly 19,000 people , faces opposition from the state Republican Party , Case told POLITICO he believes that concern among lawmakers about the state ’ s changing economy as it scales back its reliance on mining and increases its dependence on tourism — and its service-sector jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust health insurance — could persuade his colleagues to change their minds . But during a recent legislative hearing , conservative lawmakers continued to express skepticism about the program . “ Every employer I ’ ve ever worked for has had the option for insurance . I want to make sure we ’ re covering people that don ’ t have the option for insurance , ” said Sen. Tom James , who insisted during the hearing that people making $ 250,000 to $ 500,000 could qualify for Medicaid expansion , despite state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t the case . Case is warning his colleagues that it would be better to craft their own legislation than have a ballot measure , which is what happened in South Dakota and six other states . “ My colleagues are scared as heck , ” Case said . “ They may not like the Medicaid expansion proposal that comes out of an initiative . And , by golly , they ’ ve got an army of volunteers and they have money to put towards it . So , I think the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track record of seven states . Not one of them has turned it down . ” """"""",0

"The impeachment trial of Ken Paxton that ended in his acquittal on Saturday was about more than the fate of the Texas attorney general. It was also the most dramatic flashpoint in a yearslong struggle among Republican leaders in the Legislature over control of the party and the future direction of the state. The trial occurred only because a majority of Republicans in the Texas House voted in May to impeach Mr. Paxton, sending charges of bribery and abuse of office to the State Senate. Constitutionally obligated to hold a trial, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the staunchly conservative politician who sits at the head of the Senate, vowed to do so impartially. But after the voting was done on Saturday, and Republican state senators decided overwhelmingly against removing Mr. Paxton from office, the lieutenant governor lashed out at the Texas House, whose Republican members are more moderate. He accused them of wasting “millions of dollars” and called for a “full audit"" of public spending on the case since March, when the House investigation began, as well as stricter impeachment rules in the Texas Constitution.",0

""""""" Oregon 's LGBTQ community worries that a new law will keep them from obtaining guns Some of Oregon 's trans and queer gun supporters are worried that a new state law will prevent them from buying firearms . The law , Measure 114 , grants county sheriffs and police chiefs discretion to determine who qualifies to purchase a firearm under a new permit-to-purchase program . But Measure 114 lacks criteria clearly defining what disqualifies applicants , details on what makes someone a threat and what data can be used by law enforcement in making that decision . That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement , particularly in the racial justice protests that took place over the past two years . `` I just feel like if I was to go online and say like the police are terrorists or something ...

'' Rose focuses her efforts on sales and training for LGBTQ+ and black , Indigenous and people of color ( BIPOC ) .

Recent shootings like those in the LGBTQ Club Q last month in Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead or at a school in Uvalde , Texas , in May that killed 19 students and 2 teachers have solidified their desire for armed community defense – they feel police are not there to protect them , or even willing to protect them . `` Around 2016 ... there was an increase in white supremacist violence on places of worship , like mosques or like gay bars , '' says Rose . `` And then every time there 's a shooting , more and more people , especially in the queer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like , OK , let 's start to do things . '' Activist Ross Eliot shares the desire for community defense and opposition to Measure 114 . Rose and Eliot worry the law will disproportionately inhibit outspoken marginalized groups from purchasing guns , while doing little to prevent domestic terrorism .

'' Proponents of the law say it came as a response to mass shootings and hate crimes . Liz McKanna , chairwoman of Lift Every Voice Oregon , the group that wrote Measure 114 , highlights that states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown decreases in gun deaths and injuries . `` The state police , I believe , will be drafting regulations that might clarify that law , '' she said . `` But they 're intended to be objective , and that 's something that 's left to the whim of law enforcement .

'' McKanna points toward the requirement outlined by the new state law that there is to be an annual publication by police of the number of permit applications made , approved , and denied , as well as the reason for denial .

""""""" President Biden held talks Friday with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador as a looming deadline to lift COVID-related restrictions at the U.S. southern border magnified concerns over the administration 's immigration policies and an increase in illegal border crossings . The conversation — which lasted 52 minutes and touched on cooperation over migration , energy , security and economic growth — comes at the end of a tough week for the White House . The administration faces mounting criticism over its plans to end so-called Title 42 authority , a public health order that allows border agents to expel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enacted during the Trump administration to curb the spread of COVID-19 .

After calls from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace Title 42 , the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday released a 20-page memo laying out a six-point strategy that includes sending more personnel to the border , fast-tracking procedures for those who do n't qualify for asylum and expanding temporary detention facilities along the border . Encouraging Mexico to cooperate in handling an increase in border crossings once Title 42 is lifted was to be a top agenda item in the president 's call with López Obrador , according to a senior Biden administration official . `` We really will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever to have a coordinated response , to surge additional staff and resources on both sides of our border to make sure that we have an orderly and humane response , '' said the official , speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity in advance of Biden 's conversation .

"It would be fair to ask why SNAP and agricultural subsidies are funded by a single bill. Writing for the American Prospect, Luke Goldstein argues that the winners in this arrangement aren’t farmers or SNAP recipients but the huge companies that control the American food system. “The real function of the modern farm bill is to deliver windfalls to industry by subsidizing cheap commodity grains…that sell below the cost of production to agribusiness, fast-food chains, and global exports,” Goldstein writes. The farmers who grow the commodity crops are subsidized just enough to continue producing, but most of their product doesn’t go to feeding people directly. Instead, it goes to companies that use cheap crops to make major profits. Some of it feeds animals, mostly at CAFOs—concentrated animal feeding operations—which are owned by a small number of extremely powerful companies. Some goes to oil companies, which use it in the production of corn ethanol. Much of it ends up in inexpensive, unhealthy food produced by dominant food companies and fast-food restaurants. Commodity farming is further incentivized because only commodity farmers, rather than vegetable or fruit farmers, have access to the subsidies. Goldstein concludes, “This economic arrangement, which many of today’s farmers call a new form of serfdom, not only devastates farmers but incentivizes a food system that is causing rising obesity rates, limited access to fresh foods in inner-city areas, and nearly one-third of greenhouse gas emissions globally.” When crop subsidies began in the New Deal era, large agricultural companies were opposed to the payments, which stabilized the fortunes of small-scale farmers and reduced their demand for fertilizer. But the reauthorization of the Farm Bill every five years was an opportunity for agribusiness to monopolize the industry. Beginning in the 1970s, just as antitrust laws were being reinterpreted in favor of lower prices for consumers, lawmakers began to prioritize large, single-crop farms over small, diversified family farms as the way to structure the food system. Richard Nixon’s secretary of agriculture Earl Butz insisted that farmers would have to “go big or get out.” And get out they did: over 2 million farmers left the industry between 1950 and 1990. Food aid was added to the Farm Bill in 1964, when the representatives of Southern cotton farmers needed broader support to pass a bill favorable to them but disliked by others. Food aid—what we now know as SNAP—has been a vital part of helping the Farm Bill pass ever since. Support for SNAP has helped sneak destructive policies into the bill that have facilitated the transfer of wealth and land from farmers to corporations in the agricultural, food, oil, and chemical industries.",0

""""""" A transgender inmate who sued Idaho after being denied gender confirmation surgery will reportedly be awarded $ 2.5 million in legal fees . Adree Edmo began a lawsuit against Idaho and the state department of correction ’ s health care provider in 2017 , according to the Associated Press . Edmo was imprisoned at the time at a men ’ s facility , serving a 10-year sentence for sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy . “ In the suit , Edmo had sought access to a legal name change , “ gender appropriate ” clothing , and “ gender affirming ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a male prison at the time , also demanded a transfer to a women ’ s facility , ” Reduxx noted . “ Edmo claimed in her lawsuit that her Eighth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment were violated when her surgery was denied , ” Idaho News stated .

The state appealed , with one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edmo agreed that he did not qualify for the surgery due to his “ uncontrolled mental health issues. ” The state ’ s lawyer also said that Edmo had refused to participate in therapy to help prepare for the procedure . The appeal was unsuccessful , and Edmo received his surgery and was subsequently transferred to women ’ s prison in 2020 to serve the remainder of his sentence . He was released in 2021 . According to the Associated Press , a federal judge recently ordered Idaho and its prison medical care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.5 million in legal fees ” to Edmo . The difference between the requested and awarded amounts is reportedly due to the judge agreeing with the defendants that some of the legal fees were too high .

During the case proceedings , Edmo claimed he had been living as a woman prior to his incarceration , and that his gender dysphoria was severe . But in 2018 , one of his past victims spoke to media and contested his narrative . Brady Summers , who dated Edmo for two years , said that Edmo had not been living as a woman before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a masculine gay man . “ Never once indicated anything of gender dysphoria , ” Summers said , recounting his experience with Edmo , “ He was a predator .

I had to keep my head low . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful what I did . And the final straw of me escaping was him beating me with a frying pan. ” Edmo did a stint in jail for the abuse , but attempted to reconcile with Summers once he was released .

""""""" CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla. ( AP ) — NASA is replacing leaky seals in its moon rocket at the pad in hopes of launching it on its first test flight by the end of this month . Managers said Thursday they will conduct another test after the repairs to ensure all hydrogen fuel leaks are plugged .

READ MORE : How NASA ’ s Artemis 1 launch will mark a new era in space exploration A series of hydrogen fuel leaks and other problems halted back-to-back launch attempts last week . The Space Launch System rocket — the most powerful ever built by NASA — holds a crew capsule with three test dummies . The space agency wants to send the capsule into lunar orbit on a trial run , before putting astronauts on the next flight , in 2024 . That around-the-moon mission would pave the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 years , currently scheduled for 2025 . “ We need to get the tanking test done and then we ’ ll have to look at what is the realism and schedule ” to make a launch attempt as early as Sept. 23 , said Jim Free , who ’ s in charge of NASA ’ s exploration systems development . To launch in late September , NASA needs the OK from the Space Force in Cape Canaveral , which oversees the rocket ’ s self-destruct system . Batteries are needed to activate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course toward populated areas . These batteries must be retested periodically , and that can only be done in the hangar . The military would have to extend the certification of those batteries by an extra two weeks or more to avoid moving the rocket back to the hangar . But every time the rocket moves between the hangar and launch pad adds “ routine wear and tear , and I don ’ t want to do that ” unless necessary , said chief engineer John Blevins . There already have been three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice countdowns and , most recently , the thwarted launch attempts of Aug. 29 and Saturday . Engineers are hopeful that replacing a pair of seals in the hydrogen fuel lines at the bottom of the rocket will take care of any lingering leaks .

"We can save the rights we have inherited from our fathers only by winning new ones to bequeath our children. – Henry Demarest Lloyd After nearly 50 years of corporate, conservative, and neoliberal assaults on the progressive achievements of the long “Age of Roosevelt” from the 1930s to the early 1970s—assaults that have stripped workers, women, and people of color of their hard-won rights, engendered unprecedented concentrations of wealth and power, and devastated the lives of millions—the American political system, indeed, American democratic life is in jeopardy. The time has come to do what our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents did. The time has come to make America progressive, indeed, radical again. The time has come to renew the fight for an Economic Bill of Rights for All Americans. Public faith in government “to do the right thing” cratered over a decade ago and has remained low. Most feel that money perverts our elections, resulting in policies that favor the rich over the average person. (They are right on both counts.) Scandals and innuendo receive more coverage than legislation and policy. Partisan squabbling dominates the national dialogue. Blocking the opposition takes precedence over pursuing a positive program. And to top it all off, the Republican Party is poised to re-nominate Donald Trump for President, even though mountains of evidence show that he broke his oath to uphold the Constitution in attempting to reverse the result of the 2020 presidential election. Moreover, he has good chance of winning in 2024—which would be not just terribly tragic, but also perversely ironic in light of the fact that the American people support democracy overwhelmingly and avidly.",0

This article reviews the Tuskegee Syphilis Study in Macon County , Alabama that began in 1932 as well as other US government experiments that infected sick and vulnerable people with syphilis and other deadly diseases applied in Guatemala between 1946 and 1948 . In Macon County , Alabama , the U.S. government monitored more than 600 black sharecroppers including 399 who were already infected with syphilis while the remaining 201 who were not . Many people of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical establishment because of this troubling history of human experimentations . According to CNN who was there to witness the historical moment of the first Covid-19 vaccine given to a black woman but in reality , it was propaganda for Big Pharma “ A critical care nurse was the first person in New York and among the first people in the United States to get a shot of the coronavirus vaccine authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration. ” The US Government ’ s Human Experiments in Guatemala Image below : Female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. government under President Harry S. Truman , a Democrat from Missouri partnered with one of the poorest countries in Latin America , Guatemala , a U.S. puppet state with its President and lap dog , Juan José Arévalo and the rest of his criminal cohorts or shall we say his “ health care officials ” began experimenting directly with approximately 1,300 test subjects out of the 5,500 Guatemalans who were infected purposely without their informed consent . They were infected with syphilis , gonorrhea and a bacterial sexual infection called chancroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitutes and patients who had mental issues . The experiments began in 1946 and ended around 1948 . In a report by the Boston Globe , Susan M. Reverby , a medical historian and professor at Wellesley College in Wellesley , Massachusetts discovered that “ US government scientists in the 1940s deliberately infected hundreds of Guatemalans with syphilis and gonorrhea in experiments conducted without the subjects ’ permission. ” Reverby discovered the documents about “ four or five years ago while researching the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study ” and discussed her findings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that “ The US scientists — who had received the blessings of Guatemalan health authorities — were among the leading lights in the field of sexually transmitted disease research. ” However , here is where the insanity was exposed : The discovery happened while Reverby , who was at the University of Pittsburgh some years before conducting research for her book ‘ Examining Tuskegee ’ which she focused on Dr. Thomas Parran Jr ’ s archives . Dr. Parran was a US surgeon general who was involved in studying methods in controlling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archives from another researcher who is deceased by the name of John C. Cutler who was a U.S. health service physician during the later years of Tuskegee syphilis study that began in 1932 . Cutler studied the effects and other different aspects such as the prevention and treatment of antibiotics called penicillin on individuals who were infected . In a BBC article from 2011 , ‘ US scientists ‘ knew Guatemala syphilis tests unethical ’ said that “ according to documents the commission had studied , at least 83 of the 5,500 subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” The article mentioned Dr Amy Gutmann , who was head of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues at the time and stated that the research was a “ shameful piece of medical history ” and that “ It is important that we accurately document this clearly unethical historical injustice .

The report exposed the event as a shameful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment . The report ‘ Black men untreated in Tuskegee Syphilis Study ’ said that “ during a 40-year federal experiment , a group of syphilis victims was denied proper medical treatment for their disease ” , several participants had already died from the experiment .

Bernard who is the head of a Brooklyn mega church called the Christian Cultural Center was asked by a major healthcare organization to sit on a committee to propagandize the black and brown communities to accept Covid-19 vaccines as safe and effective . Bernard said that “ he turned down the offer because he worried some members of his congregation could view his participation as “ joining forces with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ as guinea pigs ” for vaccines that have been developed in record time. ” That was a powerful statement since his concerns rightfully goes back to the history of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study in Macon County , Alabama : It ’ s was not just in Guatemala and Alabama , USA that people were used as experimental guinea pigs .

""""""" One rule you can take to the bank is whatever Congress names a new Law/Bill/Act , you can assume the TRUTH about it is the exact opposite . The Affordable Care Act a/k/a “ Obamacare ” — it nearly destroyed our healthcare system and suddenly made basic healthcare unaffordable for many people . The Patriot Act — one of the least patriotic things ever to come out of Congress . Employee Free Choice Act — actually takes away choice from workers . I think you get the idea… There are dozens of them ! And today we add a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Respect For Marriage Act ” . This has nothing to do with respecting a Biblical definition of Marriage , in fact it makes a mockery of “ one man + one woman ” . But that ’ s not my biggest beef with it . My biggest beef is the hidden danger it poses . Ask yourself this : why did we even need this ? Anyone else remember that ? It has been 100 % protected and recognized at the Federal level for decades now ! So…why do we suddenly need this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with protecting marriage or even gay marriage…that was already accomplished a long time ago . What this adds is a MASSIVE penalty to any church that chooses to not support gay marriage . Refuse to preach “ gay is ok ” from the pulpit ? Under this new Act , you ’ ll face losing your 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) protection . In other words , bankruptcy city here you come ! It ’ s a hidden and devious way to either change the preaching in thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their doors . And I ’ m sure Democrats are happy with either outcome ! Here they are celebrating the “ big win ” today : This is how they “ sell ” it , but it ’ s not the truth of what ’ s really happening : What a scam artist this guy is : But the strange part is why we needed to protect gay sex when it was already protected a LONG time ago ! The Senate on Tuesday night approved historic legislation that provides federal protections for same-sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Biden ’ s desk for his signature in the final weeks of the Democratic-controlled Congress . The bill , called the Respect for Marriage Act , passed the evenly divided upper chamber 61 to 36 , with 12 Republicans joining their Democratic colleagues in support of the proposal . It needed 60 votes to pass . The legislation garnered support from a wider margin of GOP senators after it was amended to include provisions protecting religious liberty . The bill also protects interracial marriage . “ What a great day , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate floor after the bill ’ s passage . “ What a great day. ” Before proceeding to final passage of the marriage equality bill , senators rejected three amendments proposed by Republican Sens . Mike Lee of Utah , James Lankford of Oklahoma and Marco Rubio of Florida . With the approval by the upper chamber , the marriage equality plan returns to the House for a vote and , if cleared by the Democratic-led chamber as expected , will head to Mr. Biden to be signed into law . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act and has encouraged its passage by Congress . Forty-seven Republicans joined Democrats this summer to pass an earlier version of the legislation . The Respect for Marriage Act was introduced after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June , unraveling the constitutional right to an abortion . Concerned that other Supreme Court decisions , including those that protected the right to same-sex marriage , could be in jeopardy , Democrats moved to enshrine the right to marriage equality into federal law . The bill repeals the Clinton-era Defense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring that valid marriages are recognized regardless of “ sex , race , ethnicity or national origin. ” While the proposal garnered broad bipartisan support when it cleared the House in July , Senate Republicans raised concerns it would endanger religious freedom , prompting Schumer to postpone a vote to after the midterm elections . A bipartisan group of five senators then reached a deal on changes to the bill that would assuage Republicans ’ objections . I warned you this was coming a few weeks ago… Here ’ s what I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth Behind The New Same-Sex Marriage Bill Have you heard about the new Same-Sex Marriage Bill ? It ’ s named the “ Respect for Marriage Act , ” and if you ’ ve learned anything over the past 7 years from reading WeLoveTrump , you know that the truth about something is always 180 degrees from the name they give it . In other words : The Disdain For Biblical Marriage Act . But that ’ s not really what I want to talk about here… I want to talk about something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but credit to Kambree who did : Isn ’ t Gay Marriage already “ legal ” ? The answer , of course , is yes . For quite a while . So why do we need this new Bill ? Simple : because it gives the IRS power to revoke the tax-exempt status of churches that believe in what the Bible teaches : There you have it folks . A sneaky back door through the 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) to get churches to start preaching heresy right from the pulpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It will work in most cases . EPPC provided this warning about the new bill : The bill doesn ’ t actually provide anything new , other than opening up religious institutions to possible lawsuits just for holding a differing opinion on marriage . But religious liberty proponents say the amendment does nothing to shield Americans who have a traditional view of marriage from being targeted under the law . Heritage Action for America Executive Director Jessica Anderson released a statement saying RFMA is an “ unnecessary piece of legislation that provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different view on marriage. ” She continued : It seeks to put the federal government in charge of marriage , wipes out the rights of individuals to act in accordance with their personal beliefs , and discriminates against religious people treating them as bigots under the law . To make matters worse , the Senate is only now considering the bill in a lame-duck period after the American people voted . Supporters of the legislation have said the expected consideration of a Tillis-Collins-Baldwin amendment would address the religious liberty problems in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a messaging exercise that has no teeth , and religious Americans would still be subject to discrimination and targeting under the bill . Any senator who ’ s serious about religious liberty would be insisting on the inclusion of the Senator Mike Lee ’ s amendment based on the First Amendment Defense Act , which would actually protect religious liberty . Rather than respecting individuals , this legislation would open them up to persecution , fines , and punishment . The Heritage Foundation ’ s Roger Severino wrote that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing that is not already guaranteed. ” He wrote : NATIONAL POLL : Do You Still Support President Trump ? And it doesn ’ t cover areas where forced participation in same-sex celebrations still occur , such as with private bakers , florists , photographers , and other wedding vendors . …The drafters of these amendments are conjuring the illusion of religious freedom while undercutting it at every turn .

"A California Republican showdown featuring Donald Trump was playing out Friday – two days after the former president skipped his party’s second 2024 primary debate in Simi Valley. Trump was among several Republican presidential contenders who traveled to Anaheim to address the California GOP’s fall convention. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott were set to speak to the party faithful later Friday, with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy scheduled to follow them Saturday. Trump told the supportive Republican crowd Friday that he would win California – a state he lost by more than 5 million votes in 2020 – were it not for a “rigged election system.”",0

Underly delivered her third state of education address at the state capitol and criticized the GOP’s efforts to limit the teaching of racism’s history and impacts in schools. She also called out the emphasis on test scores as markers of student success. “They want their schools to be places where they can study complicated histories, have meaningful discussions, and learn how to be involved citizens in a world that grows more diverse by the day,” said Dr. Jill Underly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction.",0

"Spain’s elections on July 23 yielded a surprise result that’s left the country without a government for more than 10 weeks now. While the conservative Partido Popular (PP) won the most votes, no clear majority was established. The far-right party Vox also made significant gains, and has established ruling coalitions with PP at the local level. Yet nationally, left and center-left forces have managed to impede a conservative-led government from forming. Now, Pedro Sánchez of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party has been tapped by Spain’s king to lead a new effort to form a coalition government. The left might just snatch a victory from the jaws of defeat—but it depends on whether they can rally nationalist Catalan and Basque parties to their side. Professor Bécquer Seguin of John Hopkins University and Professor Sebastiaan Faber of Oberlin College join The Marc Steiner Show to follow up on an explainer they wrote for The Nation about just what on earth is going on in Spain, and what it portends for European politics at large.

"On Labour’s Last Stand The surge, the surge. It was within the margin of error in one poll, and the increase in Labour support in the other poll still wouldn’t change the outcome. Yet to the relief of the mainstream media, the surge has provided a hint of drama to talk about in a campaign where the victory of the centre right bloc has been generally agreed to be a sure thing quite some time ago. Still, let's assume that there truly has been a small uptick in Labour’s fortunes on the brink of Judgement Day. Why might this be happening?

""""""" For years , TikTok has attempted to dodge the crosshairs of the increasingly tech-skeptical U.S. government . Now , the app ’ s luck may be running out as it experiences its most pronounced backlash yet . At the ground level , the megapopular short-form video platform is losing favor among the very creatives it once helped boost . Musicians and label executives are frustrated with the marketing and revenue challenges posed by the app ’ s disruptive nature ( as well as the types of music that benefit most ) , while influencers grow wary of constant outrage cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the app ’ s increasingly dark challenges and trends , and researchers increasingly uncover data-privacy issues . That last aspect has long been a talking point for politicians concerned about TikTok ’ s China-based parent company . Now , it ’ s prompted long-anticipated governmental crackdowns . As of this week , seven U.S. states—Alabama , Utah , Maryland , Nebraska , South Dakota , South Carolina , and Texas—have outlawed employees from downloading the app onto state-owned devices , in a manner similar to the military ’ s 2020 ban of TikTok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government hasn ’ t followed suit just yet , but its attorney general has filed two lawsuits against TikTok “ for deceiving users about China ’ s access to their data and for exposing children to mature content. ” And the federal government , which has struggled to figure out just how to tackle this conundrum , may be close to drastic action . Republican Sen. Marco Rubio , a flagrant “ China hawk ” and TikTok opponent , introduced legislation on Tuesday to fully expel the app from the U.S. along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly earned bipartisan buy-in . On Wednesday night , the Senate unanimously passed a resolution introduced by Republican Josh Hawley to forbid federal employees from using TikTok on any government-owned devices . It ’ s not the first time TikTok has faced an uncertain future within the U.S. , but it may be the most serious . In addition to all the state-level restrictions , the FBI ’ s director has called TikTok a national security threat , and an FCC commissioner has asked Apple and Google to remove the platform from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Representatives ’ chief administrative officer issued a “ cyber advisory ” recommending against “ the download or use of this application due to these security and privacy concerns. ” TikTok has always been on shaky ground within the U.S. ( and internationally ) . Before now , its most serious governmental threat arrived back in 2020 , when the Trump administration announced that domestic users would no longer be able to download TikTok if its parent company , Bytedance , didn ’ t sell the app to a U.S.-based firm . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Donald Trump seemed to forget about TikTok after he lost his reelection bid , perhaps because he had other schemes in mind . At any rate , President Joe Biden axed Trump ’ s order shortly after taking power , and went on to court TikTok influencers for publicity ’ s sake ( though he forbade his 2020 campaign staffers from using the app in either a professional or personal capacity ) . Yet in light of news reports concerning Chinese access to American users ’ data , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration has negotiated with TikTok to work out policy that could reduce security risks . The two parties reached a preliminary agreement in September that would require the app to store American user data on stateside servers , delegate oversight of TikTok feed algorithm to the software company Oracle , and convene a board of security experts who ’ d ensure compliance . The deal hasn ’ t gone into effect yet , likely for one big reason : TikTok hawks don ’ t think this goes far enough . They want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. company . This isn ’ t just partisan rebuttal : Anti-TikTok sentiment among some lawmakers is so strong that in 2020 , some of Trump ’ s closest allies didn ’ t even think his order went far enough . Sen.

To such dissenters , simply taking TikTok away from a Chinese company was far from sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase transparency regarding TikTok ’ s algorithm and data storage . Biden ’ s deal , which preserves ByteDance ownership with some caveats , isn ’ t going to please these guys—the app already has made internal changes in staffing and content moderation processes , and that hasn ’ t quelled the vitriol .

"Advertisement for The Texas Tribune Festival featuring Nikole Hannah-Jones and Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [Photo: Texas Tribune] On September 21, a broad assortment of reactionary figures, ranging from far-right to pseudo-left, converged on the capital city of Austin, Texas. The occasion was the annual Texas Tribune Festival, hosted by the eponymous newspaper which was founded by venture capitalist John Thorton in 2009. Speakers included election denier Ted Cruz, racialist falsifier of history Nikole Hannah-Jones, and DSA member and congressman Greg Casar, along with other anti-working-class politicians, corporate media hacks, and academics. The festival held events at three venues in downtown Austin: the Omni Hotel, St. David’s Episcopal Church, and the Paramount Theater.

"John Westmoreland charts the history of revolutionary and socialist thinking about trade-union struggles and the forms of working-class consciousness Before Marx and Engels, none of the socialist theorists or groupings argued for consistent work in the emerging trade unions. When trade unions emerged in Britain, they went beyond the trade societies that defended craft skills and petitioned their masters over pay. Trade unions ‘combined’ as workers standing together and striking together over pay. Early trade unions faced opposition from the bosses and the state. Trade unionism was criminalised in the 1799 Combinations Act. It took tremendous courage and energy to form trade unions, and they were, from the start, political. They were an important part of the Peterloo protests for democracy in 1819. So trade unionism at the root confronted the bosses and the state.",0

""""""" A legal system capable of delivering justice fairly and equally is a cornerstone of a functioning democracy . But in the United States , some racial groups are more likely to run afoul of that system than others . Approximately 1.3 million Americans are currently incarcerated , a higher per capita rate than any other country ’ s . And while one in every 17 white men in the United States will be jailed at some point in their life , one in three Black men will suffer the same fate . Black and Hispanic men are also sentenced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For these reasons , Black people comprise the majority of prisoners in the United States despite being a minority in the population at large . This racial disparity is reflected in data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ( NLSY ) , a survey following almost 9,000 young Americans throughout their lives starting in 1997 . Survey respondents are chosen so that the sample matches the demographic characteristics of the US population . Figure 1 shows NLSY respondents and their incarceration status as of the start of the year 2017 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had spent time in jail.1 Figure 1 : Respondents to the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth by Race/Ethnicity and Incarceration Status2 While racial disparities in crime and punishment are always concerning , they are especially troubling if their consequences extend beyond the legal system . Although a recent study using the NLSY showed no evidence that incarceration reduces wages , incarceration was associated with a lower likelihood of employment after release . That decreased employment in turn reduces the overall annual income of ex-convicts by $ 4,000– $ 5,000 per year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income compared to the non-incarcerated . If being imprisoned causes reduced income , then every sentence is in effect a life sentence in terms of its consequences for the convict—and any racial disparities become even more consequential . While a long-term study of prisoners before and after incarceration found no racial differences in the rate of wage growth prior to being incarcerated , wage growth after imprisonment for Black people was 21 percent slower than that of their white counterparts.3 Why does this happen ? Ex-cons do not seem to avoid the workplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Very few expect to be stigmatized , either in the form of being pushed away from their family or being turned away from a job . A study from 2010 found that “ many of the [ unemployed ] ex-inmates in our sample did not experience trouble finding work upon their return to the community…rather they were not looking for work. ” On the other hand , a different study discovered that the presence of incarceration on a résumé drastically reduces the possibility of a callback , with the reduction far worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in the chance of a callback ) than for white applicants ( a 30 percent drop ) . In fact , a white person who has been incarcerated has a similar probability of a callback to a Black person that has not been in jail . And jail time negatively impacts an inmate ’ s mental health as well : The incarcerated are 21 percent more likely in the short term and 10 percent more likely in the long term to report depression than those who were never incarcerated . These ramifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s desire and ability to get and hold a job , or to advance in their career once they have one.4 Previously incarcerated people are , on average , less prosperous than those who have never been in jail . Figure 2 compares the household income of ex-cons to those never imprisoned , using NLSY data for the year 2017 . We separated the data into two race-ethnicity groupings : non-Black non-Hispanics ( primarily whites and Asians ) are in one group , and Black , Hispanics , and mixed-race respondents are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly incarcerated respondents have a lower income than those who were never incarcerated . But among non-Black non-Hispanic respondents , the previously incarcerated have incomes 200 percentage points lower ( relative to the poverty line ) than those who have never been incarcerated . That gap is double the size of the comparable difference between income among incarcerated and non-incarcerated Black , Hispanic , and mixed-race respondents . This may be because the non-Black non-Hispanic group has a much higher typical income and thus has further to fall if they are imprisoned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average household income that is close to the average among Black , Hispanic , or mixed-race respondents who have never been incarcerated.5 The racial asymmetry of incarceration ’ s consequences is also shown in Figure 3 , which plots a respondent ’ s total months of incarceration against their household income in 2017 . Among non-Black non-Hispanic respondents , every year in prison reduces a person ’ s income by about 2.21 percentage points relative to the poverty line . But length of incarceration has little impact on poverty for the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondents . Regardless of the length of their stay in jail , the average income in this group is similar to the average of non-Black non-Hispanic respondents who have been incarcerated for six years . Any causal explanation for the effect of jail on post-release poverty must also be able to explain why minority groups experience nearly the same penalty on income regardless of the length of their sentence.7 Figure 3 : Household Income and Length of Incarceration , by Race/Ethnicity8 Our analysis is not without shortcomings . The NLSY data set contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and released ) before 2017 , a relatively small sample . The spike in incarcerations starting in the 1990s has created a large population of ex-convicts . Given the size of that population , we think that more data collection is warranted to help better understand the long-term consequences of jail time . Nor have we ruled out the possibility that reduced income in the past might encourage someone to enter a life of crime.9 Despite these reservations , it seems clear from our analysis that incarceration is an ordeal that lasts well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even a short sentence has a dramatic impact on the income of someone from a minoritized racial group , much larger than that imposed on non-Black non-Hispanics . And given that effect on income , it is unsurprising that mass incarceration has been connected to racial wealth inequality in the United States . Fortunately , there is an alternative .

In August , the U.S. Economic Development Association awarded $ 500 million in competitive workforce development grants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that promote economic activity in their regions . The funds come from the American Rescue Plan ’ s “ Good Jobs Challenge ” and only two organizations were chosen in California – one of them the Fresno County Economic Development Corporation . The EDA described the grants as “ once-in-a-generation investments ” to “ transform American communities ” in the modern economy . Eager said there has been a years-long goal to draw manufacturing and transportation jobs to the Fresno region and diversify the local economy , and the federal funds are helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic development corporation is intended to expand job training in four areas : construction , business services , manufacturing and transportation . The organization stated in its grant application that the local workforce would benefit from training to gain skills such as welding , commercial truck driving , bookkeeping , math and digital literacy .

Those funds often meet existing local and state grants aiming to improve job training at the local level . With federal investments reaching the San Joaquin Valley , the plan to transform the region into a destination for manufacturing and transportation jobs is getting a boost . On a recent Thursday , a section of a large warehouse was opened as the site of the John R. Lawson Truck Driving School in south Fresno . The location is a new setting for an existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 truck drivers since at least 2015 . With the new funding , there are hopes to double the number of students per training , Eager said . Corina Hernandez , 32 , of Fresno , is among six women taking part in the current group of 24 truck driving students at the school . She is half way into the training , but already thinks she may stick with truck driving until she retires , she told PBS NewsHour . “ I am a single mother . My son is 15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better living for us and I would hope to be able to buy us a home one day , ” Hernandez said . Trucking is a nearly $ 800 billion industry and moves about 72 percent of the nation ’ s goods , according to data from the American Trucking Associations .

And in 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly introduce more electric trucks starting in 2024 . “ When those new technologies come , we will get the trucks and we ’ ll have those switched over to those zero-emission vehicles and [ students ] will train on those , too , ” Eager said .

According to the National Skills Coalition , an organization that promotes skilled training , industries like construction and transportation were already facing constraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 pandemic . While local economies benefit from manufacturing jobs , employment in the industry has fallen in the last 40 years in the U.S. and it has struggled to recover amid recessions . As states prepare for IIJA funds , there is an even greater opportunity and need to train workers for the new infrastructure jobs that will be created , the organization states . In Fresno County , Eager said the investment in such jobs could help not just the local economy , but the nation , too . The county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be 10,000 new jobs added in the four sectors funded by the EDA grant by 2026 . “ Our goal is to ensure that these are jobs that are living wage jobs , that people can support their families and that have benefits attached to them , ” she said .

Most people simply follow the orders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned our complete trust . They haven ’ t done so . This manuscript is a step forward in terms of accountability and the free flow of information on this crucial subject . Please take the time to read it and share it widely . SARS-CoV-2 mass vaccination : Urgent questions on vaccine safety that demand answers from international health agencies , regulatory authorities , governments and vaccine developers Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak , the race for testing new platforms designed to confer immunity against SARS-CoV-2 , has been rampant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various vaccines . Despite progress on early multidrug therapy for COVID-19 patients , the current mandate is to immunize the world population as quickly as possible . The lack of thorough testing in animals prior to clinical trials , and authorization based on safety data generated during trials that lasted less than 3.5 months , raise questions regarding the safety of these vaccines . The recently identified role of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein Spike for inducing endothelial damage characteristic of COVID-19 , even in absence of infection , is extremely relevant given that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spike glycoprotein in the recipients . Given the high rate of occurrence of adverse effects , and the wide range of types of adverse effects that have been reported to date , as well as the potential for vaccine-driven disease enhancement , Th2-immunopathology , autoimmunity , and immune evasion , there is a need for a better understanding of the benefits and risks of mass vaccination , particularly in the groups that were excluded in the clinical trials . Despite calls for caution , the risks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been minimized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities . We appeal to the need for a pluralistic dialogue in the context of health policies , emphasizing critical questions that require urgent answers if we wish to avoid a global erosion of public confidence in science and public health . Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 , over 150 million cases and 3 million deaths have been reported worldwide . Despite progress on early ambulatory , multidrug-therapy for high-risk patients , resulting in 85 % reductions in COVID-19 hospitalization and death [ 1 ] , the current paradigm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize the effort involved in development , production and emergency authorization of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines , we are concerned that risks have been minimized or ignored by health organizations and government authorities , despite calls for caution [ 2-8 ] . Vaccines for other coronaviruses have never been approved for humans , and data generated in the development of coronavirus vaccines designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies show that they may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement ( ADE ) and Th2 immunopathology , regardless of the vaccine platform and delivery method [ 9-11 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is known to occur following viral challenge , and has been attributed to immune complexes and Fc-mediated viral capture by macrophages , which augment T-cell activation and inflammation [ 11-13 ] . In March 2020 , vaccine immunologists and coronavirus experts assessed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine risks based on SARS-CoV-vaccine trials in animal models . The expert group concluded that ADE and immunopathology were a real concern , but stated that their risk was insufficient to delay clinical trials , although continued monitoring would be necessary [ 14 ] . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrence of ADE and vaccine-related immunopathology in volunteers immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [ 15 ] , safety trials to date have not specifically addressed these serious adverse effects ( SAE ) . Given that the follow-up of volunteers did not exceed 2-3.5 months after the second dose [ 16-19 ] , it is unlikely such SAE would have been observed . Despite92 errors in reporting , it can not be ignored that even accounting for the number of vaccines administered , according to the US Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System ( VAERS ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine doses administered has increased more than 10-fold . We believe there is an urgent need for open scientific dialogue on vaccine safety in the context of large-scale immunization . In this paper , we describe some of the risks of mass vaccination in the context of phase 3 trial exclusion criteria and discuss the SAE reported in national and regional adverse effect registration systems . We highlight unanswered questions and draw attention to the need for a more cautious approach to mass vaccination . With few exceptions , SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible to identify the occurrence of post-vaccination eosinophilia and enhanced inflammation in elderly people . Studies of SARS-CoV vaccines showed that immunized elderly mice were at particularly high risk of life-threatening Th2 immunopathology [ 9,20 ] . Despite this evidence and the extremely limited data on safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the elderly , mass-vaccination campaigns have focused on this age group from the start . Most trials also excluded pregnant and lactating volunteers , as well as those with chronic and serious conditions such as tuberculosis , hepatitis C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immune suppression [ 16-29 ] , although these recipients are now being offered the vaccine under the premise of safety . Another criterion for exclusion from nearly all trials was prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 . This is unfortunate as it denied the opportunity of obtaining extremely relevant information concerning post-vaccination ADE in people that already have anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies . To the best of our knowledge , ADE is not being monitored systematically for any age or medical condition group currently being administered the vaccine . Moreover , despite a substantial proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] , tests to determine SARS-CoV-2-antibody status prior to administration of the vaccine are not conducted routinely . Will serious adverse effects from the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines go unnoticed ? COVID-19 encompasses a wide clinical spectrum , ranging from very mild to severe pulmonary pathology and fatal multi-organ disease with inflammatory , cardiovascular , and blood coagulation dysregulation [ 22-24 ] . In this sense , cases of vaccine-related ADE or immunopathology would be clinically-indistinguishable from severe COVID-19 [ 25 ] . Furthermore , even in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 virus , Spike glycoprotein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitro and in vivo in Syrian hamsters by down-regulating angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) and impairing mitochondrial function [ 26 ] . Although these findings need to be confirmed in humans , the implications of this finding are staggering , as all vaccines authorized for emergency use are based on the delivery or induction of Spike glycoprotein synthesis . In the case of mRNA vaccines and adenovirus-vectorized vaccines , not a single study has examined the duration of Spike production in humans following vaccination . Under the cautionary principle , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause clinical signs of severe COVID-19 , and erroneously be counted as new cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections . If so , the true adverse effects of the current global vaccination strategy may never be recognized unless studies specifically examine this question . There is already non-causal evidence of temporary or sustained increases138 in COVID-19 deaths following vaccination in some countries ( Fig . 1 ) and in light of Spike ’ s pathogenicity , these deaths must be studied in depth to determine whether they are related to vaccination . Another critical issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is autoimmunity . SARS-CoV-2 has numerous immunogenic proteins , and all but one of its immunogenic epitopes have similarities to human proteins [ 27 ] . These may act as a source of antigens , leading to autoimmunity [ 28 ] . While it is true that the same effects could be observed during natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 , vaccination is intended for most of the world population , while it is estimated that only 10 % of the world population has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 , according to Dr. Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Health Organization . We have been unable to find evidence that any of the currently authorized vaccines screened and excluded homologous immunogenic epitopes to avoid potential autoimmunity due to pathogenic priming . Some adverse reactions , including blood-clotting disorders , have already been reported in healthy and young vaccinated people . These cases led to the suspension or cancellation of the use of adenoviral vectorized ChAdOx1-nCov-19 and Janssen vaccinesin some countries . It has now been proposed that vaccination with ChAdOx1-nCov-19 can result in immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia ( VITT ) mediated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinically mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [ 29 ] . Unfortunately , the risk was overlooked when authorizing these vaccines , although adenovirus-induced thrombocytopenia has been known for more than a decade , and has been a consistent event with adenoviral vectors [ 30 ] . The risk of VITT would presumably be higher in those already at risk of blood clots , including women who use oral contraceptives [ 31 ] , making it imperative for clinicians to advise their patients accordingly . At the population level , there could also be vaccine-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus that has so far produced more than 40,000 variants [ 32,33 ] some of which affect the antigenic domain of Spike glycoprotein [ 34,35 ] . Given the high mutation rates , vaccine-induced synthesis of high levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike antibodies could theoretically lead to suboptimal responses against subsequent infections by other variants in vaccinated individuals [ 36 ] , a phenomenon known as “ original antigenic sin ” [ 37 ] or antigenic priming [ 38 ] . It is unknown to what extent mutations that affect SARS-CoV-2 antigenicity will become fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but vaccines could plausibly act as selective forces driving variants with higher infectivity or transmissibility . Considering the high similarity between known SARS-CoV-2 variants , this scenario is unlikely [ 32,34 ] but if future variants were to differ more in key epitopes , the global vaccination strategy might have helped shape an even more dangerous virus . This risk has recently been brought to the attention of the WHO as an open letter [ 40 ] . The risks outlined here are a major obstacle to continuing global SARS-CoV-2 vaccination . Evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed before exposing more people to the184 risk of these experiments , since releasing a candidate vaccine without time to fully understand the resulting impact on health could lead to an exacerbation of the current global crisis [ 41 ] . Risk-stratification of vaccine recipients is essential . According to the UK government , people below 60 years of age have an extremely low risk of dying from COVID-191 187 . However , according to Eudravigillance , most of the serious adverse effects following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination occur in people aged 18-64 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule for children aged 6 years and older in the United States and the UK . Dr. Anthony Fauci recently anticipated that teenagers across the country will be vaccinated in the autumn and younger children in early 2022 , and the UK is awaiting trial results to commence vaccination of 11 million children under 18 . There is a lack of scientific justification for subjecting healthy children to experimental vaccines , given that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that they have a 99.997 % survival rate if infected with SARS-CoV-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat to this age group , but there is no reliable evidence to support vaccine efficacy or effectiveness in this population or to rule out harmful side effects of these experimental vaccines . In this sense , when physicians advise patients on the elective administration of COVID-19 vaccination , there is a great need to better understand the benefits and risk of administration , particularly in understudied groups . In conclusion , in the context of the rushed emergency-use-authorization of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines , and the current gaps in our understanding of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised : • Is it known whether cross-reactive antibodies from previous coronavirus infections or vaccine206 induced antibodies may influence the risk of unintended pathogenesis following vaccination with COVID-19 ? • Has the specific risk of ADE , immunopathology , autoimmunity , and serious adverse reactions been clearly disclosed to vaccine recipients to meet the medical ethics standard of patient understanding for informed consent ? If not , what are the reasons , and how could it be implemented ? • What is the rationale for administering the vaccine to every individual when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal across age groups and clinical conditions and when the phase 3 trials excluded the elderly , children and frequent specific conditions ? • What are the legal rights of patients if they are harmed by a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ? Who will cover the costs of medical treatment ? If claims were to be settled with public money , has the public been made aware that the vaccine manufacturers have been granted immunity , and their responsibility to compensate those harmed by the vaccine has been transferred to the tax-payers ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halting mass-vaccination and opening an urgent pluralistic , critical , and scientifically-based dialogue on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among scientists , medical doctors , international health agencies , regulatory authorities , governments , and vaccine developers .

""""""" Can you think of any Western politician who can entertain questions even from virulent opponents for four hours ? Has any Western leader been able to do that in recent memory ? How about George W. Bush ? Obama ? Perhaps Angela Merkel ? Well , Vladimir Putin has been able to do just that . In fact , he did exactly that at the end of last month . Throughout his speech and discussion , Putin again brought the moral issue back on the political table , which inexorably is at the root of nearly all the current political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Putin certainly did not fail to deliver : “ Many Western states have taken the way where they deny or reject their own roots , including their Christian roots which form the basis of Western civilization . In these countries , the moral basis and any traditional identity are being denied – national , religious , cultural and even gender identities are being denied or relativized. ” [ 1 ] The fact that he raised the gender identity issues , which he said “ are being denied or relativized , ” is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically articulates the promiscuous idea that morality should not play any role in identifying gender and that pedophilia is simply a relic of the past . This is also a pointed rebuke to leading Satanists like Sigmund Freud and Wilhelm Reich , who postulated that sexual liberation should be pursued at any cost . Reich meant it when he postulated in his Sexual Revolution : “ The first precondition for the improvement of human and sexual relationships is the absolute break with those moral views which base their commandments either on allegedly supernatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition . The laws of morality should also be founded on the insights gained by progressive science. ” [ 2 ] Like the French encyclopedists , Reich deliberately fell into the trap that true science can really contradict morality , when in fact morality is essentially the cornerstone or the pillar upon which true scientific enterprise is based . He was not the only one to have deliberately fallen into that trap . Charles Darwin actually beat him to the punch . Darwin excluded morality from his intellectual project , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blatant contradiction . “ Everything in nature , ” says Darwin , “ is the results of fixed laws. ” [ 3 ] Darwin came to this conclusion because he began to embrace what biographers Adrian Desmond and James Moore call “ a terrifying materialism , ” according to which “ the human mind , morality , and even belief in God were artifacts of the brain… ” [ 4 ] In that sense , Darwin believed that morality was created , not discovered , by evolution . [ 5 ] According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin “ was trying to turn morality into a branch of biology through the proposal that our instinctive behavior can only be understood as a product of natural processes that have adapted us to a particular way of life based on the family unit as a means of raising children. ” [ 6 ] If everything , including morality , is the artifact of the brain , if our behavior is “ instinctive , programmed by evolution into the very structure of our brains , ” and if “ morality is merely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 7 ] then there is no moral responsibility . We simply can not condemn immoral acts and immoral people like Benjamin Netanyahu and oligarchic empires like Goldman Sachs . There is more , Darwin believed that “ man ’ s mind had emerged from the worm ’ s in the first place . This was the crux. ” [ 8 ] If morality is out of the equation , then what is left is basically strife , force , and might . In short , survival of the fittest . Darwin meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands , who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox . Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind . No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man . “ It is surprising how soon a want of care , or care wrongly directed , leads to the degeneration of a domestic race ; but excepting in the case of man himself , hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow his worst animals to breed. ” [ 9 ] It is no accident that Darwinism and Capitalism have a kindred spirit . [ 10 ] As historian of biology Peter J. Bowler points out , Darwin “ projected the competitive ethos of capitalism onto nature and then bent all his observations to fit into the pattern imposed by his own mind . Darwin did not discover natural selection : he invented it and then sold it to a world that was only too willing to see its own values provided with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists ’ efforts to portray Darwin as a purely objective researcher are merely a device used to conceal the ideological foundations of science itself. ” [ 11 ] Darwin complicated things when he declared that he “ would rather be descended from a heroic little monkey that sacrificed her life than from a savage ‘ who delights to torture his enemies , offers up bloody sacrifices , practices infanticide without remorse , treats his wives like slaves , knows no decency , and his haunted by the grossest superstitions. ’ ” [ 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin ? Philosophically and ideologically , Darwin wants to be cruel to the “ imbeciles. ” In fact , he said quite explicitly that the “ imbeciles ” ought to be eliminated . Yet practically the same Darwin was complaining that the “ savages ” shouldn ’ t delight in torturing each other . Darwin did not even accept the idea that morality could be “ objective and universal ” ! [ 13 ] In fact , he believed that “ The natural world has no moral validity or purpose. ” [ 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s intellectual children like Bradley A. Thayer still haven ’ t solved the internal contradiction that exists in their own weltanschauung which they desperately want to be true . When all is said and done , Darwin preferred to live in contradiction rather than allowing moral duty to guide his thinking . He posited the claim that the “ imbeciles ” do not deserve to live , but he repudiated people who put that idea to practice . Objective morality does not exist and even infanticide has a Darwinian mechanism , [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savages to commit infanticide and to practice human sacrifices . What ’ s more interesting is that Darwin thought that it was wise to impose that “ objective ” law upon the savages ! Darwin was basically peddling falsehoods and then shouting “ science ! ” to advance a metaphysically incoherent and worthless system . He was advocating genocide and then turning around condemning those who practiced genocide . His intellectual children still use the “ science ! ” mantra even to this very day to silence thinkers and skeptics . [ 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Ruse as recently argued , Darwinism is now a full-fledged religion , with its own priests and doctrine . [ 17 ] Other philosophers such as James Rachels have argued that Darwin ’ s followers are sometimes reluctant to follow the moral implications of his system to their logical conclusions because they are existentially unlivable or “ morally pernicious. ” [ 18 ] Darwin ’ s intellectual children still overlook his rejection of objective morality but see with amazing clarity that objective morality needs to be upheld when confronting Zionism and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have blown those people ’ s head off and asked them to start thinking straight . As he put it : “ In his book on politics [ the modern revolutionist ] attacks men for trampling on morality ; in his book on ethics he attacks morality for trampling on men . Therefore the modern man in revolt has become practically useless for all purposes of revolt. ” [ 19 ] In other words , Darwin is practically useless when it comes to thinking about morality and answering metaphysical questions in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or not , Darwin was essentially articulating the views of the rich and powerful in books such as The Descent of Man . Whether he liked it or not , Darwin was essentially legitimizing Zionism , which came on the political scene when Social Darwinism began to flourish both in Europe and America at the dawn of the twentieth century . In that sense , Darwinists who criticize Zionism do so not on the basis of Darwinism but on the basis of morality , which Darwin himself rejected . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is metaphysically incoherent and therefore practically worthless . Putin is obviously smart enough to realize that if the West is to survive , politicians and thinkers need to bring back morality on the table and act on that basis . There is no other way to make sense . This is again an indirect attack on people like Wilhelm Reich . Reich understood that in order for his sexual revolution to take place , morality has to be dismissed . He put it quite bluntly that “ We do not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ‘ sin , ’ ‘ sensuality ’ fought as something low and beastly , and the ‘ conquering of the flesh ’ made the guiding principle of morality ! ” [ 20 ] What Reich meant by “ natural sexual attraction ” is that if a fifty-year-old man wants to sleep with a 10-year-old child , then this “ natural sexual attraction ” ought not to be forbidden . In other words , Reich was advocating pedophilia and other sexual deviancies . “ Sexual inhibition , ” says Reich , “ prevents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rational way. ” He moved on to say that “ If one succeeds in getting rid of the childhood fear of masturbation and as a result thereof genitality demands gratification , then intellectual insight and sexual gratification are wont and prevail. ” [ 21 ] Reich was obviously dumb on purpose . Since he was following an essentially Talmudic ideology , he had to postulate that corrupting children through sexual perversion would lead to “ intellectual insight. ” But then he also had to couch his perversion in the language of “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote in his Sexual Revolution , “ morality serves , under given circumstances and according to our best insights , the development of the individual personality , the guidance of all people toward higher and more perfect forms of living. ” [ 22 ] Sure , morality should be “ the guidance of all people toward higher and more perfect forms of living , ” but how does that line up with Reich ’ s own idea that corrupting children with sexual perversion will again lead to “ intellectual insight ” ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle would lead to a “ higher and more perfect forms of living ” ? Haven ’ t we seen the result of this nonsense for the past sixty years or so ? [ 23 ] Well , Reich was not really that stupid . Again , he was just dumb on purpose . He wrote : “ Sexual intercourse itself is neither moral nor immoral . Born from a strong , natural drive , it becomes one or the other only through opinions and accompanying circumstances. ” [ 24 ] We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If “ sexual intercourse is neither more nor immoral , ” then the women who have accused Bill Cosby of committing lewd sexual acts have made a grave mistake . If Reich is right , then there is no such thing as rape , and if rape is just an amoral activity , then Hollywood actors and actresses can ’ t complain about being raped , either . Here again we find that Darwinism and the Jewish revolutionary spirit are concentric circles because Darwinism tell us that rape has a biological basis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously removes the moral dimension . The interesting thing is that the deracinated culture has never come out and condemned Reich for his perversion ! And Darwin is still revered in academic circles around the world . Reich , who was projecting his own sexual liberation onto the world , [ 26 ] attempted to ground his perversion in biology . But as James E. Strick himself has recently pointed out , “ there is no point in looking more closely at Reich ’ s science because there was no legitimate science from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a therapist and political or social analyst. ” [ 27 ] What ’ s interesting about Putin is that he has indirectly attacked Satanists like Reich . He has articulated the view that “ the moral basis and any traditional identity are being denied ” in the West . “ There , ” he continued , “ politics treats a family with many children as equal to a homosexual partnership ( juridically ) . ” Then Putin dropped the political bomb , which obviously makes him a villain in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excesses and exaggerations of political correctness in these countries indeed leads to serious consideration for the legitimization of parties that promote the propaganda of pedophilia . The people in many European states are actually ashamed of their religious affiliations and are indeed frightened to speak about them. ” Putin again said that if there is no morality , then “ the degradation and primitivization of culture ” is a logical step . [ 28 ] “ What can be better evidence for the moral crisis of human society in the West than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today nearly all ‘ developed ’ Western countries can not survive reproductively , not even with the help of migrants… without rules and moral values which have formed , and been developed , over millennia , people will inevitably lose their human dignity and become brutes. ” Putin continued to deconstruct the New World Order ideology this way : “ One has to respect the right of every minority to self-determination , but at the same time there can not and must not be any doubt about the rights of the majority. ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is against democracy and that he was seeking to persecute minority groups in Russia . Putin obviously knows that minority groups have to be protected , but at the same time they can not impose their ideology upon the majority . Moreover , they can not seek to subvert the moral order . Plain and simple . Obviously pedophiles , Neocons , and other New World Order agents will never forgive Putin because he is making those people look really bad . If those people are pursuing a satanic ideology , says Putin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path to degradation. ” [ 29 ] We agree . What ’ s the solution ? These people need to turn around and make practical reason or Logos their daily meal . As C. S. Lewis put it , “ If you ’ re on the wrong road , progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road ; and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man. ” This article was first published in 2017 . • [ 2 ] Wilhelm Reich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Character Structure ( New York : Farrar , Straus and Giroux , 1945 and 1974 ) , 54 . • [ 3 ] Charles Darwin , The Autobiography of Charles Darwin : 1809-1882 ( New York : W.

""""""" Politico on Monday night published what certainly appears to be a genuine draft decision by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito that would overturn the Court 's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade . Alito 's draft ruling would decide the pending case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women 's Health Organization , which concerns the constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi law that bans abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy except in the case of medical emergency or severe fetal abnormalities . Given existing Supreme Court precedent that abortion can only be restricted after fetal viability , Mississippi 's ban on abortions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point when the fetus is not yet deemed viable — is constitutionally dubious . To uphold Mississippi 's law — as six of the nine Justices reportedly wish to do — the Court must either find that the law is consistent with existing abortion precedent , or acknowledge that it conflicts with existing precedent and then overrule that precedent on the ground that it was wrongly decided . Alito 's draft is written as a majority opinion , suggesting that at least five of the Court 's justices — a majority — voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roe on the ground that it was “ egregiously wrong from the start ” and “ deeply damaging. ” In an extremely rare event for the Court , an unknown person with unknown motives leaked the draft opinion to Politico , which justifiably published it . A subsequent leak to CNN on Monday night claimed that the five justices in favor of overruling Roe were Bush 43 appointee Alito , Bush 41 appointee Clarence Thomas , and three Trump appointees ( Neil Gorsuch , Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett ) , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 , is prepared to uphold the constitutionality of Mississippi 's abortion law without overruling Roe . Draft rulings and even justices ’ votes sometimes change in the period between the initial vote after oral argument and the issuance of the final decision . Depending on whom you choose to believe , this leak is either the work of a liberal justice or clerk designed to engender political pressure on the justices so that at least one abandons their intention to overrule Roe , or it came from a conservative justice or clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of the justices in the majority to switch sides . Whatever the leaker 's motives , a decision to overrule this 49-year-old precedent , one of the most controversial in the Court 's history , would be one of the most significant judicial decisions issued in decades . The reaction to this leak — like the reaction to the initial ruling in Roe back in 1973 — was intense and strident , and will likely only escalate once the ruling is formally issued . Every time there is a controversy regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of radical fallacies emerges regarding the role of the Court , the Constitution and how the American republic is designed to function . Each time the Court invalidates a democratically elected law on the ground that it violates a constitutional guarantee — as happened in Roe — those who favor the invalidated law proclaim that something “ undemocratic ” has transpired , that it is a form of “ judicial tyranny ” for “ five unelected judges ” to overturn the will of the majority . Conversely , when the Court refuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who regard that law as pernicious , as an attack on fundamental rights , accuse the Court of failing to protect vulnerable individuals . This by-now-reflexive discourse about the Supreme Court ignores its core function . Like the U.S. Constitution itself , the Court is designed to be an anti-majoritarian check against the excesses of majoritarian sentiment . The Founders wanted to establish a democracy that empowered majorities of citizens to choose their leaders , but also feared that majorities would be inclined to coalesce around unjust laws that would deprive basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits on the power of majorities as well . The Federalist Papers are full of discussions about the dangers of majoritarian excesses . The most famous of those is James Madison 's Federalist 10 , where he warns of `` factions…who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion , or of interest , adverse to the rights of other citizens , or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community. ” One of the primary concerns in designing the new American republic , if not the chief concern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish rule by the majority ( democracy ) with the equally compelling need to restrain majorities from veering into impassioned , self-interested attacks on the rights of minorities ( republican government ) . As Madison put it : “ To secure the public good , and private rights , against the danger of such a faction , and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government , is then the great object to which our enquiries are directed. ” Indeed , the key difference between a pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the majority are unrestricted in the former , but are limited in the latter . The point of the Constitution , and ultimately the Supreme Court , was to establish a republic , not a pure democracy , that would place limits on the power of majorities . Thus , the purpose of the Bill of Rights is fundamentally anti-democratic and anti-majoritarian . It bars majorities from enacting laws that infringe on the fundamental rights of minorities . Thus , in the U.S. , it does not matter if 80 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law to restrict free speech , or ban the free exercise of a particular religion , or imprison someone without due process , or subject a particularly despised criminal to cruel and unusual punishment . Such laws can never be validly enacted . The Constitution deprives the majority of the power to engage in such acts regardless of how popular they might be . And at least since the 1803 ruling in Madison v. Marbury which established the Supreme Court 's power of `` judicial review ” — i.e. , to strike down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if such laws violate the rights guaranteed by the Constitution — the Supreme Court itself is intended to uphold similarly anti-majoritarian and anti-democratic values . When the Court strikes down a law that majorities support , it may be a form of judicial tyranny if the invalidated law does not violate any actual rights enshrined in the Constitution . But the mere judicial act of invalidating a law supported by a majority of citizens — though frequently condemned as “ undemocratic '' — is , in fact , a fulfillment of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic . Unless one believes that the will of the majority should always prevail — that laws restricting or abolishing free speech , due process and the free exercise of religion should be permitted as long as enough citizens support it — then one must favor the Supreme Court 's anti-democratic and anti-majoritarian powers . Rights can be violated by a small handful of tyrants , but they can also be violated by hateful and unhinged majorities . The Founders ’ fear of majoritarian tyranny is why the U.S. was created as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether the Court is acting properly or despotically when it strikes down a democratically elected law , or otherwise acts contrary to the will of the majority , depends upon only one question : whether the law in question violates a right guaranteed by the Constitution . A meaningful assessment of the Court 's decisions is impossible without reference to that question . Yet each time the Court acts in a controversial case , judgments are applied without any consideration of that core question . The reaction to Monday night 's news that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately driven by all of these common fallacies . It was bizarre to watch liberals accuse the Court of acting “ undemocratically '' as they denounced the ability of `` five unelected aristocrats ” — in the words of Vox 's Ian Millhiser — to decide the question of abortion rights . Who do they think decided Roe in the first place ? Indeed , Millhiser 's argument here — unelected Supreme Court Justices have no business mucking around in abortion rights — is supremely ironic given that it was unelected judges who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process striking down numerous democratically elected laws . Worse , this rhetoric perfectly echoes the arguments which opponents of Roe have made for decades : namely , it is the democratic process , not unelected judges , which should determine what , if any , limits will be placed on the legal ability to provide or obtain an abortion . Indeed , Roe was the classic expression of the above-described anti-majoritarian and anti-democratic values : seven unelected men ( for those who believe such demographic attributes matter ) struck down laws that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many states which heavily restricted or outright banned abortion procedures . The sole purpose of Roe was to deny citizens the right to enact the anti-abortion laws , no matter how much popular support they commanded . This extreme confusion embedded in heated debates over the Supreme Court was perhaps most vividly illustrated last night by Waleed Shahid , the popular left-wing activist , current spokesman for the left-wing group Justice Democrats , and previously a top aide and advisor to Squad members including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . Shahid — who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted a quote from Abraham Lincoln 's first inaugural address , in 1861 , which Shahid evidently believes supports his view that Roe must be upheld . But the quote from Lincoln — warning that the Court must not become the primary institution that decides controversial political questions — does not support Roe at all ; indeed , Lincoln 's argument is the one most often cited in favor of overruling Roe . In fact , Lincoln 's argument is the primary one on which Alito relied in the draft opinion to justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be imperiled , and the people will cease to be their own rulers , if the Supreme Court , rather than the legislative branches , ends up deciding hot-button political questions such as abortion about which the Constitution is silent . Here 's the version of the Lincoln pro-democracy quote , complete with bolded words , that Shahid posted , apparently in the belief that it somehow supports upholding Roe : It is just inexplicable to cite this Lincoln quote as a defense of Roe . Just look at what Lincoln said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , upon vital questions affecting the whole people , is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court , [ then ] the people will have ceased to be their own rulers. ” That is exactly the argument that has been made by pro-life activists for years against Roe , and it perfectly tracks Alito 's primary view as defended in his draft opinion . Alito 's decision , if it becomes the Court 's ruling , would not itself ban abortions . It would instead lift the judicial prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws restricting or banning abortions . In other words , it would take this highly controversial question of abortion and remove it from the Court 's purview and restore it to federal and state legislatures to decide it . One can not defend Roe by invoking the values of democracy or majoritarian will . Roe was the classic case of a Supreme Court ruling that denied the right of majorities to decide what laws should govern their lives and their society . One can defend Roe only by explicitly defending anti-majoritarian and anti-democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question should be decided by a panel of unelected judges , not by the people or their elected representatives . The defense of democracy invoked by Lincoln , and championed by Shahid , can be used only to advocate that this abortion debate should be returned to the democratic processes , which is precisely what Alito argued ( emphasis added ) : Abortion presents a profound moral issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting views . Some believe fervently that a human person comes into being at conception and that abortion ends an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly that any regulation of abortion invades a woman 's right to control her own body and prevents women from achieving full equality . Still others in a third group think that abortion should be allowed under some but not all circumstances , and those within this group hold a variety of views about the particular restrictions that should be imposed . For the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitution , each State was permitted to address this issue in accordance with the views of its citizens . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. Wade….At the time of Roe , 30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages . In the years prior to that decision , about a third of the States had liberalized their laws , but Roe abruptly ended that political process . It imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation , and it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single State . As Justice Byron White aptly put it in his dissent , the decision Court represented the “ exercise of raw judicial power , ” 410 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was egregiously wrong from the start . Its reasoning was exceptionally weak , and the decision has had damaging consequences…..It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people 's elected representatives . “ The permissibility of abortion , and the limitations , upon it , are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy : by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting. ” Casey , 505 U.S. at 979 ( Scalia , J , concurring in the judgment in part and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what tho Constitution and the rule of law demand . Rhetoric that heralds the values of democracy and warns of the tyranny of “ unelected judges ” and the like is not a rational or viable way to defend Roe . That abortion rights should be decided democratically rather than by a secret tribunal of `` unelected men in robes '' is and always has been the anti-Roe argument . The right of the people to decide , rather than judges , is the primary value which Alito repeatedly invokes in defending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens , through their elected representatives , to make these decisions . The only way Roe can be defended is through an explicit appeal to the virtues of the anti-democratic and anti-majoritarian principles enshrined in the Constitution : namely , that because the Constitution guarantees the right to have an abortion ( though a more generalized right of privacy ) , then majorities are stripped of the power to enact laws restricting it . Few people like to admit that their preferred views depend upon a denial of the rights of the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is steeped in anti-democratic values . But there is and always has been a crucial role for such values in the proper functioning of the United States and especially the protection of minority rights . If you want to rant about the supremacy and sanctity of democracy and the evils of `` unelected judges , ” then you will necessarily end up on the side of Justice Alito and the other four justices who appear ready to overrule Roe . Anti-Roe judges are the ones who believe that abortion rights should be determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roe itself was the ultimate denial , the negation , of unrestrained democracy and majoritarian will . As in all cases , whether Roe 's anti-democratic ruling was an affirmation of fundamental rights or a form of judicial tyranny depends solely on whether one believes that the Constitution bars the enactment of laws which restrict abortion or whether it is silent on that question . But as distasteful as it might be to some , the only way to defend Roe is to acknowledge that your view is that the will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that elected representatives have no power to decide these questions , and that all debates about abortion must be entrusted solely to unelected judges to authoritatively decide them without regard to what majorities believe or want .

""""""" Am I giving this guy too much credit by thinking that he doesn ’ t really mean this ? By “ this , ” I mean the part where he yammers about Cheney having gone off the deep end by using her time in the House minority to do something productive for the country , like exposing a coup attempt , instead of sitting around cutting videos for Twitter . I find it hard to believe that Dan Crenshaw , patriotic American and bona fide war hero , thinks the members of the January 6 committee have gone off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their investigation has . Either way , whether he ’ s sincere or just pandering , it ’ s pitiful . He ’ s referring ( I think ) to this tweet , which he posted on the day of the House impeachment vote in 2021 , not recently : Apparently he ’ s changed his opinion of her since then . It ’ s not clear why . “ It seems like Dan Crenshaw doesn ’ t know who he is or what he stands for . It sort of depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ’ s very Nikki Haley-esque , ” said Matt Lewis about this clip . It ’ s true ! Like Haley , Crenshaw has somehow carved out a niche for himself within the party in which he ’ s disliked by both poles . The MAGAs distrust him because of his hawkishness , with Tucker Carlson having taken to calling him “ Eyepatch McCain. ” The contempt is mutual , as Crenshaw made clear in an interview this week : Nothing made me angrier than watching Tucker Carlson have the nerve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Afghanistan ] because Joe Biden did exactly what Tucker Carlson wanted him to do exactly to the T. Pull out everybody right now , you know , no ifs , ands , or buts , no middle ground whatsoever . Not even Trump was , I think , thinking of doing that , you know , we would ’ ve at least left people in Bagram . They ’ ve [ i.e . isolationists ] been wrong on every front and it ’ s getting dangerous . You start to lose people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can ’ t have this naive outlook of the world . He ’ s clashed repeatedly with GOP populists over the past 18 months . Just last week he cringed at some of the rhetoric coming from Trumpers over the Mar-a-Lago search : “ I ’ m impressed Democrats finally got us to say , ‘ Defund the FBI. ’ That makes you look unserious , when you start talking like that. ” That led to a round of verbal sparring between him and Marjorie Taylor Greene , and not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crenshaw has also jabbed at the bombthrowers in the House Freedom Caucus , warning GOP audiences to watch out for the “ grifters in our midst. ” And last year he was confronted by an election truther at a fundraiser and shut the guy down , telling him that he ’ s kidding himself if the thinks the elections in five different swing states were rigged . Crenshaw ’ s also the guy who just put out the video above , making very clear that he wants nothing to do with off-the-deep-end Liz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal brief supporting the Texas lawsuit in December 2020 that would have overturned the presidential election if SCOTUS had ruled in Texas ’ s favor . He voted against impeaching Trump — twice ; he voted against creating a January 6 commission ; he voted against holding Steve Bannon in contempt for defying a committee subpoena . As such , Never Trumpers have no use for him , viewing him as a major political disappointment in light of the comparative courage he displayed on the battlefield . Evidently even a SEAL who ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail and run when confronted with the prospect of Donald Trump being mad at him . Here ’ s the thing about Crenshaw , though . Having pissed off MAGAs and Never Trumpers , you might think he ’ s now skating on thin ice electorally . If the populists are voting for your opponents and the RINOs are boycotting your elections in disgust , which voters are you winning , exactly ? Answer : Uh , pretty much everyone else , which is something like 60-80 percent of the party . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan Crenshaw killed it in his primary this year , pulling in nearly 75 percent of the vote . Somehow , despite the fact that he ’ s Very Online enough to be posting videos on Twitter renouncing Liz Cheney and all of her Satanic works , he seems to have assembled a large constituency back home of Not Very Online normie voters who like him just fine . The Nikki Haley half-populist/half-establishment thing is working for him , in other words , with his Trump-pleasing votes in the House apparently keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of populist excesses satisfies the center-righties . The fact that he ’ s a war hero probably doesn ’ t hurt either . Whether any of this would catch up to him if he ever runs for governor or Senate , I don ’ t know . It ’ s hard to imagine a guy who ’ s derided as the second coming of John McCain by Trumpers winning a statewide primary in a state like Texas . But now that he ’ s checked the “ I too hate the person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stage a coup ” box , maybe he ’ s viable ? I ’ d certainly rather have him in the upper chamber than Ted Cruz . """"""",0
""""""" ( LifeSiteNews ) — On October 19 , we remembered the life and martyrdom of Blessed Jerzy Popiełuszko . The priest and future saint was kidnapped by the state secret police while returning from an out-of-town Mass , bound , beaten , tied with a stone , and thrown into a reservoir . One of the reasons his martyrdom for the faith should be particularly relevant to us is that it occurred not in the time of the early Church but in Orwell ’ s year 1984 , when even some Catholics now in their 30s were alive . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a post-Cold War era in which major wars have been unthinkable and the triumph of liberal democracy was supposed to be inevitable . We have witnessed hardships in the Church , but real persecution for the faith has generally remained something from the history books . Both global geopolitical stability and the prospect of unmolested practice of faith seem now in greater doubt than at any point in our lives . It is high time to keep Blessed Jerzy ’ s example close to heart . A recent article in coastal-elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an “ extremist symbol ” and asserts its prayerful Catholics represent a “ growing contingent of Christian nationalism , ” that last term being an inane rhetorical weapon now used to demean and disregard any faithful person with undesirable views . A Slate article complains Catholic “ traditionalists who love the TLM [ Traditional Latin Mass ] can be deeply toxic. ” ( Try a Mad Libs experiment with various other religions and forms of worship inserted into that sentence . ) It further belittles actor Shia LeBeouf ’ s “ scandalous ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the well-being of children , two Associated Press investigative reporters published a September hit piece characterizing the confessional seal as a “ loophole ” to protect child abusers , a narrative the Times of London echoed . It is probably a matter of when , not if , we see in an AP story priests hauled off to jail for refusing to break the sacred seal . All this rhetoric would have been confined to the fringes of college campuses just a few years ago , but major publications seem engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credentials . Clearly , Catholics , who tend to vote 50-50 in American national elections , are personae non grata in post-Dobbs American sociopolitical journalism . Neither the president nor the Speaker of the House has offered a comment . As actions speak louder than words , these self-professed Catholic politicians need not say anything . The bureaucratic apparatuses over which they preside are clearly demonstrating the new religious-liberty landscape . Pro-life activist Mark Houck , arrested at his home last month in a dramatic display of authoritarian justice , offers one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society in which politically privileged Black Lives Matter activists can injure over 2,000 police officers , cause over $ 1 billion in property damage , and even commit murder with shockingly paltry consequences , a pro-life dad draws a heavily armed FBI squad for shoving a guy who harassed his young son . “ Persecution of the good people is always a sign of the beginning of dictatorship and tyranny , ” said Cardinal Gerhard Müller , who recently visited the Houck family home . It is the sort of tyranny that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like “ getting out the vote ” or attending city council meetings . We likely have crossed a threshold that requires a wholesale resetting of our sociopolitical landscape . Such a reset can take generations . In the meantime , we must ask ourselves : Are we prepared to be martyrs ? It is an uncomfortable question , to be sure . For help with it , we can look to the life of Blessed Jerzy . Committed to the priesthood from a young age , he endured years in a military unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young seminarians of their vocations . The ordeal didn ’ t diminish his faith , but it caused lasting health problems . As Blessed Jerzy became a nationwide source of hope and the clerical face of the Solidarity movement , the regime arrested him several times and planted weapons in his apartment . The Polish Church hierarchy sought to move him to Rome , and family members in the Pittsburgh area hoped he would join them in the safety of the United States . Blessed Jerzy resisted these life rafts . He continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ Masses for the Homeland. ” On October 13 , 1984 , the secret police attempted to cause a fatal car accident involving the famous priest , but the attempt failed . Six days later , they stopped his car on a secluded stretch of highway and abducted him . An estimated 250,000 people attended the priest ’ s funeral two weeks later ; millions have since visited his grave at St. Stanislaus Kostka Church , the Warsaw parish where he ministered to faithful workers . Today , across Poland and in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find monuments dedicated to the memory of Blessed Jerzy Popiełuszko , a martyr of our time . Often , they are emblazoned with the words Zło dobrem zwyciężaj – Overcome evil with good – St. Paul ’ s exhortation to the Romans , and one of Blessed Jerzy ’ s favorite messages to his flock . Now , at a moment that looks particularly bleak for faithful American Catholics , we should find solace in these words and in the lives of the two great martyrs who uttered them . Michael O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Danube Institute . He is an alumnus of the Hungary Foundation and Mathias Corvinus Collegium ’ s Budapest Fellowship Program .

""""""" Ukrainian solders are increasingly abandoning their positions and posting videos with complaints about their command . Why is the number of desertions increasing in the war torn country ? The total assistance of Western countries to Ukraine has already exceeded the country ’ s military budget for 2022 , which was to amount to $ 12 billion . And this is without taking into account humanitarian donations from ordinary citizens all over the world . Very soon , Ukraine will receive another $ 20 billion for its military needs from the United States . It would seem that this huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons from abroad should solve all the problems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine . However , its soldiers are increasingly abandoning their positions without authorization , refusing to go to the frontline in Donbass , and publishing video messages online in which they criticize their commanders . In this article , RT looks into why , despite foreign aid to Ukraine , the number of problems involving the deployment of military personnel is growing , and why Ukrainian soldiers are deserting more and more frequently . A scandalous bill submitted by [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy Mariana Bezugla , giving officers the right to execute servicemen for desertion , was withdrawn on May 24 . However , the very appearance of such an initiative clearly indicates that the problem is real , and the authorities are sounding the alarm . Indeed , the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Donbass are increasingly facing situations where logistical support is simply non-existent : there is no ammunition , food , or artillery support . A lot of videos have recently appeared on the web that have been posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , they confirm their unauthorized departure from the frontline , while explaining their reasons . Many of these come from military personnel in the area of Severodonetsk and Lisichansk , where the most brutal battles are currently raging in the Donbass . Perhaps one of the most sensational videos , published on April 28 , contained a message from members of the 79th Airborne Assault Brigade describing the brutality of their commanders . According to the commandos , the unit was taken to a forest near the village of Yampol in Donetsk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ We sat there for five or six days , and the commanders abandoned us… And now we are being made deserters for the fact that we survived… There are a lot of corpses still lying there in those pits. ” They stressed that they had asked for help , but the commander gave the order to “ go hand-to-hand against the tanks. ” Now , the surviving paratroopers face trials for desertion . Interestingly , after the video was published , many readers in the Ukrainian segment of the internet began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though even Ukrainian presidential advisor Alexey Arestovich confirmed it . However , a second video soon appeared , recorded by some paratroopers who confirmed the authenticity of the story in the first video and tried to explain why they had appealed to the Ukrainian people . “ I will no longer wear the uniform of this brigade , and half of us guys here feel the same , ” said paratrooper Andrey Berezinsky . Criticism of the command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by servicemen has not been uncommon in recent months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the soldiers had not undergone any training on how to dig in under artillery and mortar fire . Soldiers in Severodonetsk recorded a video in which they complained to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine , Valery Zaluzhny , about a lack of heavy weapons and reinforcements . The soldiers decried the incompetence of their commanders , who they said had remained in the rear . “ We are simply being sent to certain death . There is no combat leadership , no combat commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the military command did not appreciate that demarche and accused all the soldiers of ‘ desertion. ’ Consequently , a scandal broke out with the participation of the servicemen ’ s relatives , who appealed to the Office of the President of Ukraine for help . “ My husband went to war as a volunteer , and now he ’ s sitting under shelling in Severodonetsk . There ’ s no command , they are their own commanders . And the people who left the brigade have been put in jail as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fight without anything ? With shovels perhaps , or with what ? ” said one of the military wives . “ The 115th Brigade are not deserters ! They just throw them in like cannon fodder . They are taking on tanks with machine guns from the 80s . Why are they dying ? So that those sitting in HQ can receive stars ? ” another woman expressed with indignation . In early June , Radio France Internationale reported from a location near Severodonetsk that “ decline is brewing ” in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Donbass intensifies . “ A movement of discontent is emerging among the soldiers : they are increasingly complaining about a lack of supplies and support from their command , ” it noted , adding that the soldiers near Lisichansk describe what is happening at the front as “ hell on Earth. ” One of the main problems that greatly demoralizes soldiers remains supply . Sergeant Roman Ilchenko directly stated to French journalists that “ the Russians have artillery , armored vehicles , and their forces are five to six times greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RPGs from 1986 . A Degtyarov machine gun from 1943 . And the Maxim machine gun from 1933 . We also have a Swedish portable NLAW anti-tank missile system , but the battery did not work . This is all we had , ” Vladimir Kharchuk , a member of the 20th Battalion , said , describing his last operation . Serviceman Andrey Shevchenko believes that if the Armed Forces of Ukraine does not strengthen its artillery , it won ’ t be able to do anything . Earlier , another major foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army ’ s supply problems . At the end of May , The Washington Post reported on the arrest of Ukrainian company commander Sergei Lapko , who had recently given an interview to the newspaper . The officer told WaPo about the extremely difficult situation at the front , particularly in the area of Severodonetsk and Lisichansk . The Ukrainian General Staff , as well as the chairman of the Lugansk regional Military Administration , Sergey Gaidai , had also reported on the difficult situation of the Ukrainian military in the Lugansk Region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of such messages coming from Ukrainian soldiers right now , but Lapko ’ s story added a lot of details to the picture of what is actually happening . “ Before being sent to the front , we were handed AK-47 assault rifles and had a training session that lasted less than half an hour . When we had fired 30 bullets , we were told we would not get more because ammunition is too expensive , ” he said . When his company was sent to Donbass , twenty people refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ When we were coming here , we were told that we would be in the third line of defense . Instead , we went to the zero line , the frontline . We didn ’ t know where we were going. ” Of his company of 120 men , only 54 remained in the ranks – the rest either died , were wounded , or deserted . “ We see on Ukrainian television that there are no losses . It ’ s not true , ” the commander said . He believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve the morale of soldiers and the general public . The soldier noted that , despite all the difficulties , their troops fought bravely , but the combat had dealt heavy damage to his company , as well as to other units in the area . The Washington Post writes that most of the deaths had occurred because wounded soldiers were not evacuated quickly enough , often waiting 12 hours for transport to the Lisichansk military hospital . The soldier touched on relations with the command separately . “ Our command does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit only for our achievements . They don ’ t give us any support , ” he said . He also complained about problems with water and poor nutrition – the servicemen had to be content with one potato a day . A few hours after the interview was published , the Security Service of Ukraine ( SBU ) detained several people from Lapko ’ s company on charges of desertion . The company commander himself was suspended from duty and placed in a pre-trial detention center in Lisichansk , and his further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after his resonant interview , the Ukrainian media began to pay closer attention to video messages of soldiers describing problems at the front . As with other countries ’ armed forces , there are legislative provisions in Ukraine that hold military personnel legally responsible for desertion – article 408 of the Criminal Code . Moreover , desertion under martial law or in a combat situation provides for fairly harsh punishment – from five to twelve years in prison . However , these measures have not stopped the soldiers in some units of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their positions . Even in the initial period of the conflict , individual soldiers voluntarily left their units . Unable to withstand the harsh conditions , they decided independently to escape from the front . The first cases of group desertion began at the end of April and were associated with the deterioration of the situation for the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Donbass . At that time , the Russian Ministry of Defense stated that more than 860 soldiers had deserted from the units of the National Guard of Ukraine . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole platoon of the 115th Territorial Defense Brigade appealed to Zelensky and Zaluzhny with a refusal to carry out a combat mission near Severodonetsk . Later , a similar statement was recorded by units of the 58th Brigade and the 46th separate rifle battalion . The soldiers accused the command of throwing them into a hopeless situation as cannon fodder in order to plug the most problematic areas of the front . They had been on their way to Zaporozhye , but eventually ended up at the front near Popasna – one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did not have heavy weapons , no supplies arrived , and the command turned out to be incompetent . As a result , they suffered heavy losses and had to retreat from their positions . Literally at the same time , another recording appeared from Donbass , where the servicemen of the 71st Jaeger Brigade directly refused to carry out an order from their officers to enter the battlefield unarmed against guns and howitzers and to shoot it on video . The soldiers considered the order “ criminal ” and left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns against cannons , Grads , and mortars . No one helps us . We don ’ t have any sensible weapons , there is nothing . How can we fight for a country that doesn ’ t care about us ? ” complains one of the soldiers . “ We don ’ t want to go into the meat grinder and come out ground beef . We don ’ t have tanks , infantry fighting vehicles , guns… , ” a second echoes . At the end of the appeal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple dozen mortars and these “ only work when they want to. ” Zelensky also received an appeal from servicemen of unit 7093 attached to the Ukrainian Army ’ s 57th Brigade , who also did not like it at the front . They complained about a lack of heavy weapons and the absence of officers , most of whom had died during the fighting around Lugansk . These resonant cases indicate that , in addition to members of territorial defense units , members of regular Ukrainian Army units are also withdrawing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the Ukrainian Army has enough personnel to form new brigades , it doesn ’ t have the minimum number of armored vehicles to supply them , so it ’ s impossible to create combat-ready formations from the conscripts . At the same time , scandals are jarring the deep rear as well . Far from the combat in Stry in the Lviv Region , the relatives of fighters in the 65th battalion of the Territorial Defense ’ s 103rd Brigade staged a protest when they caught the unit ’ s commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting on the frontline . They stated that they had been sent straight to Donbass , unprepared and without weapons , instead of protecting the Lviv Region . At a meeting with representatives of the Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine , the soldiers ’ relatives demanded that the men be returned home because , according to them , they are not ready to conduct combat . “ The unprepared fighters were given a machine gun and two grenades and sent to stop an army that far exceeded our soldiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ They went to the front in their cars , which they also had to refuel themselves . They spent several hours in pits with machine guns . And , most importantly , they shot at their own retreaters . It ’ s good that there were no casualties . When the volunteers brought in walkie-talkies , the battalion headquarters took them away , ” added Galina Sidor . Many of the women also say that unprepared fighters were thrown in to stop the enemy “ with their bare hands. ” Protests have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine –Transcarpathia . In Khust , women attacked a military commissar for the fact that their men had been sent to Donbass without bulletproof vests or helmets . They accused the military enlistment office of violations and bribery . According to their information , you can get out of being sent to Donbass for $ 3,000 . There have also been claims that people with chronic heart disease or asthma are being sent to the front . “ On what basis were these unprepared people , who did not pass the medical examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front ? Specifically my husband , who ’ s had a heart attack and needs a heart transplant , ” said Inna Salautina , the wife of one of the servicemen in the 101st Territorial Defense Brigade . Nevertheless , Ukraine ’ s Ministry of Defense is in no hurry to admit its mistakes , although earlier the ministry said it would not send people to the front without prior training . At the same time , the command notes that sending territorial defense troops to Donbass from the country ’ s western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an existing law , amended on January 27 , according to which , by order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine , Territorial Defense battalions can be involved in performing tasks outside their regions on certain grounds ” said Vitaly Kupri , adviser to the Commander of the Territorial Defense Forces . Numerous cases of desertion and complaints about supplies , along with losses and voluntary surrenders , indicate that the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the defense in Donbass are experiencing great problems . Videos are increasingly appearing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are deserting . Obviously , the situation for the Armed Forces of Ukraine in this region suffers when positions are abandoned without authorization .

""""""" Today , Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal in which he vowed to do whatever it takes to bring inflation under control . “ What we need to see is clear and convincing evidence that inflation pressures are abating and inflation is coming down — and if we don ’ t see that , then we ’ ll have to consider moving more aggressively , ” Mr. Powell said , speaking Tuesday afternoon on livestream hosted by The Wall Street Journal . “ If we do see that , then we can consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ We won ’ t hesitate at all to do that , ” he said . “ We will go until we feel like we ’ re at a place where we can say , ‘ Yes , financial conditions are at an appropriate place , we see inflation coming down. ’ ” The Fed chair said that the central bank can no longer simply hope that supply chain issues improve and help inflation to fade , and that it has to instead be proactive in trying to restrain prices by cooling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates twice this year and has hinted that it will continue to raise rates at the next two meetings at least .

Here ’ s one from Pittsburgh last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same story from a station in Kansas City , Missouri : As Bernanke told the NY Times , “ The difference between inflation and unemployment is that inflation affects just everybody. ” Right now everyone trying to run a business is feeling it and the only solution is a slowing economy and possibly a recession .

She 's talking to the people HE should be talking to , and asking the questions HE should be asking before he comes into Jen Psaki 's press briefings with his idiotic assertions that the Biden administration has anything at all to do with gas prices ! Today , the Nevada Democratic senator grilled a Shell Oil company executive demanding to know exactly why they were n't doing exactly what Jen Psaki has been patiently explaining to Doocy they should be doing : working to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump . Sen. Cortez Masto pointed out , `` In recent days , major oil companies in the United States have said that they would rather use their earnings from higher prices to boost payouts to shareholders , and expand their operations slowly , rather than rush to drill new or develop existing wells . So , Ms. Hirstius , my question to you is , can you explain at a time like this , why your company would be prioritizing payouts to shareholders rather than working to increase our oil supply ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into some phrases , none of which began to answer the question . `` At this time , I think it 's important that we continue to proceed to increase all of the energy sources that we have , '' said Hirstius . `` And that includes looking at what are the levers that we have to make sure that we can add additional electrons to the system .

'' It 's possible I 'm missing some context , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the questioning session , but how exactly does the electron fit in here ? Are we being metaphoric ? Poetic ? Literal ? Regardless , there 's nothing in there that answered the question of why oil companies are prioritizing payouts to shareholders over moves that could help lower prices at the pump , so Cortez Masto reclaimed her time . `` Thank you , I only have so much time , but my question is this , directly . Why are you prioritizing your payouts to your shareholders instead of working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she repeated , and tried to phrase it differently . `` Let me ask you , would your company be willing to forego paying out dividends to pass along that relief to consumers , who are seeing high prices in my state and across the country ?

Hirstius got even vaguer with this completely useless promise : `` We are committed to continue to invest and make sure that our production does not decline . '' Cutting her losses , Cortez Masto said , `` Okay , I 've only got so much time , so let me move on here , because I did n't get an answer to my question . '' Well , she kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer is that the oil companies clearly care more about rewarding shareholders than consumers , and that while they promise not to decrease production , they 're not doing anything to increase their production either , even though they could very easily do that , helping to lower gas prices at the pump .

( Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images ) Optimism Among US Business Leaders Drops to New Low Amid Rising Inflation , Supply Issues , Labor Shortages Optimism among business leaders regarding the outlook of the U.S. economy has drastically declined in the past year , according to JPMorgan ’ s 2022 Business Leaders Outlook Pulse , released Monday . More than 1,500 midsize business leaders participated in the survey ( pdf ) , which was conducted between May 25 and June 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States that have annual revenues from $ 20 million to $ 500 million . It found that just one in five business leaders , or 19 percent , said they were optimistic about the national economy for the year ahead , representing the lowest percentage recorded in the 12 years that the survey has been conducted by JPMorgan . That figure is also down significantly from 75 percent one year ago . Amid the decline in optimism , the survey showed that pessimism around the national economy jumped to 51 percent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation and interest rates and ongoing supply chain issues and labor shortages . Meanwhile , just 9 percent of business leaders expressed optimism over the global economy . Among those surveyed , 99 percent reported that their costs of doing business have increased in the past year , with 71 percent stating that their top challenge is rising costs , including inflation . Labor issues , including recruiting , hiring , and retaining employees and labor shortages , came in at 70 percent , while 86 percent of respondents said that they believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago , along with interest rates at 65 percent . Inflation is currently sitting at a 40-year high in the United States , which has forced many businesses to pass those higher costs onto customers . Of those surveyed by JPMorgan , more than three-quarters of businesses ( 76 percent ) said they are raising prices , with 42 percent stating they have passed at least half of their increased costs to consumers via increased prices . That trend is unlikely to disappear any time soon , according to the survey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to keep raising prices in an effort to offset higher costs . Despite the gloomy outlook , 73 percent of those surveyed said they expect increased revenue or sales for the year ahead , while 71 percent are optimistic about their company ’ s performance . The survey comes shortly after a poll by Morning Consult found that optimism about the future of the United States is waning among adults . According to that survey , which was conducted on a representative sample of 2,210 U.S. adults between June 16–20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were “ very optimistic ” or “ somewhat optimistic ” about the future of the country , marking a new record low . Inflation , which the Biden administration has largely blamed on Russia ’ s invasion of Ukraine , has seen prices soaring in the United States , driving up the costs of everyday essentials including food and fuel . On June 22 , Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the Committee on Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs that the country faces an “ uncertain ” economic environment and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the horizon in the future . A number of economists and experts , including those at Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley , are forecasting a recession in the near future . “ The first half of 2022 has really tested business leaders with pricing pressures and increased interest rates , on top of the supply chain- and labor-related issues they were already facing , ” said Ginger Chambless , head of research at JPMorgan Chase Commercial Banking . “ While it ’ s surprising to see how drastically sentiment has shifted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders are still mostly upbeat when it comes to their companies and areas that they can more directly control . ” """"""",0
""""""" ‘ We the People ’ Are the New , Permanent Underclass in America This is financial tyranny . The U.S. government—and that includes the current administration—is spending money it doesn ’ t have on programs it can ’ t afford , and “ we the taxpayers ” are the ones who must foot the bill for the government ’ s fiscal insanity . We ’ ve been sold a bill of goods by politicians promising to pay down the national debt , jumpstart the economy , rebuild our infrastructure , secure our borders , ensure our security , and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of that has come to pass , and yet we ’ re still being loaded down with debt not of our own making . The national debt ( the amount the federal government has borrowed over the years and must pay back ) is $ 30 trillion and growing . That translates to roughly $ 242,000 per taxpayer . Now the Biden administration is proposing a $ 5.8 trillion spending budget that notably includes $ 813 billion for national defense , $ 30 billion to “ fund the police , ” @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit by roughly $ 1 trillion over 10 years through additional tax hikes . It ’ s estimated that the amount this country owes is now 130 % greater than its gross domestic product ( all the products and services produced in one year by labor and property supplied by the citizens ) . The U.S. ranks as the 12th most indebted nation in the world , with much of that debt owed to the Federal Reserve , large investment funds and foreign governments , namely , Japan and China . Essentially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence with a credit card . In 2021 , we paid more than $ 562 billion in interest on that public debt , which according to journalist Rob Garver , “ is more than the annual budget of every individual federal agency except for the Treasury , the Department of Health and Human Services ( which manages the Medicare and Medicaid government health insurance programs ) , and the Department of Defense. ” According to the Committee for a Reasonable Federal Budget , the interest we ’ ve paid on this borrowed money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government will spend on transportation infrastructure , over four times as much as it will spend on K-12 education , almost four times what it will spend on housing , and over eight times what it will spend on science , space , and technology. ” Clearly , the national debt isn ’ t going away anytime soon , especially not with government spending on the rise and interest payments making up such a large chunk of the budget . Still , the government remains unrepentant , unfazed and undeterred in its wanton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the difference between what the government spends and the revenue it takes in ) remains at more than $ 1.5 trillion . If Americans managed their personal finances the way the government mismanages the nation ’ s finances , we ’ d all be in debtors ’ prison by now . Despite the government propaganda being peddled by the politicians and news media , however , the government isn ’ t spending our tax dollars to make our lives better . We ’ re being robbed blind so the governmental elite can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living the American dream . We ’ re living a financial nightmare . In the eyes of the government , “ we the people , the voters , the consumers , and the taxpayers ” are little more than pocketbooks waiting to be picked . “ We the people ” have become the new , permanent underclass in America . Consider : The government can seize your home and your car ( which you ’ ve bought and paid for ) over nonpayment of taxes . Government agents can freeze and seize your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely “ suspect ” wrongdoing . And the IRS insists on getting the first cut of your salary to pay for government programs over which you have no say . We have no real say in how the government runs , or how our taxpayer funds are used , but we ’ re being forced to pay through the nose , anyhow . We have no real say , but that doesn ’ t prevent the government from fleecing us at every turn and forcing us to pay for endless wars that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than protect us , pork barrel projects that produce little to nothing , and a police state that serves only to imprison us within its walls . If you have no choice , no voice , and no real options when it comes to the government ’ s claims on your property and your money , you ’ re not free . It wasn ’ t always this way , of course . Early Americans went to war over the inalienable rights described by philosopher John Locke as the natural rights of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ t take long , however—a hundred years , in fact—before the American government was laying claim to the citizenry ’ s property by levying taxes to pay for the Civil War . As the New York Times reports , “ Widespread resistance led to its repeal in 1872. ” Determined to claim some of the citizenry ’ s wealth for its own uses , the government reinstituted the income tax in 1894 . Charles Pollock challenged the tax as unconstitutional , and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in his favor . Pollock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Members of Congress—united in their determination to tax the American people ’ s income—worked together to adopt a constitutional amendment to overrule the Pollock decision . On the eve of World War I , in 1913 , Congress instituted a permanent income tax by way of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution and the Revenue Act of 1913 . Under the Revenue Act , individuals with income exceeding $ 3,000 could be taxed starting at 1 % up to 7 % for incomes exceeding $ 500,000 . It ’ s all gone downhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has used its tax powers to advance its own imperialistic agendas and the courts have repeatedly upheld the government ’ s power to penalize or jail those who refused to pay their taxes . While we ’ re struggling to get by , and making tough decisions about how to spend what little money actually makes it into our pockets after the federal , state and local governments take their share ( this doesn ’ t include the stealth taxes imposed through tolls , fines and other fiscal penalties ) , the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rack up debt , spend outrageously and irresponsibly—with little thought for the plight of its citizens . To top it all off , all of those wars the U.S. is so eager to fight abroad are being waged with borrowed funds . As The Atlantic reports , “ U.S . leaders are essentially bankrolling the wars with debt , in the form of purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds by U.S.-based entities like pension funds and state and local governments , and by countries like China and Japan. ” Of course , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repay that borrowed debt . For instance , American taxpayers have been forced to shell out more than $ 5.6 trillion since 9/11 for the military industrial complex ’ s costly , endless so-called “ war on terrorism. ” That translates to roughly $ 23,000 per taxpayer to wage wars abroad , occupy foreign countries , provide financial aid to foreign allies , and fill the pockets of defense contractors and grease the hands of corrupt foreign dignitaries . Mind you , that staggering $ 6 trillion is only a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s military empire . The United States also spends more on foreign aid than any other nation , with nearly $ 300 billion disbursed over a five-year period . More than 150 countries around the world receive U.S. taxpayer-funded assistance , with most of the funds going to the Middle East , Africa and Asia . That price tag keeps growing , too . As Forbes reports , “ U.S . foreign aid dwarfs the federal funds spent by 48 out of 50 state governments annually . Only the state governments of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than what the U.S. sent abroad each year to foreign countries. ” Most recently , in response to Russia ’ s military aggression against Ukraine , the Biden Administration approved $ 13.6 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine , with an additional $ 200 million for immediate military assistance . As Dwight D. Eisenhower warned in a 1953 speech , this is how the military industrial complex will continue to get richer , while the American taxpayer will be forced to pay for programs that do little to enhance our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or secure our freedoms . This is no way of life . Yet it ’ s not just the government ’ s endless wars that are bleeding us dry . We ’ re also being forced to shell out money for surveillance systems to track our movements , money to further militarize our already militarized police , money to allow the government to raid our homes and bank accounts , money to fund schools where our kids learn nothing about freedom and everything about how to comply , and on and on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ’ s little we can do about it , except that ’ s not quite accurate . There are a few things we can do ( demand transparency , reject cronyism and graft , insist on fair pricing and honest accounting methods , call a halt to incentive-driven government programs that prioritize profits over people ) , but it will require that “ we the people ” stop playing politics and stand united against the politicians and corporate interests who have turned our government and economy into a pay-to-play exercise in fascism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so invested in identity politics that pit us against one another and keep us powerless and divided that we ’ ve lost sight of the one label that unites us : we ’ re all Americans . Trust me , we ’ re all in the same boat , folks , and there ’ s only one real life preserver : that ’ s the Constitution and the Bill of Rights . The Constitution starts with those three powerful words : “ We the people. ” There is power in our numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battlefield America : The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries , that remains our greatest strength in the face of a governmental elite that continues to ride roughshod over the populace .

"“The world has lost faith in the UK’s green ambitions,” says the Financial Times’ Lex column. The piece points to the country’s carbon price, which has dropped to £36 per tonne – less than half the level in the EU. It continues: “Sectors covered by the UK carbon trading system are expected to emit about 100m tonnes of carbon dioxide this year, according to consultancy ICIS. That is some 10m tonnes less than last year. Low power demand is taking a chunk of fossil fuel generation offline. Meanwhile, the supply of credit will be 118m tonnes, meaning lots going spare. The situation should persist into 2024. Emissions are expected to decline further. Yet the government in July announced it would be making additional carbon credits available. That is a recipe for continuing oversupply.” Meanwhile, Michelle Wiese Bockmann, a senior analyst at Lloyd’s List Intelligence, writes in the Financial Times that “more Russian oil than ever before is being transported on sanctions-circumventing tankers that exploit loopholes in international maritime regulations”. She says that governments “need to identify the owners behind the so-called dark fleet of elderly tankers used by Russia and an opaque network of oil traders to ship oil, and determine where these profits are directed”. Bockmann notes that nearly 40% of some 535 “dark fleet” tankers have registered ownership via “shelf companies” incorporated in the Marshall Islands. She adds: “Insurance syndicates in London that provide hull and cargo cover to the global fleet aren’t doing enough to identify whether any of the vessels they cover are involved in Russian trades.” Elsewhere, Prof Gisa Weszkalnys and Prof Gavin Bridge, assistant professor at London School of Economics and Political Science and professor at Durham University respectively, write in the Conversation that the new Rosebank oil field shows the UK’s offshore oil regulator “no longer serves the public good”. The piece continues: “The decision is out of step with demands for rapid action on climate change coming from a range of quarters. This includes shareholder activists demanding corporations accelerate decarbonisation, direct action groups such as Just Stop Oil, and financiers concerned about the risks of ‘asset stranding’ as renewables become cheaper than fossil fuels.” The authors note that the core objective of the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) is to “maximise the economic recovery of UK petroleum”. However, it adds: “A revised strategy in 2021 paired MER with an obligation to support the UK’s net-zero commitments. And the former Oil and Gas Authority changed its name to include an explicit reference to the ‘transition’ in 2022, underpinned by ambitions for emissions reduction and decarbonisation.” It continues: “A decade ago, a decision by [the regulator] would not have raised much attention. Now it highlights a significant problem in need of reform.” In other UK comment, the Daily Mail has published an editorial that opens: “A cadre of strong and articulate Tory women took the fight to Labour yesterday, challenging left-wing orthodoxy on everything from net-zero to gender self-identification.” The editorial praises energy and net-zero secretary Claire Coutinho for her “blast at green zealots and their Labour supporters, who regard the rush to net-zero as ‘a religion’”. Columnist Suzanne Moore writes in the Daily Telegraph, meanwhile, that “the Tories are clueless if they think they can ignore young voters”. She says: “Reneging on net-zero commitments, doing nothing on crumbling infrastructure, letting childcare costs soar – do Tories think that the under-40s don’t notice?” And climate sceptic Ross Clark writes in the Daily Telegraph under a headline that compares government policies designed to save lives with a battle in which more than one million people died: “The war on motorists has reached its Stalingrad.”",0

For instance , ESG funds may hold up to 20 % of their shares in non-ESG stocks , such that “ fossil fuel-free ” funds may actually hold fossil fuel companies.5 “ As a result , many “ ESG ” funds still hold major emitters like ExxonMobil , and are only marginally less carbon-intensive than the market average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t until May 2022 that the SEC announced plans to develop stricter standards for ESG labels.7 After an investigation into greenwashing by Deutsche Bank in 2021 — that led to a raid of the bank ’ s offices in Germany by German authorities8 — and a $ 1.5 million fine to BNY Mellon for “ misstatements and omissions about ESG considerations , ” the SEC is now going after Goldman Sachs .

"When you come at the king, you best not miss. House Republicans, with backing from Democrats, took a swing at Attorney General Ken Paxton and failed to land a fatal blow. In the days after Paxton was acquitted by the Texas Senate on all sixteen charges involving alleged corruption and abuse of his office, he and his allies have been positively giddy, trading memes and high fives while promising to go demon mode on their enemies. Paxton has been making the rounds on right-wing media promising retribution against a growing list of enemies, real and perceived. Defense attorney Tony Buzbee, meanwhile, posted a smiling photo of himself on Instagram wielding an antique long rifle in a back room of the Texas Senate. The reverberations from the impeachment trial are immediate. An emboldened Paxton is back at work in the attorney general’s office. The Texas House and Senate will return to town soon for a special session on whether to allow parents to use taxpayer dollars to pay private school tuition, in the form of education vouchers. This is one of the most divisive and consequential policy issues in modern Texas political history, at a time when the working relationship couldn’t possibly be any worse between House Speaker Dade Phelan and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who helped give Paxton the trial he needed. Paxton’s billionaire backers—Midland oilman and Christian nationalist Tim Dunn foremost among them—are already lining up primary challengers to take down wayward Republicans in March: a long list, given the lopsided, bipartisan vote to impeach in the House.",0
""""""" SPRINGFIELD , Ill. ( AP ) — Illinois is in the rare position of having a surplus in its bank account , which has meant Democrats who control the Legislature are competing in an election-year contest over who can give the most back to taxpayers .

I ask because I’ve never seen one put forward by the various political organisations engaged in the cause of breaking up the UK. And as the SNP gathers for its conference this weekend, one of the key issues to address will be how to amend its tactics with a Labour UK government in mind. In fairness, for the last decade in which Downing Street has been occupied by a succession of Conservative Prime Ministers, it has made sense for those seeking to diverge to use anti-Tory policies as a basis for doing so.",0

""""""" Summary . Analyzing the trend in the energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere as measured by satellites , delivers a “ natural ” climate sensitivity of 0.3 K/W/m2 . That is at , or very close to the inverse of the Planck feedback parameter as could be expected . Starting from the basic energy balance , it is shown that the high climate sensitivities as used by the IPCC are just a result from the invalid assumption that global warming is caused by greenhouse gasses only . Climate feedbacks to explain those high values are no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At present conditions it is calculated from a simple analytical expression that the IPCC climate sensitivity is 3.2x too high . That implies that the global warming as measured since 1980 , is for about 2/3rd the result of an increase in incoming solar power and can only for 1/3rd be attributed to an increase in GHG ’ s , at max . This analysis is supported by radiation data from NASA ’ s CERES-project ( 2000-2020 ) . A couple of years ago , I made a simple estimate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % brightening over the last 4 decades in The Netherlands [ 1 ] . The Royal Dutch Metrological Institute ( KNMI ) attributed only 0.2oC to that brightening [ 2 ] , whereas my methodology resulted in about 1oC . That would leave only 1/3 of the observed 1.5 oC warming to the effect of greenhouse gasses ( GHG ’ s ) . I coupled “ brightening ” to less clouds , and came to an estimate for the sensitivity to cloud change ( cc ) of about 0.1 K/ % cc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only argument against my approach boiled down to : “ sophisticated climate models tell us something different , so your simplistic model must be wrong ” . Several other methods to determine this cloud-sensitivity , all delivered similar results . Finally , I concluded that KNMI referred to cloud-feedback results from climate models , whereas I was looking to the effect of an independent change in cloudiness . Next , I compared both views against existing trends in cloudiness , surface temperatures , etc . from satellite data [ 3 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Global Circulation Model ( GCM ) -derived cloud-feedbacks delivered a climate condition close to a runaway scenario . Whereas my own idea of an independent forcing due to clouds acting as shutters ( modulating solar input ) delivered very surprisingly , that the sum of all feedbacks outside the basic Planck feedback parameter , became all of a sudden ( almost ) zero [ 3 ] . Those results confirmed my notion that high values for climate feedbacks are not real but artifacts from climate models . If temperature-induced feedbacks occur as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in itself a plausible idea , they have to be by definition “ small ” . Our climate is very stable and the Plank feedback will accommodate any perturbation from a small forcing , even from 2xCO , easily . All those feedbacks should , and are in my opinion small , 2nd order effects , or already incorporated in that parameter as confirmed by the outcome of my feedback analysis [ 3 ] . For that reason , I also used a slightly modified Planck feedback parameter for the fundamental climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Climate Model Checker ( CMC ) in my WUWT-contribution “ Outside the Black Box ” [ 4 ] . But how to prove that the IPCC/GCM climate sensitivities are fundamentally wrong ? That quest started with a kind of “ reverse engineering ” of my CMC [ 4 ] using the same data , T form HadCrut5 [ 7 ] , the greenhouse gas ( GHG ) forcing F from NASA/GISS [ 6 ] and calculate the climate sensitivity as ̶ 1/λ = ∆T /∆F ( see eq.3 further on ) over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sensitivity as a good proxy to the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity ECS , long periods of 15 years were applied for determining the average slopes in T ( t ) and F ( t ) . Results are plotted in fig.1 , but given the small ∆F values before say 1920 , one should take the values before that time , not too serious . The still rocky ( black ) curve shows that ∆T /∆F yields “ any ” value for the climate sensitivity , even negative ones during 1950-1975 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate scientists seem to have forgotten . Our climate however , is pretty stable and accordingly , effects from just incremental amounts of extra GHG ’ s over a period of 15 years , will not alter the climate sensitivity dramatically . If there was just the AGW-effect warming our climate , a smooth gradually rising temperature profile was to be expected . But what we see , looks quite different . If we translate this – 1/λ value of say the last decade 2010-2020 into a value for the ECS , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their communications , we get ~ 2oC . This is the supposed temperature increase from doubling the pre-industrial 280 ppm CO according to ΔF = 3.0 W/m2 from Van Wijngaarden and Happer [ 8 ] . Around 1980 that ECS would have been only about 1oC , but towards 1940 it would have been almost 8oC . To be followed by an extremely rapid decline towards -2oC around the fifties . Global Cooling was “ alarming ” indeed . Once , I criticized the CMIP6 forcings [ 4 ] as being too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change fig.1 . It would anyhow show this “ fingerprint ” of natural causes for global warming . Not only that other forcings are at play , but also that they must be larger than the forcing by GHG ’ s . Unless of course , our climate isn ’ t the very stable system that I assume . So , when Willis Eschenbach was so kind to share his CERES-database on WUWT [ 5 ] , I saw immediately opportunities to test that stability statement and some hypotheses I developed since these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed be easily checked with the CERES data over the period 2000-2020 . All energy streams , either in the SW- or in the LW-channel are completely fixed to their prime streams SW and LW respectively.I haven ’ t seen ratios for which the annual averages changed more than about 0.3 % over this period . Strong variations were only found between all sky and clear sky , with surprisingly different effects of clouds in either channel , and remarkable differences between Northern- and Southern Hemispheres . Those very stable all sky ratios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately works . And that implies , that we don ’ t have to know much about what ’ s going on inside this “ black box ” that we call “ climate ” , to understand the effects of perturbations . This complex climate system reflected in for instance the Trenberth type diagrams , is fully governed by these two , spectrum-wise non-overlapping energy flows SW and LW , and their values at TOA . These flows only “ touch ” each other at the Earth ’ surface where the first is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other energy flows are just “ nice to know ” . But what about these large climate feedbacks ? Fortunately , being stuck in a problem , there is always one way out : “ back to basics ” . And that climate-basics is pretty straightforward the relation between surface temperature T , incoming shortwave solar energy SW and outgoing longwave IR radiation LW , given by the Earth ’ energy balance at the top of the atmosphere ( TOA ) via : In eq.1 , C is the effective thermal capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and T a system-characteristic temperature . In practice , the surface temperature T will be regarded as the characteristic climate-temperature for obvious reasons . In equilibrium , ∂T /∂t = F = 0 . I am not going to repeat all the steps that one can find in any climate science textbook , but simply state the most important formula derived from eq.1 , starting with the general assumption that changes in radiative flux at TOA are proportional to surface temperature changes : a 1st order linear relation between the temperature change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is independent from any assumption about what ’ s driving our climate . The inverse of the constant λ can be regarded as our basic climate sensitivity . By introducing small perturbations in eq.1 , so called forcings ∆F we derive the well-known relation often used to determine the climate sensitivity : In which ∆T is the change in surface temperature T , and ∆F the “ forcing ” that induces an imbalance . The term λ , which should in principle be equal to the one in eq.2 , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in view of the climate response to compensate that forcing , and is therefore by convention “ negative ” . This eq.3 holds for a complete restoration of equilibrium and that is only at “ infinity ” . For a dynamic analysis we often see this formula with a denominator ( ∆F – ∆N ) where ∆N represents the ( rest ) imbalance at TOA . For a time period of say 2-3x the thermal relaxation time of our planet , estimated at 3-5 years , one can assume ∆N to be small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used eq.3 in fig.1 in this way to calculate -1/λ as the value of the climate sensitivity to GHG-forcings . The last important relation to be used is the expression for the Planck feedback parameter : The shortwave solar radiation SW as used in eq.1 . is in literature often written as ( 1 ̶ α ) Φ with the albedo α and the average solar intensity Φ in space . The Planck feedback parameter λ determines the way our climate reacts to disturbances in the system . It is the consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any assumptions other than that the Stefan-Boltzmann law determines the LW energy flow from the surface . Consequently , – 1/λ should also be by definition our climate sensitivity to disturbances like the effects of GHG ’ s . But apparently , climate scientists have other ideas . I shall come back on this issue , but first we are going to apply eq.2 to analyze some CERES data , in particular the radiation measurements at TOA . We ’ ll look at all sky data only . In fig.2 the values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plotted for the period 2000-2020 . These are moving annual averages to suppress all short-term variations . Nevertheless , they are still rather “ rocky ” , but their trends seem stable , and in average , going up . Their absolute values can be questioned for their accuracy , but I just need their much more reliable slopes . We rewrite eq.2 for the climate sensitivity as : One can now directly calculate the climate sensitivity that governed our climate during that period . With the slopes that the CERES data provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.41 W/m2/decade ( fig.2 ) , and from ∂T /∂t = 0.125 K/decade , we calculate 1/λ = 0.30/K/W/m2 . I could also have used the UAH LT trend of 0.13 K/decade , with 1/λ = 0.32/K/W/m2 but that wouldn ’ t have changed the conclusion that 1/λ is remarkably close to this “ basic ” Planck value of – 1/λ = 0.30 K/W/m2 as derived from eq.4 . This can not be a coincidence and clearly shows that the CERES data do not support the outcomes of GCM calculations : there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedbacks . These CERES measurements confirm what basic climate science predicts ( if not prescribes ) , that our climate is first and for all , controlled by the inverse of the Planck feedback parameter of about 0.3 K/W/m2 . We can also look at the “ stability ” of the Planck feedback parameter and see how that value evolves over time . In fig.3 , – 1/λ is plotted vs. time , as calculated through eq.4 from the values derived from the CERES data . To suppress noise , annual averages are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /T ) -1 over the period 2000-2020 . Fig.3 makes immediately clear the high stability of this climate sensitivity ( mind the scale ) with less than 0.2 % change over 20 years . But moreover , it is declining and that is contrary to what can be expected from an amplified warming effect of a high ECS with large feedbacks . Since GHG ’ s don ’ t act on the SW-channel , the nominator of eq.4 should be constant while the denominator should increase . That implies : – 1/λ should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be correct . It doesn ’ t . It simply shows that theSW component is growing instead , as already clear from fig.2 , and even faster than the surface temperature T , can follow . I haven ’ t put any model-assumptions in the above analysis , but just looked to the data . And those data don ’ t show any signs of large climate sensitivities and/or large feedbacks . How to justify this with that “ settled ” climate science ? Let ’ s first look to how and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The derivation of eq.2-4 is based on a linear approximation so , 2nd order effects could be the reason to develop λ with extra terms as those temperature feedbacks . But then , these 2nd order feedbacks should be by definition , small . In this case however , I assume those large feedbacks to be just a postulate to “ make up ” for the difference between observation/GCM calculation , and the result obtained by applying eq.3 with λ as proportionality . Fig.1 shows , that the latter simply delivers by far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calculated temperature anomalies from GCM ’ s it ’ s even worse . According to eq.3 we have apparently a large inequality , which can not be from a 2nd order effect in our climate ’ s reaction : Here the subscript AGW is used to indicate that this reasoning is coupled to the AGW-hypothesis where all climate changes are due to increasing GHG ’ s only . Now to get the “ correct ” warming associated with this “ known ” forcing , the generally accepted solution is to adapt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra climate feedbacks according to : The Plank feedback parameter keeps playing its role , but it is obvious from eq.6 that the combined feedbacks λ needs to be large and with an opposite sign to λ to get |λ | < < |λ | . Mind , that these combined feedbacks display a “ feedforward ” character and thus , enhance warming effects from GHG-forcings to fit a higher-than-expected ΔT . The arguments that this is a good idea , are all very plausible . Take the so-called Water Vapor feedback λ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which enhances water-evaporation . Warmer air can contain more water vapor . Being a strong greenhouse gas itself , more water vapor yields a higher temperature . Or take the Albedo feedback λ : higher temperatures melt the polar caps , thus decreasing the overall reflection . Less reflection implies more solar energy absorption by the Earth and so , it warms . These are all scientifically “ sound ” arguments . But at what temperature will that feedforward mechanism finally stop ? Moreover , we certainly had climate changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that GHG ’ s induce today . So , these feedbacks should already be “ part and parcel ” of the Planck feedback . What makes GHG-forcings then so special ? The analysis of λ and the climate sensitivity derived from the CERES radiation imbalance data , are giving a clear answer : nothing special ! The real issue is : climate sensitivity is a ( near ) fixed parameter , and not a freely adaptable one depending on to the kind of forcing at hand . Large feedbacks are just due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ the only show in town ” . The inequality in eq.6 can also be restored by changing ΔF while keeping λ = λ . Just accept another forcing ΔF next to the GHG-forcing ΔF , as I did intuitively in analyzing cloud-effects [ 3 ] : The subscript SW indicates a forcing that primarily acts on the SW -channel in eq.1 . That is not by speculation , but the only option to explain the positive change in SW as well as LW , as in fig.2 . The AGW-hypothesis can simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GHG-forcings only ! The reasoning behind that statement is simple : although ΔF and ΔF are both forcings that increase the surface temperature , they display rather different “ fingerprints ” at TOA . A GHG-forcing ΔF will lower LW and the climate reaction to increase T is fed by a constant SW . That increase in T will eventually restore the lowered LW to its value ( see also fig.4 ) . In case of a shortwave forcing ΔF , ΔT comes directly from this additional SW and thus , LW . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing , a GHG-forcing with e.g. , ∂F /∂t = constant , will yield ∂LW /∂t ≈ ∂SW /∂t = 0 . But a ∂F /∂t = constant i.e. , ∂SW /∂t > 0 , will yield ∂LW /∂t > 0 . Both positive slopes in the SW-case are the “ fingerprint ” at TOA as presently observed ( see fig.2 ) . Adherents to the AGW-hypothesis will immediately claim that large feedbacks affecting the SW component such as Albedo- and Cloud feedback will produce a similar pattern to that ΔF > 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle as there are a number of arguments against that claim . First of all , the strongest feedback i.e. , from Water Vapor acts on the LW-channel suppressing LW even further . Secondly , Albedo- and Cloud feedback deliver together not much more than 1 W/m2/K [ 13 ] , which can never explain the 1.38 W/m2 increase in the SW as measured by CERES . It would require an accompanying temperature increase of 1 – 1.5 oC between 2000 and 2020 , which is far beyond any observation . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible when the slopes of the two trends are much closer , in line with a much larger climate sensitivity . The analysis applying eq.5 on the CERES data in fig.2 has shown already that ( ∂SW /∂t – ∂LW /∂t ) is determined by the Planck feedback only . Other feedbacks just don ’ t play much of a role in fig.2 . There are several options for such SW -forcings . Clouds , and in particular the low hanging clouds , are for me option # 1 as they influence both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite differently . From the Cloud Radiative Effect ( CRE ) out of CERES data , we know that the net-effect favors a ΔF contribution in eq.8 , as also concluded in my earlier work [ 1 ] [ 3 ] . Since clouds do act on SW in a different way than on LW , we don ’ t even need a change in average cloudiness . A re-distribution over the various latitudes is sufficient as ( SW – LW ) varies from highly positive to highly negative , going from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Changes in the stratospheric Ozone , and/or in UV-radiation related changes due to the cyclic behavior of the Sun , provide possibilities for solar-related forcings as well . But other explanations are certainly not to be excluded . Eq.8 also clarifies a major characteristic of the AGW-hypothesis , namely ΔF = 0 . Given the options for ΔF , one could also state that the AGW-hypothesis “ denies ” natural causes for global warming . This is exactly IPCC ’ s position [ 9 ] and implicitly , also applied in GCM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options , either introduce extra feedbacks ( the AGW-hypothesis ) , or accept other forcings ( this work ) , can be easily demonstrated . Consider a climate with the option for a step-wise change at t = 0 in the GHG forcing ΔF by +/- ΔR , and for a forcing in the SW channel ΔF ( ∆SW in fig.4 ) variable in the same way : +/- ΔR . In fig.4 the evolution over time of the components that govern these two different views on their warming effect , is graphically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The final changes in λΔT from these two views , are also given and compared to the expected value in that particular scenario . Scenario # 6 shows what happens today in reality : a rising temperature combined with a rising LW but also a rising SW . Scenario # 2 reflects todays IPCC-view . Interesting are scenario # 3 and # 5 with an identical “ zero net-warming ” response . What to recommend here ? Stop emitting CO in case of # 3 ? For these scenarios with canceling forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 6 produces large , non-zero results . As expected , eq.6 yields no warming from a solar forcing only . The scenarios with GHG-forcings only , are of course correctly represented by eq.6 . All others are simply wrong . As eq . 8 “ delivers ” in all scenarios as expected , it simply shows its validity and correctness . And thus : the generally in climate science applied eq.6 , is based on the wrong assumption of ΔF = 0 . No wonder , that the IPCC still keeps this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just depends on the time and circumstances i.e. , the value of ΔF , what ECS value eq.6 yields ; just look to the facts in fig.1 . It is interesting now to calculate the ratio of the derived climate sensitivities out of both views , by eliminating ΔT in combining eq.6 and eq.8 ( with AGW and PL as the usual subscripts also for ECS ) : For the period 2000-2020 we find from the CERES data ( fig.2 ) ΔF = ΔSW = 1.38 W/m2 . From the CMIP6 forcings [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W/m2 , making the ratio ΔF /ΔF = 2.2 . The climate sensitivity that the IPCC is promoting is thus 3.2x the “ real ” sensitivity of our climate system i.e. , the inverse of the Planck feedback parameter ! This factor of 3 or more sounds pretty familiar , doesn ’ t it ? To legitimize it , the concept of climate feedbacks to bridge that gap between fake and reality had to be introduced . They look like scientifically “ sound ” effects but are not based on falsifiable physics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to compensate for the denial of natural effects that can cause global warming . From the ratio between ΔF and ΔF , it is also clear that the Sun is responsible for about 2/3 of the observed warming since 2000 , or even earlier . Whereas GHG ’ s might be responsible for the rest . Indeed “ might be ” , as I have just taken ΔF from an estimated/modelled forcing by NASA [ 6 ] . In “ Outside the Black Box ” on WUWT , I strongly questioned these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] . Nevertheless , this 2:1 ratio supports the assessment of the effect of brightening in The Netherlands [ 1 ] as well as my feedback analysis [ 3 ] . Globally , increasing SW ( fig.2 ) , must have created most of the observed warming . The growth in the atmospheric concentration of CO can only have played a minor role , as the rising LW radiation in fig.2 confirms this much larger SW-channel effect . Anyhow , the final question remains : “ what about those wrong outcomes of GCM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that most scientists behind climate models do , and have always done , their utmost to simulate Earth ’ climate to the best of their knowledge . However , making them extremely detailed with complex surfaces , coupled oceans , melting ice-caps or whatever interactions “ inside the box ” , will most probably not make a big difference in calculated climate sensitivities . On the other hand , these high sensitivities , nor these accompanying large feedbacks are explicitly entered into GCM ’ s algorithms ; they are just the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to look for the point in the process where the AGW-assumption of “ no natural forcings ” i.e. , ΔSW = 0 , has its impact and thus , “ sneaks ” into these GCM-simulations . To my understanding , that can only happen during the tuning process to generate a climate that runs over a long period with a constant behavior . Once such stability is created , that AGW-characteristic of ΔF = 0 , is an integral part of this particular climate as internal dependencies are tuned to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s to that tuned atmosphere to calculate its climate reactions , could very well deliver these exaggerated warmings . But such a stable and constant climate has never existed . History has shown strong natural fluctuations over and over again . Even during my own , human time scale , the unexplained Global Cooling of the 1950-1975 period has shown that nothing is constant in our climate . GCM-algorithms based on proper physics are probably not bad at all , except may be for the modelling of clouds . Their initial conditions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong and distorting their output . I can not come up with any other explanation , and if valid , this can easily be solved by tuning to e.g. , these CERES data or other “ known ” climate ( re-analysis ) data from the recent past . However , the real problem created with this analysis is , that forecasting with GCM ’ s has become a as long as we can not reliably forecast natural changes in SW . For the anthropogenic part it ’ s pretty clear : with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 560 ppm , even under a realistic ‘ business as usual ’ scenario [ 11 ] , there is certainly no more than about 0.4oC to go . Added after completion : In a series of posts https : //wattsupwiththat.com/2022/10/21/scatterplot-sensitivity/ , Willis Eschenbach recently published a number of scatterplots from 1×1 degree gridded CERES data . From these data , average climate sensitivities are calculated for solar radiation of 1/λ = 0.16 K/W/m2 , and for the greenhouse effect 1/λ = 0.58 K/W/m2 , respectively ( negative feedback signs are left out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by assigning surface temperatures to either pure solar ( ∆F = 0 ) , or the pure GHG cause ( ∆F = 0 ) . By taking however , the relative contribution of the forcings by solar ∆F and GHG ’ s ∆F with a ratio of 2.2 as derived from eq.8 in this work into account , the average climate sensitivity for all forcings can be calculated as : close enough to the 0.3 K/W/m2 of the inverse Planck feedback parameter , to conclude that also in Eschenbach ’ s analyses this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor . • See for a summary , https : //klimaatgek.nl/wordpress/2020/12/01/de-zon-en-de-opwarming-van-nederland/ # more-6953 ( In Dutch but on-site translation by Google-translate available ) • S.

Why did Afghanistan collapse so fast ? Was the Intel Committee under Adam Schiff focused on impeachment and not on the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the border that are on a terrorist watch list ? What are they doing about it ? Their own members on that committee say it ’ s not happening when it ’ s true . We need to have an Intel Committee that looks at what ’ s happening around the world and keeps America safe . It should do exactly what it was created [ to do ] —overseeing of our agencies and others . We ’ re going to hold people to a higher standard in the process if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the training to be a part of it . Take the politics out of it. ” McCarthy ’ s pledge to reform the Intelligence Committee and remove problematic Democrats like Schiff and Swalwell comes as the committee ’ s longtime Republican lead—onetime chairman and then ranking member now former Rep. Devin Nunes ( R-CA ) —left Congress to head up former President Donald Trump ’ s new social media venture . Rep. Mike Turner ( R-OH ) has been named the new ranking member of the committee and would presumably take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority in November . Each of these three Democrat members—and more—has a litany of problems that the standard Democrats set by removing Greene and Gosar from committee assignments opens them up to removal themselves . In the case of Schiff in particular , as chairman of the Intelligence Committee , he infamously read out a fictitious rendition of the famed call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky—where Schiff made up nonexistent call contents for dramatic effect as Democrats moved to impeach Trump the first time . He also falsely claimed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of collusion between Trump and Russians , and continued claiming there was collusion even after special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence to back up those claims—something that forced every HPSCI Republican to sign a letter demanding he resign as chairman . In the case of Swalwell , the California Democrat and failed 2020 presidential candidate had a long-running affair with a woman named Fang Fang—who the intelligence community has identified as a spy for the Chinese Communist Party . As Breitbart News has reported , a still-classified intelligence report on the Swalwell-Fang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of them . As for Omar , she has made a number of antisemitic comments over the years and also downplayed the Sept. 11 , 2001 , Al Qaeda terrorist attacks that killed thousands of Americans . “ Some people did something , ” Omar once said about 9/11 . Republicans have long wanted her gone from the Foreign Affairs Committee , arguing that her history of antisemitism should not be elevated . Given McCarthy ’ s comments here , it seems all of these issues will be addressed if and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House . McCarthy also noted that he has been trying for years to establish a select committee to investigate the Chinese Communist Party . An effort that was previously bipartisan—House Speaker Nancy Pelosi once supported it—turned partisan in 2020 when Pelosi at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic withdrew Democrat support . McCarthy moved forward with a minority-led China task force anyway , which produced recommendations on dealing with the problems a rising China poses , and hinted in this interview he may make a full committee to lead such matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ ve looked and tried to get a committee on China , ” McCarthy said . “ She [ Pelosi ] walked away from it when it took me eight months to get it—she walked away from it and you watch what ’ s happening today . Would we have the supply chain problem ? We did a China task force—we didn ’ t stop . You read through the recommendations—and those are the things we are going to implement . But America would be stronger today had we been able to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards are definitely a major problem McCarthy intends to face head on if and when he gets to the speakership , he does have issues inside the GOP conference too—as evidenced by divisions over policies and personalities . In this interview , taped in the immediate aftermath of Rep. Lauren Boebert ( R-CO ) fending off Democrat efforts to remove her from committees as well over a crude joke she made about Omar , McCarthy explained how he deals with it . “ The people that are causing this problem are not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . “ They ’ re the Democrats and the Democrat policy . The media tries to get Republicans to fight together . I believe in the Reagan 11th Commandment—we don ’ t have to be attacking one another . We know when we attack one another , we empower Democrats . We need to stop that policy from them . We need to unite together and move forward and that ’ s exactly what we ’ ve been doing , and I think members on all sides—bring them closer together , stop any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a mistake they apologize for it . They own up to it . They don ’ t harm the rest of the conference by that . Lauren Boebert made a joke , referenced something , and then she apologized to the public and then she called Ilhan Omar about it. ” To bolster his case that the media drives much of this to divide Republicans , McCarthy pointed to how during that same week Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) falsely called McCarthy the leader of the “ Ku Klux Klan conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that false smear during her press conference that week . “ In that same week [ as the Boebert/Omar controversy ] , ” McCarthy said , “ you had a member of the Democratic Party saying I was working with the Ku Klux Klan but no media asked Pelosi about that . You had Ilhan Omar , who earlier referred to my support for Israel in an earlier Congress was [ as ] ‘ all about the Benjamins ’ and never apologized . They hold these different standards . We ’ re going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The number one thing I think too is listen—not just members of Congress but Republicans across the country and your listeners—think for one moment . Don ’ t allow the pain the Democrats are causing to take our reaction off on Republicans . They ’ re not causing it . Let ’ s unite together and bring independents with us . It ’ s the policy of the Democrats . Let ’ s focus on this election. ” McCarthy has had a much different approach to dealing with members across the conference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his predecessors former Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner . “ Because I ’ m a conservative , ” McCarthy said when asked about it , before explaining how he will manage things differently than they did moving forward . “ I just think in the past the conference got too much into different identities , ” McCarthy said . “ I think we ’ re one Republican conference . I want to treat everybody equal . I understand not everyone who comes to Washington , even though you come as a Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the same . So , you ’ re going to have some difference of opinion but 90 percent of your philosophy is completely the same . So work on the things we agree upon , bring everybody in , and don ’ t think just because somebody is considered a moderate or a conservative they can only serve on certain committees . We ’ re a microcosm of society so they should be able to serve everywhere . I want to have a more open dialogue , and I ’ m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree . The one thing that happens at the end of the day is the conference elects me as leader . I ’ m going to have to make decisions . But I ’ m going to make those decisions on what I think is best for the country . Some will like it and some won ’ t . You have the ability to give me your input but at the end of the day I ’ m going to make a decision and we ’ ve all got to work towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of people going out in the party criticizing one another . That ’ s got to stop . It ’ s the Democratic policy , and I know the frustration it causes , but there are a lot of things Pelosi does that try to make Republicans fight among themselves . Let ’ s not take the bait , let ’ s focus on the American public , and work together to make that happen. ” On that note , too , McCarthy also promised that committee assignments will be made on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom Caucus or any other group will not preclude anyone from serving on key committees—a departure from how Boehner and Ryan managed such matters in the past . “ For the insiders , yeah , what people probably felt in the past ‘ oh , well if I had some belief , I couldn ’ t be on some committees. ’ Under my leadership , that ’ s never been the case , ” McCarthy said . “ You ’ ve got Freedom Caucus people who are ranking members of committees . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee there is , and you ’ ve got moderates on every single committee . No one is going to be held back . You get elected to this conference from your constituents . When you get into the conference , you get elected to your committees by your conference . Nobody should be withheld from anything . Now , that doesn ’ t mean you are guaranteed a committee . What ’ s tough is there ’ s only so many slots … but you will not be withheld from [ a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what organization internally you belong to . ” """"""",0

Voting forces people to become better informed and to consider how decisions impact their and other peoples ’ lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-engagement ... I think brings people back to getting in touch with why it ’ s so important to vote , ” she said . 7:30 a.m. : Bruce Hogan , 59 , went to vote at Third Presbyterian Church in east Charlotte because “ no one election is less important. ” “ The issues change slightly , but the election itself is very important , ” he said . Hogan arrived at Precinct 5 around 7:30 a.m. , and there wasn ’ t much of a line at the Central Avenue church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precincts , including Druid Hill and Charlotte Mecklenburg Virtual High School . Hogan said this election is pivotal because members of a particular party want to “ roll back ” time by making it tougher and more restrictive for certain segments of the population to vote . “ A democracy is established on the belief that one person equals one vote , and if all can ’ t vote , then there is no true democracy , ” Hogan said . He said the Roe v.

""""""" Legendary comedian John Cleese has warned that woke ideology has not only been “ disastrous ” for comedy , but is leading to the “ death of creativity ” in general . During an interview with Fox News , Cleese was asked if comedians today are allowed “ the freedom to be funny , ” to which he responded “ no. ” Speaking from the site of the FreedomFest conference in Las Vegas , the Monty Python star said “ There ’ s always been limitations on what they ’ re allowed to say. ” “ Why , you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , Molière had to be a bit careful . And there will always be limitations , ” Cleese continued , adding “ I mean in England , until some ridiculous late date like 1965 , all plays had to be submitted to what used to be a part of the palace called the Lord Chamberlain , and he would read it and there were hilarious letters used to go back was saying ‘ you may only say f— once , ’ this sort of- ‘ and you can not say bugger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ridiculous negotiating letters. ” Cleese continued , “ But I think it ’ s particularly worrying at the moment because you can only create in an atmosphere of freedom where you ’ re not checking everything you say critically before you move on. ” “ What you have to be able to do is to build without knowing where you ’ re going because you ’ ve never been there before , ” Cleese urged , adding “ That ’ s what creativity is—you have to be allowed to build .

So and so got into trouble , and he said that , oh , she said that. ’ You see what I mean ?

So if you ’ re worried about offending people and constantly thinking of that , you are not going to be very creative . So I think it has a disastrous effect , ” he urged .

Cleese has long been outspoken against cancel culture , previously slamming permanently offended woke people , insisting that they have no sense of humour and are contributing to the death of comedy .

"New York Times columnist David Brooks has been writing of late about how we should all just get along. In two August opinion pieces, he places the onus on the ""highly educated elite"" to take more responsibility in forming Abraham Lincoln's more perfect union. This sort of appeal has been made for a number of years now. As many on the right turned away from public health measures in a pandemic and then determined to take down our democracy, those on the left were asked why they couldn't fall in line and be … nicer. The gist of Brooks' argument seems to be that educated liberals need to take responsibility for annoying conservatives. In Brooks' view, the highly educated are also to blame for the fact that America's political culture has gotten so rancorous. Or at least we need to seriously consider that, he suggests.",0
"With its Italian Renaissance Revival facade and opulent marble lobby, the Roosevelt was one of Manhattan's grandest hotels when it opened in 1926, putting on a lavish banquet for 1,500 guests. Now, as The Mail on Sunday saw last week, an entirely different clientele is filling its 1,000 rooms, while others queue patiently outside to get in. Tired, confused and often shoving their worldly goods and families in battered wheeled suitcases and pushchairs, these newly arrived migrants – fresh off the bus from the US southern border – receive instructions from a Spanish-speaking National Guardsman in combat gear at the main entrance (few of the arrivals speak a word of English).",0
"On October 14, Australians will vote in a referendum to include an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander “Voice” in the country’s constitution. If successful, it will require Parliament to legislate for a body with the power to make representations to the government on issues concerning First Nations people. Revealingly, in recent weeks the No campaign has begun turning to anti-communist rhetoric to smear the Voice. For example, prominent No campaigner and Liberal politician Warren Mundine has tweeted on several occasions to highlight support for the Voice from members of the Communist Party of Australia, a minor group with no connection to the historic party of the same name. Similarly, right-wing journalist and campaigner Matthew Sheahan has attacked Thomas Mayo, a prominent Yes campaigner, for having communist sympathies. Sheahan’s proof is that Mayo acknowledged the role played by the historic Communist Party of Australia (CPA) in past struggles for Aboriginal rights. Mayo, however, is right to note that in the twentieth century, the CPA was one of the most consistent campaigners in solidarity with Aboriginal rights — and that’s precisely why the Australian establishment was scared of both. White Australia and the Red Menace Although the forces of communism in Australia today are not what they used to be, the frightful hobgoblin of twentieth-century communism clearly continues to haunt the minds of at least a few hard-right conspiracy theorists. A recent ABC investigation has revealed that white-supremacist No campaigners have been sharing a documentary and book produced in the 1980s by the Australian League of Rights, claiming that Native Title was a secret communist conspiracy. The example demonstrates that hysteria connecting communism and Aboriginal rights is nothing new. In part, it reflects the fact that the CPA was at the forefront of the struggle for Aboriginal rights for several decades following the party’s establishment in the 1920s. This included organizing Aboriginal workers, urging the labor movement to take Aboriginal rights seriously, and raising awareness about the ongoing frontier violence still occurring in the 1930s. This drew the ire of the Australian government, the security services, right-wing organizations, and the mainstream press. In September 1931, for example, the CPA published its first program that called for “full economic, political and social rights” for Aboriginal people. A few months later, amid the height of the Great Depression, the communist-aligned Unemployed Workers’ Movement in the New South Wales town of Bourke followed this up by demanding that the dole be extended to unemployed Aboriginal people. This caused an intense backlash in the town, and the press claimed that “Communists were spreading propaganda among the aborigines.” According to newspaper reports, as part of the backlash, “the Reds” were given an ultimatum to leave town. The connection between communism and Aboriginal rights wasn’t just a fascination of the press. The Australian government was also concerned about communists working with Aboriginal people throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In 1935, the director of the Commonwealth Investigations Branch (CIB) wrote to head of MI5 in London, saying that the “Communist Party has attempted to show an interest in the welfare of the Australian aborigines.” For the CIB director, this was “a clear indication of the depths to which Communists will go to spread their propaganda.” As Padraic Gibson has shown, many Aboriginal activists were monitored by the security services for their alleged communist links. During the Cold War era, there was continued panic that communists were attempting to use Aboriginal rights as a Trojan horse for subversion. During parliamentary debates in the late 1940s regarding weapons testing in central Australia, Northern Territory MP Adair Blain proclaimed: They used the cause of the black man — though they have no more genuine sympathy for the aborigine than they would have for a bandicoot — as a means of stirring up opinion among civilized sections of the community against the guided weapons range project. In another debate, Liberal MP Thomas White said that although people protesting against guided weapons testing in central Australia were “prompted by humanitarian motives on behalf of the aborigines,” they had been “fooled by the Communists.” Because the Cold War coincided with the breakup of European empires, Australian authorities blamed communists for unrest in the colonies and feared that they would stir up similar unrest among the indigenous population. Indeed, a number of Australian politicians drew a connection between the settler colonies of Australia and South Africa, asserting that communists were behind trouble within the apartheid regime. As Liberal MP Malcolm McColm warned, “now the Communist Party wants to bring this very problem into Australia!” The Land Rights Movement As a new era of activism around Aboriginal rights began in the 1960s, conservatives once again voiced fears that communists were embedding themselves in various Aboriginal organizations. In 1961, for example, the Bulletin reported that communists had become part of the Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights, and warned that “a politically naïve, uninformed, disgruntled people could prove dangerously malleable, particularly when they have genuine grievances.” And these warnings did not go unheeded by the establishment. As Lachlan Closely has demonstrated, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) kept a close eye on supposed communist influence on the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI). By the 1970s, the issue of Aboriginal land rights had gained prominence, reinforced by a broader radical upswing in Australian society as a result of the anti–Vietnam War movement. Again there was suspicion that communists were involved, acting in an underhand manner. ASIO viewed the new generation of Aboriginal activists — including people Gary Foley, founder of the Black Power movement in Australia — as communist agents. Consequently, in January 1972, when Foley and others erected the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in front of (Old) Parliament House in Canberra, ASIO put it under heavily surveillance, and made a point of recording any interactions between Aboriginal activists and communists or Trotskyists. The right-wing premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was among the most inflammatory, explicitly claiming that the land rights movement was a secret communist conspiracy. In Queensland’s parliament in 1982, Bjelke-Petersen spoke at length about this supposed communist plot, declaring that, the objective of the radical land rights movement is to create a separate black nation, outside the laws of Australia, capable of contracting with overseas nations hostile to Australia in the future. He concluded his speech by reading from a letter by far-right figure Phyllis Cilento, which detailed “a Communist long-range plan to alienate Aboriginal lands from the Australian nation so that a fragmented North could be used for subversive activities by other countries.” As the Queensland premier warned darkly, “this plan is now coming to fruition.” Phyllis Cilento and her husband Sir Raphael Cilento were both supporters of the Australian League of Rights, a far-right organization that had existed since the 1940s. A 1991 national inquiry into racial violence described the Australian League of Rights as “undoubtedly the most influential and effective, as well as the best organized and most substantially financed, racist organization in Australia.” Eric Butler, the league’s leader, made several trips to Rhodesia while it was under minority rule and met with Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith. And the league’s program was pro-empire, pro-apartheid, anti-communist, antisemitic, and anti-immigrant, an agenda wrapped up in paranoid conspiracy theories about a new international order run by Jews and communists. In 1982, the publishing arm of the League of Rights — Veritas — produced a book, Red Over Black, that was also cited by Bjelke-Petersen. Written by former-CPA-member-turned-right-winger Geoff McDonald, Red Over Black claimed that the Aboriginal land rights movement was part of an international communist conspiracy to take over the country by stealth. The book went through several editions in the 1980s and 1990s, and today, the League of Rights still sells it via its website. Thanks to the No campaign, Red Over Black has enjoyed a renaissance in popularity, and a documentary version has been shared by different far-right groups in recent years, such as the Australian One Party, run by fringe right-winger Riccardo Bosi. The aforementioned ABC investigation shows that a far-right Telegram channel, Aboriginal Voice Exposed, has shared the documentary, while another channel, Blacklisted Research, has adapted the video to “specifically attack the Voice.” The ABC also reports that both channels have previously posted antisemitic material.",0

""""""" Trying to get an error removed from your credit report can often seem like an exercise in futility , sucking up time and energy — that is , if you can reach the companies that manage your all-important financial data in the first place . That 's the upshot of an analysis from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , which said this week it received more than 800,000 complaints from January 2020 to September 2021 from people about dealing with Equifax , Experian and TransUnion , the three dominant credit bureaus . Most of those complaints centered on consumers being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputes resolved , the CFPB said . `` Consumers described the burden associated with attempting to correct inaccurate information , which can be compounded when they are managing other personal issues , '' CFPB officials wrote in a report released Wednesday . In the report , the CFPB said Equifax , Experian and TransUnion collectively resolved less than 2 % of the credit report complaints they received in 2021 , down sharply from 25 % in 2019 . Translation : Thousands of Americans disputed an error on their credit report last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ultimately still failed to get their problem addressed , the CFPB said . A person 's credit record affects them in myriad ways , from qualifying for a mortgage or renting an apartment to buying a car and even getting a job . As a result , fixing errors on a report is vital since that affects your credit score . But the major credit bureaus are failing on that front , according to CFPB Director Rohit Chopra . `` America 's credit reporting oligopoly has little incentive to treat consumers fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' said CFPB he said in a statement Wednesday , adding that the `` report is further evidence of the serious harms stemming from their faulty financial surveillance business model . '' Problems with credit agencies are starting to overshadow every other complaint consumers submit to the CFPB .

Equifax , Experian and TransUnion declined to discuss the CFPB report and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade group — the Consumer Data Industry Association . The association said in a statement Wednesday that it 's `` reviewing the CFPB report in detail . '' `` The CFPB report highlights trends including increased activity by certain credit repair companies , which can inflate complaint numbers and undermine the process of addressing legitimate requests , '' the association said . The rise of credit monitoring and repair apps like Credit Karma are at the center of why credit agencies often fail to fix errors on a person 's report , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans are using Rapid Credit , Credit360 and Credit Karma to check their scores and dispute inaccuracies . So what 's the problem ? Equifax , Experian and TransUnion view those apps as third-party entities that submit disputes on behalf of a consumer . Although there 's a federal law that allows consumers to use third parties to initiate disputes , the credit agencies `` ignore this obligation and , instead , do not respond when they suspect that a third party was involved in the submission of the complaint , '' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three major credit reporting agencies have long drawn scrutiny for their practices , including the difficulty consumers report in getting the companies to correct their credit records .

They highlight the potential strength of the left’s electoral base and suggest that tacking to the right on migration to win back the working-class vote is a political dead end. In a nutshell, we studied the determinants of voting behaviour using data gathered at municipal – “commune” – level, covering every election (legislative and presidential) between 1848 and 2022 and the main referendums held between 1793 and 2005.

"Unfortunately, the app’s search function is garbage. Much like Instagram, Threads only lets you browse for accounts, not keywords. And because the community is built entirely on the back of a visual app—one that is not particularly useful for rapid, text-based updates—it tends to be popular with cultural and visual creators. Thus, finding any information about the fires was nearly impossible. I searched high and low to see if any of the helpful Twitter accounts also had accounts on Threads; I couldn’t find any. The National Weather Service has no Threads profile at all, let alone local affiliates. In desperation, I simply searched “Oregon” to see if I could find any fire news from the accounts affiliated with the state. I didn’t see any posts, but I did see some lovely flower footage on the Visit Oregon account. In my weeks of using Threads, I’ve found that the algorithm seems to prioritize serving me verified users who are popular in sports, culture, and art, rather than news sources. According to Meta executives, this is on purpose: The head of Instagram said earlier this month that Threads would purposely not try to cultivate hard news but focus more on “sports, music, fashion, beauty, entertainment.” If this is really going to be the positioning of Threads moving forward, that’s not only bad news for media accessibility but also for disaster response. Important posts about fires or floods seem doomed to take a back seat to Dane Cook’s musings. This is not to say that there won’t one day be a natural disaster big enough to break through the Threads algorithm, or that one of the other platforms will become popular enough to supplant Twitter. But the power of Twitter—or X, as Musk has rebranded it—was never its popularity. Even at its zenith, Twitter was much less commonly used than Facebook and Instagram.

He says it will be bad and it will change our world forever . Folks…I ’ m putting all of this together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuke on New York City . But that was just the beginning… He had a lot more to share , I think maybe 6 or 7 different prophetic words all in this one video . They are all incredible and mindblowing but my favorite was the one near the end where he said he was given an open vision from God where he saw President Trump and his team walking in with all the evidence . No way for it to be spun or ignored . And he said they walked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen before ( and Trump is normally a confident person ) . But they had it all . They marched it right into the Supreme Court and from there they went and retook the House of Representatives . You need to listen to Barry tell it . And last , before I give you the video , I want to recap the very end of the video where he gave a specific prophetic word to someone named Samantha . He said there ’ s a Samantha out there who has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes her situation and he says here ’ s your sign , I ’ m calling you out by name in this video ! And I just kind of have a feeling that the Samantha he ’ s talking about is reading this article and so I want to specifically call this out so if that ’ s you I don ’ t want you to miss this . If your name is Samantha and you feel cut to the core right now because of what you just read , you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen for the word Barry has for you on what you need to do next . There we go ! Covered ! And now for everyone else , please enjoy this one and please , please , please stay safe this weekend ! Today is 9/22 and Barry says this event will happen in the next few days… So that would be roughly 9/24 or 9/25 . And do you know what ? He ’ s far from the first person to say it , in fact . We ’ ve been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WeLoveTrump and I want to remind you of some of those stories . Remember what the Vatican just did ? ALERT : Pope Francis Orders All Church Funds To Be Sent To Vatican By September 30th ! Do NOT underestimate the global power of the Vatican . It would be reasonable to be concerned after seeing the unprecedented step Pope Francis just took . What ’ s funny is I just had Bo Polny on my show last week and he told me the EXACT same thing . He didn ’ t know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his research is showing something historic ( and not good ) comes in September . You can see that here : Should you be concerned ? And in case you think the story isn ’ t real , it ’ s confirmed . ABC News has reported on it here : Pope Francis on Tuesday imposed an Oct. 1 deadline for all Holy See offices and Vatican-linked institutions to deposit their assets with the Vatican bank . Francis ’ decree follows his decision earlier this year to entrust management of all Vatican assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as APSA — in a bid to end decades of mismanagement that culminated with a scandal over a 350 million-euro investment in a London property . Ten people , including former Vatican officials and external brokers , are on trial in the Vatican tribunal on finance-related charges related to the deal . The Vatican ’ s economy ministry in July issued a new investment policy requiring all Vatican departments to transfer their assets and investments to APSA via its accounts at the Vatican bank , known as the Institute for Religious Works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given , but the decree published Tuesday says all assets must be transferred by Sept. 30 . The need for a new decree imposing a fixed deadline and stressing there were no exceptions to the regulation suggests some offices or institutions were hoping to keep external accounts or investments . The Vatican bank has long been mired in scandal but has spent the past decade cleaning up its books and ridding itself of its reputation as an offshore tax haven . Years of reform have slimmed down its client list to Vatican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embassies . And also from the Catholic News Agency : Pope Francis has ordered that the Holy See and connected entities move all financial assets to the Institute for Works of Religion ( IOR ) , commonly known as the Vatican bank . The pope ’ s rescript , issued Aug. 23 , clarifies the interpretation of a paragraph in the new constitution of the Roman Curia , Praedicate Evangelium , promulgated in March . According to Francis ’ rescript , financial and liquid assets held in banks other than the IOR must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 days of Sept. 1 , 2022 . The IOR , based in Vatican City State , has 110 employees and 14,519 clients . As of 2021 , it looked after 5.2 billion euros ( $ 5.6 billion ) of client assets . Though commonly called a “ bank , ” the IOR is technically a financial institute , with no branches , working within Vatican City State to provide services to clients , which include the Holy See and connected entities , religious orders , clergy , Catholic institutions , and Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of clients decline by 472 , from 14,991 clients at the end of 2020 to 14,519 in 2021 . Nearly half of its clients in 2019 were religious orders . According to its annual report , the financial institution ’ s $ 19 million net profit in 2021 was also down from $ 44 million in 2020 and $ 46 million in 2019 . You can see the actual edict posted on Vatican.va here : And from our friend Sarah Westall : Why has Pope Francis ordered all Vatican affiliated entities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vatican Bank ? Francis ’ rescript specifies that all financial and liquid assets held in banks other than the IOR must be moved to the Vatican bank within 30 days of Sept. 1 , 2022 . The IOR stands for , Institute for Works of Religion . According to the National Catholic Register the IOR is not a bank , but rather a financial institution : Though commonly called a “ bank , ” the IOR is technically a financial institute , with no branches , working within Vatican City State to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy See and connected entities , religious orders , clergy , Catholic institutions , and Holy See employees . The IOR saw its number of clients decline by 472 , from 14,991 clients at the end of 2020 to 14,519 in 2021 . Nearly half of its clients in 2019 were religious orders . According to its annual report , the financial institution ’ s $ 19 million net profit in 2021 was also down from $ 44 million in 2020 and $ 46 million in 2019 . There are multiple reason the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be transferred to the IOR . One reason could be the imminent collapse of the international monetary system that has been predicted by economists for many years now . Jim Rickards , one of the most respected economists in the world , had this to say recently : Look , I ’ ve been studying monetary economics for about 50 years . All of my research has led me to one conclusion — we ’ re going to see the collapse of the international monetary system . When I say that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper currencies around the world . It ’ s not just the death of the dollar or the demise of the euro . It ’ s a collapse of confidence in all paper currencies . Over the past century , monetary systems have changed about every 30–40 years on average . Before 1914 , the global monetary system was based on the classical gold standard . Today , the existing monetary system is over 50 years old , so the world is long overdue for a new monetary system . Others believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial records as their involvement in extreme corruption has been getting out to the public . As reported by many independent journalists over the years ( although ignored by the mass media ) , the Vatican has been involved in some of the most horrendous crimes against children possible . The move is interesting on a number of levels . In the first place , it is a remarkable use of the canonical power of a rescript issued by the pope — to instruct that a text be interpreted in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning . The move is so remarkable , in fact , that some canonists have asked if it might be a mistake — a case of the canonical sections of the instruction being published prematurely , or absent necessary legal vetting . But , assuming Pope Francis means what he has written , there is a more substantial assessment to be offered of the move : that the pope is casting a dramatic vote of confidence in the IOR . While the bank has been at the center of some of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since 2014 , it has been the subject of several financial reforming efforts , with hundreds of accounts closed and charges filed against former officials at the bank . In January , the former president of the IOR became the first person to be handed a jail sentence by a Vatican City court for financial crimes . And it was the leadership of the IOR which first flagged as suspicious the Secretariat of State ’ s London property deal , after Cardinal Parolin pressured the bank to approve a 150 million loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sostituto Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra ordered a retaliatory investigation into the bank ’ s director for denying the request . The bank is now widely held to be the most transparent and credible financial institution the Vatican has — in large part because it is subject to international standards and inspections by financial watchdogs . Crucially , the IOR , as a commercial bank , is the only Vatican financial institution subject to the oversight of the ASIF , the Holy See ’ s internal financial watchdog , and to Moneyval , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspectorate . Although Francis did not provide a rationale for his change on Tuesday , concentrating competence for managing all Holy See investments in the IOR could be aimed at enhancing oversight and regulatory compliance . The most recent Moneyval assessments have repeatedly singled the IOR out for praise in its reforming efforts , even while warning about its wider concerns about the Vatican , including at ASIF . During recent hearings in the ongoing Vatican financial trial , former ASIF officials told the judges that they lacked oversight authority of the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were essentially powerless to intervene in the London deal as it unfolded until the secretariat tried to involve the IOR . Meanwhile , APSA itself has faced repeated questions about its adherence to both Vatican and international financial norms , and shifting asset management responsibility to the IOR could be , at least in part , a response to those concerns . While APSA previously provided commercial banking services and accounts to select individuals , like cardinals and members of the papal household , the use of those accounts was linked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes , and ending those services was a key priority of financial reforms under Cardinal George Pell , who was appointed by Pope Francis as the first prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy in 2014 . In 2015 , the ASIF , concluded that APSA was no longer an “ entity that carries out financial activities on a professional basis , ” and so was exempted from future ASIF and Moneyval inspections . Nevertheless , in 2019 , the head of APSA , Bishop Nunzio Gallatino acknowledged that APSA had provided a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretariat of State in 2014 , a violation of its undertakings to ASIF and Moneyval which led to the 2015 exemption . The money went to fund a for-profit enterprise to acquire a Catholic hospital , which had collapsed under 800 million euros of debt related to money laundering , embezzlement , and fraud charges . Cardinal Parolin later acknowledged that he had acted to secure the loan from APSA , despite a 2012 prohibition on such loans , and when the loan was not repaid , APSA had to write off 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out its profits for 2018 . In June of this year , APSA partially financed a 100 million euro deal to rescue another scandal hit Catholic hospital in Rome , this time linked businessman Gianluigi Torzi , who is also on trial in the Vatican for extortion , committed a multi-million euro fraud against the hospital . With the exception of APSA ’ s real estate management role and the work of Cardinal Kevin Farrell ’ s commission of reserved financial matters ( state secret expenditures , essentially ) , Pope Francis has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and investment management activity to the IOR — the only Vatican institution under the oversight of ASIF and Moneyval .

""""""" WASHINGTON ( FTC / News Release ) – The Federal Trade Commission today sued Walmart for allowing its money transfer services to be used by fraudsters , who fleeced consumers out of hundreds of millions of dollars . In its lawsuit , the FTC alleges that for years , the company turned a blind eye while scammers took advantage of its failure to properly secure the money transfer services offered at Walmart stores . The company did not properly train its employees , failed to warn customers , and used procedures that allowed fraudsters to cash out at its stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint . The FTC is asking the court to order Walmart to return money to consumers and to impose civil penalties for Walmart ’ s violations . “ While scammers used its money transfer services to make off with cash , Walmart looked the other way and pocketed millions in fees , ” said Samuel Levine , Director of the FTC ’ s Bureau of Consumer Protection . “ Consumers have lost hundreds of millions , and the Commission is holding Walmart accountable for letting fraudsters fleece its customers. ” In addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services to consumers in its stores , including money transfers , credit cards , reloadable debit cards , check cashing , bill payments and more . Walmart acts as an agent for multiple money transfer services , including MoneyGram , Ria and Western Union , offering some services under its own brand , like “ Walmart2Walmart ” and “ Walmart2World. ” According to the complaint , tens of millions of money transfers are sent or received at Walmart stores each year , where they are processed by Walmart employees . Money transfers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a recipient in another location . They are frequently used by fraudsters across a wide variety of scams because they are nearly impossible to retrieve after the money has been picked up . The FTC has brought multiple cases against money transfer services in recent years , including against MoneyGram and Western Union , alleging they failed to protect consumers who used their services . Walmart ’ s practice of turning a blind eye to fraud had grave consequences for consumers , according to the complaint . The complaint cites numerous instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scammers relied on Walmart money transfers as a primary way to receive payments , including in telemarketing schemes like IRS impersonation schemes , relative-in-need “ grandparent ” scams , sweepstakes scams , and others . Based on information from fraud databases maintained by MoneyGram , Western Union , and Ria , from 2013 to 2018 more than $ 197 million in payments that were the subject of fraud complaints were sent or received at Walmart , with more than $ 1.3 billion in related payments also possibly connected to the fraud . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s money transfer practices showed , according to the complaint , that Walmart knew about the role money transfer services play in scams and frauds . Despite that , the company ’ s money transfer services harmed consumers in numerous ways , including : • Allowing the payout of suspicious transfers : For years , according to the complaint , it was Walmart ’ s stated policy for its employees to issue payouts even in the case of a suspicious money transfer , making it easy for scammers to retrieve fraud proceeds at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Walmart reference guide for employees that stated : “ If you suspect fraud , complete the transaction. ” Walmart did not begin training employees to deny fraudulent payouts until at least May 2017 , but even then it provided this training only to employees at a limited number of locations . • Having no anti-fraud policy or an ineffective , poorly enforced policy : According to the complaint , despite offering money transfer services for many years , Walmart did not have a written anti-fraud or consumer protection program until November 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cites numerous instances in which Walmart failed to have an effective program or violated its own policies , as well as the policies of its partners , like MoneyGram , that were ostensibly in place to protect consumers from fraud . • Allowing cash pickups for large payments : The complaint notes that Walmart , unlike most other outlets where money transfers can be received , pays even large payments in cash . In addition , the complaint notes that scammers were often able to retrieve their payments from Walmart by using fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option for fraudsters looking to conceal their identities . • Not providing materials to prevent consumers from sending fraudulent payments : According to the complaint , Walmart failed to display or provide required materials to consumers at many of its locations that could have warned them about potential frauds and stopped them from sending money to scammers . More recently , the company stopped using a paper “ send form ” that included important information for consumers to help them realize they may be making a bogus payment , replacing it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . • Failing to effectively train or retrain staff : The complaint alleges that Walmart ’ s training materials for the tens of thousands of employees who worked with money transfers was often contradictory or unclear . In many cases , employees who were authorized to handle money transfers as “ backups ” received no anti-fraud training at all or only limited training related to transfers . The complaint notes that in some instances Walmart staff were complacent or complicit in scams , accepting cash tips from scammers in exchange for processing fraudulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scams themselves . • Allowing money transfers to be used for telemarketing purchases : The FTC ’ s Telemarketing Sales Rule has since 2016 prohibited money transfers from being used to pay for telemarketing purchases because of the high risk of fraud . But the complaint alleges that , for years , Walmart failed to take steps to comply with that provision . The Commission vote to file the civil penalty complaint was 3-2 , with Commissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine S. Wilson dissenting .

"Over the weekend, Republican US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy struck an eleventh-hour deal with Democrats on a new budgetary deal. The 45-day continuing resolution (CR), agreed to by the Senate and signed by President Biden, narrowly avoids a federal shutdown. In this Q&A , Thomas Gift discusses how the two sides came together, what the compromise means for policy, and how it will impact partisan relations going forward. What do you make of Kevin McCarthy working with Democrats to avert a shutdown? This isn’t an ideal bill for either side of the aisle, by any measure. But for Republican House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy to compromise with Democrats, then dare the far right to rebel proves that he can stand up to extremists in his party. Critics will say that a CR isn’t any way to govern, and that’s right. But you have to ask yourself: compared to what? McCarthy is navigating an opposition Senate, and a hardline GOP caucus determined to undermine him. Considering the hand he’s been dealt, it’s hard to say McCarthy didn’t do all that he could. Substantively, the temporary budget doesn’t give up too much of what Republicans wanted. Politically, McCarthy also protected the interests of moderates in his party. Still, McCarthy’s bipartisanship comes at risk to his own speakership. We’ll know soon enough if Rep. Matt Gaetz’s threat to oust him is real or just a bluff.",0
""""""" Suddenly , stories are appearing about Hunter Biden ’ s assistant — the one he had during his association with corrupt Chinese energy company CEFC — being a suspected Chinese honeypot , as if this were some new revelation . Readers of this newsletter have been aware of this for some time , though we did not allege a sexual affair , and there still doesn ’ t seem to be evidence of that . The story broke in the U.K. Daily Mail over a year ago . Here ’ s their updated version . This was during a particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and JiaQi ( “ Jackie ” ) Bao was extremely focused on him , writing him three-page , single-spaced letters musing about all sorts of things . She strongly encouraged him to get his father — “ Uncle Joe ” — to run for President and even provided him with opposition research to help his dad ’ s campaign . American Thinker has a…thoughtful…piece that concludes , “ If Bao was indeed a Chinese agent , she held him in the palm of her hand. ” The reason this is news again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistleblower who ’ s come forward to confirm that , yes , she was a spy . But back in January of this year , Peter Schweizer , in his book Red-Handed , mentioned her by name and said she ’ d been employed by the Chinese government ’ s National Development and Reform Commission as a research assistant . Then she went to work for an investment firm called OpenGate Capital , which had known ties to the CCP . So , along with her move to the CEFC , her employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chi-Comms . And in 2017 , when Hunter Biden went into business with CEFC , she was “ assigned ” to him . It ’ s hard to imagine they would “ assign ” any person to him who wouldn ’ t be spying . As House Oversight Committee member James Comer of Kentucky says , it ’ s yet another “ national security nightmare ” connected to Hunter Biden . JiaQi ( “ Jackie ” ) Bao certainly did prove invaluable to Hunter in brokering the deal between CEFC and natural gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short-term Chinese assistant be so interested in getting “ Uncle Joe ” elected as President ? Leftists , predictably , have focused on the somewhat indelicate phrasing of Rep. Comer ’ s comments about the Chinese assistant so they don ’ t have to think about the national security ramifications of Hunter ’ s relationship with her . Comer was even accused of being racist towards Asian women , when he was talking specifically about women enlisted to spy for the CCP . One stellar tweet that reveals the leftist mentality : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] they are sh** scared of the upcoming J6 hearing , not to mention the DOJ/FBI catching Trump red-handed stealing classified documents. ” If you ’ d like to read more inane drivel , here ’ s a link , but please don ’ t feel obligated to go there unless you want an excuse to pound your head against the wall . Also , concern about this is not sexist towards “ very attractive ” ( Comer ’ s words ) lady spies . Recall that Hunter himself referred to CEFC ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spy chief of China. ” ( Bao came to Biden ’ s office after being Ho ’ s assistant . ) We still don ’ t know how much of an exaggeration this comment might be , but spy chief or not , he was tried in 2017 in the Southern District of New York for bribing African leaders at the UN on behalf of CEFC , was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison . From October 2020 . Interestingly , the 2017 news story from CNN about Ho being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection at all . It must have been a closely-held secret then . As it happens , that ’ s not the only spy story for today . Just as the Chinese spied on Hunter , so Hunter , through his attorney , allegedly spied on the crew that was filming the movie My Son Hunter last November . In an update , filmmaker Phelim McAleer has filed an ethics complaint with the California State Bar against Malibu lawyer ( and Hunter ’ s neighbor and so-called “ sugar brother ” ) Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie . Morris allegedly flew in on a private jet and pretended to be an independent documentary filmmaker so he could find out more about McAleer ’ s Hunter project . As the complaint alleges , he was “ performing legal investigative work on behalf of his client , Mr. Biden. ” McAleer ’ s complaint says , “ Mr . Morris intentionally concealed from us that at the time of this conversation and during the many hours of filming and interviews that he was retained by Mr. Hunter Biden. ” In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris intentionally misrepresented to me that he had never met or spoken with Mr. Biden… ” This attorney , through his misrepresentation , gained full access to the set and the actors for several days , and it ’ s estimated that he and his team left with about 40 hours of film . Morris also represents Matt Stone and Trey Parker , the creators of South Park , and allegedly used his 25-year relationship with them as cover while spying on the My Son Hunter set .

""""""" When the Academy announced that Beyoncé would perform at this year ’ s Oscars , Bey stans and casual fans alike were shocked . Music ’ s most iconic diva is notorious for two things : setting the pulse for the entire music industry at large , and doing it infrequently or without warning . Because if there ’ s one thing we know about Queen Bey in the golden prime of her career , it ’ s this : Beyoncé does not leave the house unless she wants to . She rarely does interviews ( in print or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists mainly of photo dumps ( just in her case , they ’ re of her dressed head to toe in designer clothing on a yacht off the coast of some island we didn ’ t even know existed ) ; and she does not show up to awards shows unless absolutely necessary . This is , of course , particularly evident in her diminished presence at the Grammys—an awards show her husband , Jay-Z , publicly boycotted for years . In recent years , both Beyoncé ’ s and Jay-Z ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at best . She ’ s only attended the MTV Video Music Awards three times since 2014 and made sporadic Grammys appearances in the last half-decade , and she hasn ’ t shown up in person to the BET Awards since 2016 . Take last year ’ s Grammys , for example . Beyoncé led the pack in nominations but declined to perform , leading fans to believe that she and Jay-Z wouldn ’ t attend the ceremony . But Beyoncé did show up , late , to surprise and congratulate Megan Thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their remix of “ Savage. ” She also stuck around to accept her own win for Best R & B Performance . Though this award solidified her as the record holder for the most Grammys ever won by a female artist , it also underlined a telling , frustrating truth : With 79 nominations as of 2021 ( 28 of which she ’ s won ) the awards show has only granted her one singular award in a major category , 2010 ’ s Song of the Year for “ Single Ladies ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” This year , Beyoncé decided to give the awards circuit another chance by performing her Best Original Song contender “ Be Alive ” from King Richard at the Oscars . Opening the show with her first awards show performance in five years , she ( with her usual background dancers and extensive band ) gave an astounding and beautiful performance . But she didn ’ t do so in the actual Dolby Theatre ; instead , Beyoncé and co. appeared on tennis courts in Compton , California ( and decked out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homage to tennis queens Serena and Venus Williams , whose father is the subject of King Richard . Then , she surprised us all when she actually showed up to attend the awards in person ( but not until much later , of course ) . But viewers who might have thought opening the show with Beyoncé would ensure that the rest of Oscars night would be boring by comparison turned out to be wrong—in the worst way possible . After I recovered from my initial shock at Will Smith slapping Chris Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then going on to win Best Actor minutes later , the first thing I said was Beyoncé ain ’ t never leaving the house again . Though Beyoncé is used to being overlooked come awards season—she lost her category last night to “ No Time to Die ” by Billie Eilish—I ’ m here to tell you that this is probably not the reason the good sis doesn ’ t regularly anoint us with her presence on these occasions . It ’ s most likely because she is tired of the mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our TVs during awards season with our popcorn and wine in hand , hoping for some drama to rush to Twitter about , Beyoncé has witnessed a shocking amount of it in front of her own eyes . To hammer it in , let ’ s take a quick tour of her front-row seat to some of the most chaotic awards moments in recent memory . Kanye West vs. Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards Of course , we ’ re starting off with one that needs no introduction : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard round the world . When a young Taylor won the Moon Man for Best Female Video with her “ You Belong With Me ” music video over Beyoncé ’ s “ Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) , ” Kanye stormed the stage to interrupt her , famously announcing : “ Imma let you finish , but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time. ” Of course , instead of leaving her out of a narrative that actually had nothing to do with her , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s reaction , capturing her incredibly embarrassed shock in perpetuity . This moment put Kanye and Taylor on a public roller coaster of friendship that involved an apology , leaked phone call , disturbing music video ( now something of a trend for Kanye ) , and Kardashian feud . Later that night , Beyoncé actually won Video of the Year and graciously invited Taylor Swift back onstage to finish her earlier acceptance speech . The 2009 MTV VMAs … again : Lil Mama Stage-Crashes Jay-Z and Alicia Keys While Jay-Z and Alicia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mind ” to close out the very same awards as Kanye ’ s outburst , Lil Mama decided to crash the stage . Caught up in the New York energy , Brooklyn rapper Lil Mama hopped on up at the end of the song , something Alicia Keys didn ’ t even notice at the time . Beyoncé even tried to intervene before Lil Mama made it onstage , but the rapper ’ s need to join in was too powerful . Her husband ’ s problem quickly became hers too—and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . In 2014 , TMZ acquired footage of a physical altercation between Beyoncé ’ s sister , Solange Knowles , and Jay-Z in the elevator of a Met Gala afterparty . Beyoncé , situated between the two , memorably kept her composure and mainly stayed out of the fight , while security held Solange back from attacking Jay-Z again once the doors opened . Though the cause of the altercation remains a mystery , the common assumption is that it was due to Jay-Z ’ s infidelity , which would become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genre-defying album Lemonade . As the only event on this list to directly involve the Knowles-Carter family , it ’ s important to note that they published a statement of reconciliation shortly after . Since then , the event has been iconically alluded to in songs by both Beyoncé and Jay-Z , though the former took a cheekier approach than the latter . Since then , the couple appearing at the annual fundraiser has been like wishing on a star , to say the least—rare and unpredictable . In another memorable moment directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you : the 2017 Grammys . Beyoncé ’ s Lemonade , nominated for several awards that year , is hailed as her defining work , her magnum opus , and an actual cultural reset in music—a towering feat for an artist who had already been considered the best of the best for decades . Everyone naturally expected Beyoncé to win Album of the Year in 2017 . Instead , after winning Best Urban Contemporary Album , Beyoncé lost the biggest award of the night to Adele ’ s 25 . Mind you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved the award by giving an incredible 10-minute performance while pregnant with twins . Adele then got onstage and told the world in a heartfelt not-acceptance speech what we already knew : that the Academy had given the award to the wrong artist , and it should have been Beyoncé ’ s all along . Beyoncé teared up and mouthed “ I love you , thank you ” back to her , and we all cried . Needless to say , Beyoncé and Jay-Z have only attended the Grammys twice since then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major award both times . And Now This : Will Smith Slapping Chris Rock at the 2022 Academy Awards It was a surprise to see Beyoncé and Jay-Z seated in the Dolby Theatre audience hours after her opening performance . It probably shouldn ’ t have been : The winner in her category , Best Original Song , was slated to be announced soon after she was seated . I imagine she was as shocked as Lupita Nyong ’ o when Will Smith made a controversial ( to say the least ) move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jada ’ s honor ( though viewers pointed out that Queen Bey is no stranger to family scandals ) . There ’ s not much I will say about yesterday ’ s baffling onstage moment that hasn ’ t already been said , but I will leave you—by which I mostly mean rich and famous people—with this : As a Beyoncé stan , I rather enjoy when she decides to grace us with her presence . So can y ’ all please deal with your drama when she ’ s not around instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch you duke it out ? It could be that Beyoncé actually enjoys the drama , but I ’ d like to think that she ’ s tired of it—I know I ’ m tired , and if Twitter ’ s any indication , everyone else is too . If Beyoncé decides to never show up at an awards show again , then we all lose . I ’ m begging you , on Beyoncé ’ s behalf : Get it together . """"""",0

"In a result having implications for the next UK general election, the Scottish National Party (SNP) has suffered a disastrous by-election defeat in the largely working class constituency of Rutherglen and Hamilton West, part of the conurbation around the city of Glasgow. The result has been hailed by Labour as proof that it is on course for a general election victory next year. In a campaign in which social issues dominated, the Labour Party won the Westminster parliamentary seat with 58.6 percent of the vote, against the SNP's 27.6 percent, marking a 20.4 percent swing to Labour since 2019 and overturning a 5,230 SNP majority. The dramatic outcome is being taken as an indicator of a sharp shift away from the SNP towards Labour which, if replicated across Scotland, would hand 42 seats to Labour and contribute significantly to putting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer into 10 Downing Street. Labour, formerly by far the dominant party in Scotland, has, since 2015, been reduced to one, now two, Westminster seats. The SNP still holds 44, most all of them won from Labour in the last decade. Labour held over 40 seats in Scotland from 1964 to 2010, before being electorally obliterated. Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has previously viewed 23 SNP seats as vulnerable.",0
""""""" So it is that some of the most intriguing developments related to the Jan. 6 , 2021 , attack at the Capitol may derive from documentarians who were accompanying figures central to the day ’ s events . There was the crew accompanying Donald Trump ’ s longtime adviser Roger Stone who offered insights into both how Stone scrambled to get out of Washington that day and his interactions with members of the right-wing extremist group the Oath Keepers . And there was a documentarian filming members of another extremist group , the Proud Boys , whose experiences with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first public hearing of the House select committee investigating the attack . The Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers sit at a weird spot in the galaxy of events that surround the Capitol riot . According to federal indictments , each group arrived at a similar approach — be in Washington on that day , ready to fight — through different rationales and with different preparation . Neither was the sole nor necessarily even the central reason that the riot occurred , but that each organization had multiple members who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted federal law enforcement to obtain sedition-related indictments . Members of the Oath Keepers were indicted on such charges in January ; a superseding indictment adding seditious conspiracy charges against Proud Boys members was published Monday . It ’ s worth noting at the outset that the Proud Boys are an independent organization that nonetheless overlaps with Trump ’ s political world . Stone was friends with Enrique Tarrio , the Proud Boys ’ leader in the period between the 2020 election and the Capitol riot . As the Armed Conflict Location & @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , “ Proud Boys activity has been strongly correlated with the fortunes of former President Trump. ” The group had earned a reputation for engaging in street violence with perceived political leftists , but by 2020 its focus was clear : ACLED notes that 97 of the 152 demonstrations in which Proud Boys participated that year “ were explicitly in support of then-President Trump. ” Importantly , nearly all of those events came after Trump called on the Proud Boys to “ stand back and stand by ” when asked to denounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is likely that Trump simply fumbled the demand that he ask the Proud Boys to “ stand down , ” but the group took Trump ’ s words at face value .

""""""" Earlier this month , scientists published a finding suggesting that reduced activity of a particular enzyme is associated with a greater risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome , a mysterious condition that killed about 1,250 infants under the age of one in the United States in 2019 . The study , published May 6 in eBioMedicine ( a Lancet journal ) , offers preliminary evidence suggesting that measuring this cholinergic enzyme in living infants could indicate a newborn ’ s risk of SIDS . But experts tell The Scientist that the study itself oversells its findings—and that subsequent news coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , reaching the point of incredulity . “ Sydney researcher who lost son to SIDS makes breakthrough in preventing ‘ every parent ’ s worst nightmare ’ , ” a tweet from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation exclaimed on May 7 . Other early coverage of the paper was even more zealous . “ Researchers Pinpoint Reason Infants Die From SIDS , ” read the headline of BioSpace ’ s heavily shared article about the paper on May 10 . “ As the cause is now known , researchers can turn their attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded at the time . Parenting Twitter was elated . “ THEY FOUND THE CAUSE OF SIDS , ” exclaimed a tweet from @ TheDebbieMia that , at the time this article was published , had received more than 279,000 likes and 66,000 retweets . Lead study author and SIDS researcher Carmel Harrington tells The Scientist via email that she was surprised by the study ’ s exuberant reception . “ I was hoping that this work would grab the attention of researchers in my field , because the more of us researching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results will come , but I did not expect this level of attention , ” she says . “ In science the message is nuanced and it is easy for non-scientific people to misinterpret scientific language. ” “ By way of clarification , ” Carmel , who works at The Children ’ s Hospital at Westmead in Sydney , adds , “ a biomarker does not equal cause and what we have found is a potential biomarker and not a cause. ” But experts who spoke to The Scientist were deeply critical of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comments from Harrington herself that suggest that the study could help prevent SIDS . For instance , a May 7 press release from The Sydney Children ’ s Hospitals Network ( with which Harrington is affiliated ) —which sparked much of the study ’ s initial coverage—includes quotes experts say go too far , such as : “ This discovery changes the narrative around SIDS and is the start of a very exciting journey ahead . We are going to be able to work with babies while they are living and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also claimed to the press that SIDS will “ be a thing of the past ” within three to five years—an assertion that ’ s experts tell The Scientist is unrealistically optimistic and risks giving parents false hope . “ I would say there ’ s enough here for us to look further , but the idea that it ’ s gone around the world as a cure for SIDS just shows that there are real problems with social media , ” says Richard Goldstein , director of the Robert ’ s Program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston Children ’ s Hospital and Harvard Medical School , who was not involved in the research . He and others say they are concerned that the breathless coverage not only oversells the paper ’ s results , it could actually result in more children at risk if parents rely on prospective biomarkers in the place of tried-and-true prevention methods such as safe sleeping practices . Harrington tells The Scientist that the study arose from a popular hypothesis that many SIDS deaths stem from the infant ’ s inability to rouse themselves from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the existing literature ties the neurotransmitter acetylcholine ( ACh ) to arousal , and , subsequently , deficits in acetylcholine to SIDS . Because the enzymes butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ) and acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) modulate ACh activity , Harrington explains that she “ hypothesized that a deficit in the cholinergic system may well be evidenced by an abnormal level of one or both of these enzymes. ” To probe this question , she and colleagues determined the levels of AChE and BChE in dried blood samples taken from infants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown reasons and compared them with the levels of those enzymes in blood taken from living babies . The SIDS samples contained lower levels of BChE than the living or non-SIDS death groups , which Harrington explains can be used as a proxy for ACh levels and , therefore , as a potential indicator of an infant ’ s risk of death from SIDS . “ This finding represents the possibility for the identification of infants at risk for SIDS prior to death and opens new avenues for future research into specific interventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ I stress it is not a cause , but a marker of vulnerability . We know that not all infants with low BChE will die , and we need to better understand the complexity of this system . Future research will do this. ” However , the relationship between SIDS and BChE is less convincing than some of the paper ’ s press coverage might suggest , experts say . For one , the findings differ somewhat from those of prior biomarker studies , including a 2010 PLOS ONE study that found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIDS cases compared to healthy controls—and that levels of the enzyme increase with age , which is noteworthy given the living babies analyzed in the new study were older than the deceased infants considered . Furthermore , as researcher K. Iceman notes in a Twitter thread , a figure from the paper suggests that there is actually very little difference between the SIDS and control groups , calling into question the paper ’ s key assertion that BChE could be a useful biomarker . In an email conversation with The Scientist , Iceman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Harrington relied on public donations to fund the research and continues to ask for crowdfunding support . Eugene Nattie , a Dartmouth emeritus professor whose research focused on the neuroscience of breathing , tells The Scientist that he had reservations about the study , and passed along a newsletter by Brown University economist Emily Oster arguing how the study , though not invalid , was vastly exaggerated to the point of being misleading . Noting that a particular problem was the oft-repeated refrain that screening for BChE levels would help prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ pretty much sums up my thoughts. ” And experts point to other weaknesses in the research . In addition to the overlapping error bars , Goldstein notes that some infants ’ data were excluded from the study , leaving only a handful of newborns in the SIDS group , and that little is known about their exposure to other , more established risk factors such as exposure to secondhand smoke or having their mother smoke during pregnancy . Still , he says he likes the premise of the study and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . It ’ s simply “ extremely preliminary , ” he says . “ I think their methods are fine , but I just don ’ t think you can claim very much other than ‘ very interesting study , let ’ s move forward ’ , ” Goldstein adds . Harrington didn ’ t respond to specific critiques , instead telling The Scientist , “ I think it is really important that this study engages scientific debate and critique. ” It ’ s perhaps unsurprising that so many social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infant dies of SIDS , their family members are rarely given any explanation as to how their child died or whether it was preventable . The autopsy procedure typically conducted is woefully outdated , says Goldstein , as it lacks a genomic screen that might actually prove useful for SIDS research . Because of that , the medical examiner is only able to offer families in search of answers the equivalent of a shoulder shrug . What mourning parents are left with , however , is the knowledge that any future children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will face a greater risk of SIDS—and that scientists can not yet explain why . The ordeal , as Goldstein describes it , is not remotely comforting . Harrington shares that she was driven to unravel the mysteries of SIDS after losing her son to Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood ( SUDC ) , which is similar to SIDS but for children older than one year . She was unable to accept that no one could tell her why it happened , she says . For those who have lost children to SIDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their child ’ s death , no matter how tenuous , may come across as much-needed reassurance that they ’ re not to blame—or suggest that there ’ s hope for future infants . Such sentiments were all over social media after the press release and early coverage of the paper : “ This is momentous . Parents of babies lost to SIDS can now know it ’ s not their fault , despite being told it ’ s from blankets or belly sleeping or overheating . Relief finally for these already heartbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had more than 60,000 likes before it was deleted . “ I 'm hoping this can at least provide an answer for grieving parents & eventually a cure , ” says another . As many have noted , it ’ s hard to blame the tweeters , given the way the research was presented initially . Reporters and the public simply repeated hyperbolic statements made in the press release—like that the findings could render SIDS a thing of the past in a matter of years . And while one could argue those covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligence , one can hardly expect the average non-scientist on Twitter to pore over the error bars of a figure deep in a scientific study . An interesting but perhaps over-celebrated study wouldn ’ t necessarily pose much of a problem , Goldstein says , except that some of the writeups of the study that were widely shared suggest that a biomarker test could replace current recommendations for preventing SIDS , which include safe sleep practices meant to prevent the asphyxiation that experts say remains important regardless of biological risk factors . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be prevented if they took proper precautions , ” the BioSpace article initially said , for instance . “ These families can now live with the knowledge that this was not their fault , ” it goes on to quote Harrington as saying . “ The dangerous part is that some of those tweets say , ‘ You see , it ’ s not sleep position , ’ ” Goldstein says . “ Actually , there ’ s no way that you can take that away from this study . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defect needs to be stressed . But somehow , as always happens with the social media world , it just becomes twisted. ” “ I ’ ve already seen a ton of tweets about parents relieved that they can let their babies sleep on their tummies , ” reads a tweet from Iceman ’ s thread . “ NO , you should not ! ALWAYS on the back and on a safe surface ! ” Some of the initial coverage of Harrington ’ s study has been edited post-publication to reiterate the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting those measures were outdated . BioSpace , for instance updated their headline to more accurately reflect the nature of the work and added a clarification that “ despite this breakthrough , it is still abundantly important that anyone caring for a baby should follow safe sleeping practices. ” And The Sydney Children ’ s Hospitals Network added , “ While these findings do offer some hope for the future , parents are strongly encouraged to continue following safe sleeping practices including placing babies on their backs to sleep , keeping their head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safe sleeping environment in both the day and night ” to its original release . But experts ’ and clinicians ’ concerns linger that parents may miss the corrections and may falsely believe safe sleeping precautions are now unnecessary . Even if that ’ s not the case , the mental whiplash from the abrupt change in messaging may undermine confidence in future SIDS studies . And exaggerations of findings—whether from the researchers directly , in press releases , or in social media posts—can undercut people ’ s trust in scientific research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of demeans science , ” he says . Finding the true “ cause of SIDS ” may be impossible One thing the hype got right is that figuring out the mechanisms underlying SIDS would be a momentous breakthrough . Just last week , Goldstein wrote in a commentary piece in the New England Journal of Medicine that identifying the molecular and genetic factors that result in increased SIDS risk is crucial . But one major challenge to that goal is the fact that the condition is what Goldstein calls “ a heterogeneous collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnostic dustbin , ” referring to the way SIDS is given as the cause once all other known causes of death are ruled out . His and other research has convinced him that there are likely multiple variations of SIDS out there , each with its own risk factors and demographics resulting in the same outcome . Better genomic profiling and screening can help differentiate among subpopulations of vulnerable infants , he notes , allowing scientists to take the crucial first step of defining what the problem is . Indeed , as genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been identified over the years , they ’ ve helped rename certain conditions as distinct from SIDS—effectively whittling away at the remainder of SIDS that remains shrouded in mystery . In that sense , research like Harrington ’ s can serve as important pieces of the puzzle . But celebrating incremental progress as a breakthrough may hold the field back , Goldstein says . “ What we need to do is to make the leap beyond just these very crude , superficial , circumstantial observations to things that are more rooted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultimately , our ideal is not to explain factors contributing to what happened , but to prevent it from happening ; to treat whatever it was or prevent the trigger. ” But much like the danger of positing lofty goals such as preventing all heart attacks or aneurisms , Goldstein cautions that the complete prevention of sudden infant deaths may be a pipe dream . “ I don ’ t think we can do that with a thing that is called ‘ SIDS . ’ ” """"""",0

The adherents of that select group of self-professing elites from around the world who come together at the WEF ’ s annual meeting in Davos , Switzerland , are brainwashed victims of Schwab ’ s envisaged New World Order .

The WEF also has a youth wing called the ‘ Global Shapers Community ’ : 9,655 ‘ shapers ’ work from 428 ‘ hubs ’ in 148 different countries to infiltrate politics and promote Schwab ’ s evil nonsense . On 29 August 2022 the US House of Representatives at long last introduced a ‘ Defund Davos ’ Bill ( HR8748 ) which will follow Trump ’ s previous efforts to deny the use of taxpayer funding to support the WEF.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-important charlatan who calls himself the ‘ Executive Chairman ’ of the WEF , made an absolutely astonishing statement at the annual meeting of 23 May 2022 . In a glowing tribute to Ukraine ’ s Nazi allied President Volodymyr Zelensky , who was the WEF ’ s ‘ guest of honour ’ ( ! ) and the main speaker during his international tour to solicit weapons for fighting Russia , Schwab said that Zelensky ( a man who gives awards to avowed Nazis , imprisons opposition leaders and bans parties ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international order ” .6 There was not a single cheep of protest or dissent from the almost 2,500 leaders present drawn from politics , business , civil society and the media.7 Instead , Zelensky , whose speech had omitted mentioning any reference to the crimes that nationalist extremists had committed in his country , or the fact that he had breached the Minsk Agreements which were intended to achieve a peaceful solution to the Ukraine conflict , received a standing ovation after having in effect virtually thanked Ukraine ’ s Nazis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ volunteers ” .8 Zelensky and Schwab are two of a pathological political kind . Rodney Atkinson has exposed Zelensky ’ s intrinsic Nazism in two very important articles on his ‘ Freenations ’ website ; 9 I have repeatedly drawn attention to a photograph of Zelensky proudly holding up a Nazi T-shirt adorned with a large Swastika and symbols of the German Wolfsangel ; and ‘ The True Reporter ’ website has similarly asked why some photographs of Zelensky show him wearing the Nazi Iron Cross.10 Yet there are ignorant and simple-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors of Christian newspapers among them – who have not done their research and who dismiss such overwhelming evidence of Zelensky ’ s Nazi credentials as fake or because they are sympathetic to him and do not want to recognise the truth . On 15 July 2021 the Ardara Press published a detailed study of the hidden Nazi past of Klaus Schwab ’ s family company , Escher Wyss , which amongst other barbarities exploited slave labour and Allied prisoners of war and manufactured key nuclear bomb-making technologies for Adolf Hitler.11 Two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian website ‘ Grandmageri ’ . The author recalls that the company was protected not only by Hitler himself , but by Switzerland , Britain and America , making Schwab a criminal foreign meddler in every sense . Hitler called Escher Wyss “ a national socialist [ i.e. , Nazi ] model company ” . The Ardara study also mentions that CIA archive documents reveal that the Swiss engineering companies Escher-Wyss and Sulzer were being directed by the US Department of Energy and the State Department , and the author asks : “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spy running the “ Great Reset ” and “ Build Back Better ? ” 12 Biden , Johnson and Trudeau have all used the WEF concept ‘ Build back better ’ when demonstrating their support for Zelensky and Ukrainian Nazism . The World Economic Forum is just a long-winded way of saying fascism . Horrendously , the WEF has even called on governments , health officials and “ humans ” around the globe to consider the “ rational ” ( ! ) arguments for implanting microchips in children ’ s brains . Schwab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ tracking chip in your child ” isn ’ t “ scary ” , arguing that chips “ form part of a natural evolution that wearables once underwent ” and that children will even grow to see them as “ accessories ” that will eventually be “ considered a fashion item ” .14 YouTube has produced a revealing video in which this evil plan for control of the human brain is discussed.15 The fundamental pillar of the Great Reset is a horrendous plan called ‘ Agenda ID2020 ’ ,16 which is a blueprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objectives of the super-rich . Aided by the methods of the ‘ Big Tech ’ platforms , it promotes the idea of a massive population reduction . Agenda ID2020 was designed by Microsoft billionaire and Bilderberg member Bill Gates , who has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce the world population by the use of vaccines . This is no figment of anyone ’ s imagination : read Gates ’ own words : “ The world today has 6.8 billion people… that ’ s headed up to about 9 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great job on new vaccines , health care , reproductive health services , we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent. ” 17 This damning statement by Gates echoes the Nazis ’ eugenics programme , which never disappeared but merely faded into the background for a few decades . Agenda ID2020 is backed by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , the Rockefeller Foundation , Accenture , and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization ( GAVI ) , which is now simply called the Vaccine Alliance . GAVI is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has its headquarters in Geneva , Switzerland , significantly next door to the World Health Organisation . These organisations collaborate collectively in promoting Schwab ’ s planned New World Order . Immeasurable and lasting damage has already been done to the health , economies and freedoms of the world ’ s nations by what has been called the WEF ’ s “ gathering of psychopaths trying to play God ” ; 18 but their end may now be nigh following a Swiss referendum held on 7 March 2021 , which blocked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for an electronic identity system based on Agenda ID2020 . The overall rejection rate was 64.4 % ( in some Cantons up to 70.7 % ) 19 and was a massive blow to the World Economic Forum ’ s evil project . It will be interesting to see whether Schwab and his supporters will now be ousted from Davos , just as Hungary expelled billionaire globalist George Soros in 2019 for his “ subversion politics ” against the country and what the Jerusalem Post described as his “ campaign of global chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West ’ s failing anti-Russia conspiracy The WEF ’ s official slogan reads “ Committed to improving the State of the World ” , but the Davos meetings have done absolutely nothing to achieve such a goal . Schwab has never made any suggestion of how peace might be achieved in a pointless war that has killed many thousands of innocent people – many more Ukrainians than Russians . Instead of accepting the Putin-Lavrov proposals for peace negotiations , it was clear that the hidden ( or perhaps not so hidden ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . As Peter Koening pointed out in a recent New Eastern Outlook article : “ The applause [ following Zelenski ’ s belligerent tone and demand at WEF 2022 for more killing-power from the West ] was like enhancing the propagated and truly indoctrinated hatred for Russia within the Forum and around the world. ” 23 Thus the WEF 2022 finally exposed its true geopolitical credentials by formally announcing that it had “ severed all relations with the Russian Government and President Vladimir Putin ” and “ scrubbed Putin from the WEF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mouthpiece for US-NATO propaganda and aggression . Hence , apart from vastly increasing corporatism or economic fascism , the WEF ’ s Great Reset is also aimed at destroying Russia – and China – and recovering the dwindling hegemony of the Western nations as they rapidly lose their global leadership in an increasingly multipolar world . Accordingly , the Great Reset is not a conspiracy theory , but a conspiracy in practice . Michael Rechtenwald of the Mises Institute , which is the world ’ s leading supporter of the ideas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concludes that as “ plans of a technocratic elite ” it is “ doomed to fail ” : “ The Great Reset [ … ] is not a conspiracy theory ; it is an open , avowed , and planned project , and it is well underway .

The vast majority will not accept the Great Reset ’ s attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , governmental , and technological prison . Like earlier attempts at totalitarianism , the Great Reset is doomed to fail. ” 25 The WEF ’ s planned New World Order demolished by Russia and China Considering that America is rapidly accelerating into a police state ruled by Joe Biden and the Democrats , and that the European Union is also facing potential final collapse over its Covid-19 fiasco and the WEF-engineered energy crisis , the question now is : Who is left with the courage , the conviction , the strength and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Reset which Klaus Schwab was so intent on reiterating to the world ’ s globalist elites at the 2021 Davos teleconference of the WEF ? The answer is , of course : the very person who since 2015 has recognised , exposed and openly denounced the aims of Schwab and his duped followers – the bogeyman relentlessly misrepresented and systematically demonized by the West , namely Russian President Vladimir Putin . Despite accelerating into global tyranny,26 the Great Reset is destined to fail , though its promoters will desperately try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . Putin was absolutely right when he mocked Schwab ’ s plans at the WEF ’ s 2020 meeting , which ironically had to be held online because of the Covid-19 pandemic . Putin told Schwab that his plans for a system of global government based on the ridiculous ideas of the Great Reset were not only “ doomed to failure ” but were also “ counter to everything that modern leadership should be pursuing ” .27 When world leaders gathered at SPIEF 2022 ( the St Petersburg Economic Forum ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia and China just destroyed Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum ” .29 To paraphrase the main points of what Putin made absolutely clear in St Petersburg : The era of the unipolar world , led by America and the WEF ’ s Great Reset , is over . The future world order , already in progress , will be formed by strong sovereign states . The rupture with the West is irreversible and definitive . No pressure from the West will change it . Russia has renewed its sovereignty . Reinforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute priority . The EU has completely lost its political sovereignty : the current crisis shows the EU is not ready to play the role of an independent , sovereign actor ; it is merely an ensemble of American vassals deprived of any politico-military sovereignty . Sovereignty can not be partial : a country is either sovereign or a colony . Russia will invest in internal economic development and reorientation of trade towards nations independent of the US . The future world order , already in progress , will not be the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but will be formed by strong sovereign states . It is a lesson that the godless West will be made to learn the hard way . The stupendous impudence of a man who presumes to arrogate to himself the role of creating a new global order in which “ you will own nothing and you will be happy ” 30 emerges from the content of Schwab ’ s absurd books The Fourth Industrial Revolution ( 2016 ) , its successor Shaping the Future of the Fourth Industrial Revolution ( 2018 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Reset ( 2020 ) .

The following transcript from Viganò ’ s call to action in an interview on the ‘ Russian Faith ’ website puts the Great Reset in its true Satanic perspective : “ If we observe the way in which the Great Reset and pandemic farce have been carried out , we notice that nothing of what has been done by the globalists has been inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that what inspires their criminal action is theological hatred of God the Creator and Saviour ; what allows the spread of the planet-wide fraud is lies , blackmail , deceit , and corruption ; everything for them begins and ends in the name of death , sickness , and terror .

"(JTA) — For almost nine months, Israelis have been fighting over the future of their Supreme Court. Today, that battle has moved into the Supreme Court itself. In July, Israel’s hardline right-wing governing coalition passed a law to weaken the court. Opponents of the law then filed legal challenges against it. That put the court in the uncomfortable, and unprecedented, position of ruling on itself: It can decide to uphold the law, strike it down, or send it back to parliament to be amended. When Israelis on both sides of the debate warned that the country was headed to a constitutional crisis, this is what they meant. Today’s hearing is raising questions no one knows the answer to: What happens if the court strikes down the law, and the government doesn’t respect the court’s ruling? Who takes precedence — the court or the coalition?",0
"Noise in the political sphere, calm in the classroom. The ban on the abaya, the traditional tunic in some Muslim countries, considered an indication of religious or cultural identity, has come into force this week in French schools amid an intense debate on secularism and its application in the education system. The Council of State must decide by September 7 whether the measure is legal and respects fundamental freedoms. So rare is the wearing of the garment that the law appears to be addressing an issue that is all but anecdotal. Of the 12 million French pupils who returned to school on Monday, 298 arrived wearing the abaya and 67 refused to remove it, and were consequently sent home, according to provisional figures from France’s Ministry of Education which banned the Islamic veil and any other garment or accessory with religious connotations, from the Christian cross to the Jewish skull cap, in 2004. “Outside of the classroom, pupils have the right to dress as they want,” says Christine Guimonnet, a history and geography teacher at the Lycée Camille Pissarro in Pontoise, north of Paris. “But, when they come to class, they cannot wear clothes that indicate a religious affiliation.” At her high school, Guimonnet has not experienced any cases of pupils wearing the abaya this week; last year she had to tell one student to take it off.",0

These relationship-building activities have helped to forge a powerful alliance in Brussels between select politicians from the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) and those with a commercial interest in slowing moves to more nature-friendly farming: pesticide manufacturers and farming unions linked to industry.

""""""" The Democratic Party has in recent years turned a new corner , in which it has become increasingly clear that its politicians don ’ t necessarily require their full mental capacities in order to be revered . If we weren ’ t talking about our bumbling Commander-in-Chief here , we could instead discuss the elevation of John Fetterman to Pennsylvania senator . Fetterman , as you know , can hardly produce an intelligible sentence . The ability to clearly communicate and demonstrate full cognitive functions is no longer a necessary trait for leftist leaders , it would seem . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following on the heels of former Senator Joe Biden , our sitting president , who for many moons has found himself seemingly unable to reach the end of a speech without having made numerous errors in diction . Biden is known to be combative with virtually anyone who questions his agenda , including constituents . As time has gone on and the full reality of that agenda has come to light , critics have grown steadily in number . At the time of writing this article , almost 60 % of Americans disapprove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And some of that may stem from his public speaking . Most recently , this month , Biden struggled to get out an unknown word , possibly “ apoplectic ” in a stand-off with a reporter who was asking a relatively routine question . In early fall , Biden ’ s scary senior moment had him searching a crowd for a GOP congresswoman who ’ d passed away . Even if we assumed this was an honest mistake — somehow — the incident still demonstrated the faculties of the world ’ s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties were further on display back in September , when Biden tripped all over the words “ reduce the deficit , ” uttering instead something to the effect of “ rededudenedefet. ” It might be diplomatic to overlook such egregious errors in speech , but then it would be hypocritical of leftists to expect as much . One can not forget the origins of the “ stable genius ” meme around President Trump , who rarely made as many verbal or directional mistakes as Biden . Indeed , we can only expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden does , our tolerant left-leaning friends would launch the most excoriating ableist attack on the man in an effort to unseat him . For our part , we don ’ t necessarily think that age or ability should disqualify the man from conducting his duties , but we do wonder if we ’ re asking too much for our president to be able to carry on a conversation ? Not to put too fine a point on it , but shouldn ’ t we also expect our leaders to actually be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than struggling with high school words like “ kleptocracy , ” as Biden recently did ? Other times , he simply loses touch with reality or misremembers or misinterprets events in an extreme way and has no issue relaying what he believes in that moment , as we saw when he declared that his son Beau had in fact perished in Iraq . The growing number of such incidents is what brings cause for concern , of course , with the specter of Vice President Kamala Harris taking over perhaps irking some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do or say . To be fair , Biden and other political leaders of the times experience a microscope that wasn ’ t levied at leaders of the past . We question how far certain leaders would have made it in the polls if various things were known about them — or if their every move was filmed . Regardless , we must have basic standards as a society for those who lead us . While these people should generally represent us , they should also be able to function at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Joe Biden we are increasingly seeing the opposite of that , as the aforementioned gaffes have illustrated . While this country failed to institute a proper opposition to Biden in November ’ s election , Republicans do now have some power to look into the various aspects of the regime . Looking into Biden ’ s health is certainly not off the table , although it may be down the list from certain criminal implications brought on by Biden ’ s son , Hunter . Whatever happens , the American people deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ’ s John Fetterman , who will effectively function as no more than a party puppet , or Joe Biden , the so-called leader of the free world , we as a nation should not be subject to the whims of men who can not adequately make decisions .

Those too young to remember the era would find it hard to believe how terrible internet search was in pre-Google times. In the very early days, when there weren’t that many websites at all, curated lists of sites were produced by companies like Yahoo. Then came attempts at mechanically indexing sites, like AltaVista, but those were easily gamed. Then came Google, which figured out that it could use websites’ links to one another to create a metric of importance that then informed its search results. Looking for information about cars? Well, this website about cars is linked by more sites than any other and has the most people vouching for it — so it goes at the top of the list. This is obviously an oversimplification, but the central point remains important. Google built a business around getting people off its site.

They said a bipartisan vote would send a positive message to the country and that Judge Jackson is a deserving nominee . “ I think she ’ s going to defy some expectations , ” Sen. Amy Klobuchar , Minnesota Democrat , told “ Fox News Sunday. ” Judge Jackson , 51 , would replace liberal Justice Stephen G. Breyer , who is retiring . She worked as his law clerk decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Senate will decide if I fill your seat . But please know that I could never fill your shoes , ” Judge Jackson said after Mr. Biden presented her at a White House ceremony on Friday . Before joining the D.C . Circuit , Judge Jackson spent eight years on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , where she issued more than 500 opinions . Judge Jackson credited God and her faith in her Friday speech . “ I must begin these very brief remarks by thanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my professional journey . My life has been blessed beyond measure , ” she said . “ I do know that one can only come this far by faith. ” The president , who had promised to nominate a Black woman , said diversity was important in his decision . “ For too long , our government , our courts haven ’ t looked like America , ” Mr. Biden said . “ I believe it is time we have a court that reflects the full talents and greatness of our nation. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominee who understands that “ the law must work for the American people. ” Judge Jackson said she was inspired to pursue a legal career after her father went to law school . She said he was her first professional role model . Judge Jackson also honored the late Judge Constance Baker Motley , the first Black woman to serve as a federal judge . “ I can only hope that my life and career , my love of this country and the Constitution and my commitment to upholding the rule of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great nation was founded will inspire future generations of Americans , ” she said . Mr. Durbin ’ s committee is expected to hold hearings for Judge Jackson in the coming weeks . Senators will quiz her over her rulings ahead of a confirmation vote . Sen . Rob Portman , Ohio Republican , said he doesn ’ t expect the confirmation process to be as contentious as the one around Justice Brett Kavanaugh during the Trump administration , given the makeup of the Senate and the high court . “ As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another liberal on the court . And Democrats have 50 votes , and plus one with the vice president , they have the ability to confirm , ” Mr. Portman told NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press. ” “ But I think the rest of us on the Republican side are going to be looking at her record , look at her qualifications . We don ’ t believe you ought to legislate from the bench . We think the Supreme Court focus ought to be on protecting our rights and following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we ’ ll be looking for. ” House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn , South Carolina Democrat , said Sunday that he would like the Senate to confirm Judge Jackson on a bipartisan vote because it would signal that the U.S. is earnest about forming a more perfect union . “ This is beyond politics , ” Mr. Clyburn told CBS ’ s “ Face the Nation. ” “ I would hope that all of my Republican friends look upon it that way . “ In the final analysis , let ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate that both parties are still in pursuit of perfection , ” he said . Sen. Mitt Romney , Utah Republican , said he is open to voting for Judge Jackson despite voting against her nomination to serve on the circuit court . “ Look , her nomination and her confirmation would or will be historic , and like anyone nominated by the president of the United States , she deserves a very careful look , a very deep dive , ” Mr. Romney told CNN ’ s “ State of the Union. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to that evaluation and hope that I will be able to support her in the final analysis. ” Other Republicans have signaled that they will oppose Judge Jackson . They dubbed her the favored choice of “ far left ” and “ dark money ” groups . Seemingly with an eye on her confirmation hearing , Judge Jackson took the unusual step Friday of acknowledging that one of her uncles , Thomas Brown Jr. , had been sentenced to life imprisonment in Florida for a drug conviction under a “ three strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read that I have one uncle who got caught up in the drug trade and received a life sentence . That is true , ” she said . “ But law enforcement also runs in my family. ” She noted that her brother has served as a police officer in Baltimore and two other uncles worked in law enforcement . One became police chief in Miami . As a lawyer , Judge Jackson helped bring the case of her imprisoned uncle to the attention of the Obama White House . President Obama commuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson as a protector of freedom and democracy . He noted the backdrop of war in Ukraine , where he said freedom is under threat . “ Her opinions are always perfectly reasoned , ” Mr. Biden said . “ It doesn ’ t mean she puts her thumb on the scale one way or the other . She cares about making sure democracy works for the American people . She strives to be fair , to get it right. ” Judge Jackson has impressed liberals with her rulings in cases against former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they say is a record of reaching beyond her authority as a judge . She ruled against Mr. Trump ’ s attempt to conceal White House records concerning the Jan. 6 , 2021 , riot at the U.S. Capitol . She also sided with congressional Democrats in their attempt to get former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify in their impeachment inquiries against Mr. Trump . In 2017 , Judge Jackson sentenced the “ pizzagate ” shooter to four years in prison . The case involved a pizza parlor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Carolina opened fire . A false right-wing conspiracy theory circulating online claimed the restaurant was at the center of a child sex abuse ring involving influential Democrats . Experts long viewed the Harvard Law School graduate as a front-runner for Mr. Biden ’ s high court pick even before Justice Breyer announced his plan to retire . Mr. Clyburn said he is ready to look beyond the fact that Mr. Biden chose Judge Brown instead of his first choice , J. Michelle Childs , a U.S. district judge in South Carolina who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League . “ We all have our personal preference . We all have our reasonable biases . But in the final analysis , I think this was a good choice , ” Mr. Clyburn said . Judge Jackson has a wide range of experience as a lawyer in private practice and as an assistant federal public defender . She also served on the U.S . Sentencing Commission . Shortly after the president vowed to fill a vacancy on the high court with a Black woman , Mr. Biden elevated Judge Jackson from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The D.C. appellate court is considered a steppingstone to the high court . Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and Justice Clarence Thomas — a third of the current justices on the bench — sat on the D.C . Circuit before their nominations . Judge Jackson was confirmed to the U.S . Sentencing Commission , the district court and the circuit court with bipartisan support . Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , said Judge Jackson will protect the rights of the “ voiceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden on undertaking a thoughtful , deliberate selection process for the next Supreme Court Justice . Senate Democrats will work to ensure a fair , timely , and expeditious process — fair to the nominee , to the Senate , and to the American public , ” Mr. Schumer said . Senate Republicans said they will be ready for a fair confirmation process for Judge Jackson . The top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa , said he looks forward to meeting with Judge Jackson . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of degrading the advice and consent role as Senate Democrats have in recent confirmations , ” he said . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , also said he wanted to avoid the types of controversial hearings in recent years when Democrats and liberal advocates protested the confirmations of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and Justice Amy Coney Barrett . Justice Kavanaugh was accused — without proof — of sexual misconduct dating back decades . Democrats told the American people that Justice Barrett would take away their health insurance . “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country deserve better than Senate Democrats ’ routine of baseless smears and shameless distortions , ” Mr. McConnell said . He noted that he voted against Judge Jackson ’ s confirmation to the D.C . Circuit . “ Since then , I understand that she has published a total of two opinions , both in the last few weeks , and that one of her prior rulings was just reversed by a unanimous panel of her present colleagues on the D.C . Circuit . I also understand Judge Jackson was the favored choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years attacking the legitimacy and structure of the court itself , ” he said . One of Judge Jackson ’ s rulings while on the D.C . Circuit , American Federation of Government Employees v. Federal Labor Relations Authority , involved a 2020 rule that limited collective bargaining for government employees . She ruled for the union in that legal battle . Her other opinion , Wye Oak Technology v. Republic of Iraq , involved a defense contractor and procedural issues .

Judge Jackson is married to a doctor whom she met while at Harvard . They have two children . She is a distant relative of former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

In response, he angrily writes a caricaturish Black satire chock-a-block with racist stereotypes.

Three people suffering from cancer are set to face off against Monsanto in the latest courtroom battle over allegations that exposure to the company ’ s Roundup weed killer causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma . The trial will be the first to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hometown , with jury selection set to start on March 24 . ( A previous trial in St. Louis was cancelled just hours before it was scheduled to begin due to a settlement agreement . ) The trial will focus on the complaints of three individuals : Robert Bird , an Iowa man who sprayed Roundup products routinely on a tree farm ; Blake Buchan , a 39-year-old Georgia man who used Monsanto ’ s products to spray fence lines and other areas of two properties he maintained ; and Ozie Parker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping out on his family farm , mixing and spraying Roundup weed killers on hundreds of acres for many years . The plaintiffs allege that Monsanto was well aware of the risks of the active ingredient in its herbicides – a chemical called glyphosate – but hid the risks from consumers , failing to warn them despite scientific evidence showing the cancer-causing potential of the products . Monsanto denies its products cause cancer , pointing to backing by the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators around the world for the safety of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseen by St. Louis Circuit Court Judge Michael Mullen , and is expected to last about five weeks , according to court spokesman Jacob Long . Germany ’ s Bayer AG bought Monsanto in 2018 , but Monsanto has maintained a large presence in the St. Louis area , and lawyers for both sides have been arguing over whether or not the company ’ s long-standing philanthropic role there could be introduced as evidence of what Monsanto attorneys call the company ’ s “ good character. ” Because the plaintiffs will be seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ “ malicious , evilly motivated ” or otherwise engaged in other bad behavior , “ Monsanto is entitled to put forth mitigating evidence supporting its good character , ” according to a recent court filing . Plaintiffs attorneys , for their part , have warned that if Monsanto tries to curry favor with jurors by speaking of its charitable contributions to the community , or similar acts , they will be entitled to lay out the company ’ s long history of involvement with such things as Agent Orange poisonings and PCB contamination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate court filing on Thursday , lawyers for Monsanto also asked the judge to bar the plaintiffs ’ attorneys from engaging in “ chicanery ” by presenting what Monsanto said would be “ inflammatory ” or “ confusing ” information to jurors . Monsanto specifically said the judge should bar any suggestion that jurors should consider their verdict as sending a message to Monsanto or Bayer ; or comparisons between Roundup and tobacco , among other things . The plaintiffs are among more than 100,000 people in the United States who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company ’ s glyphosate-based herbicides caused them to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma . They all additionally allege that Monsanto was well aware of the risks associated with its weed killers but tried to suppress or discredit information about the dangers . There have been five trials held to date since international cancer scientists declared glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen in 2015 . Monsanto lost the first three trials and won the last two . Bayer has settled several other cases that were scheduled to go to trial over the last few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it would pay roughly $ 11 billion to settle about 100,0000 existing Roundup cancer claims , and later said it would set aside another $ 4.5 billion toward Roundup litigation liability . Bayer also announced it would stop selling Roundup , and other herbicides made with the active ingredient glyphosate , to U.S. consumers by 2023 .

""""""" If you didn ’ t know who Tudor Dixon was before August , few would blame you . A former steel factory executive and right-wing cable news host , Dixon was a little-known candidate in a crowded field for Michigan ’ s Republican primary race for governor when she announced her bid in May 2021 . But after several of her competitors were disqualified ( for including fake signatures on nominating petitions , mostly ) and after she secured some coveted endorsements ( including Donald Trump ’ s ) , Dixon surged ahead to win the primary , setting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gretchen Whitmer in November . The race between the two is expected to be close . A breast cancer survivor who has said vaccination should be a “ personal choice , ” Dixon has said her choice to run was motivated by her anger at Whitmer ’ s strict COVID shutdown policies . She has run on firmly right-wing stances on issues such as abortion ( she ’ s against it ) , education about gender identity in schools ( she ’ s called it “ indoctrination ” ) , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged the results ) . But long before her foray into conservative politics , Dixon was briefly an actress . Between 2008 and 2012 , Dixon acted in several low-budget horror productions made in Kalamazoo , Michigan . Much of it has now been scrubbed from the Internet ( or was never available online in the first place ) , but the easiest one to find in full is the gloriously raunchy , deeply unserious teen-sex-horror-comedy-zombie film , Buddy BeBop vs. the Living Dead . What exactly this movie is about is unclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The film—released in 2009 and available on Roku and Amazon Prime Video ( where I watched it ) —takes place in a 1950s Americana town populated solely by greasers and teenage girls in poodle skirts . It opens typically enough for a horror movie—with two teens hooking up in a car . But things quickly take a turn for the bizarre when the couple is attacked by a group of zombies immediately after the greaser gets a blow job . ( “ If I was a smoking man , now would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ’ s last words . ) What follows is essentially a Marilyn Manson fan cam , with slow panning black-and-white shots of zombies in heavily rimmed eyeliner shoving guts into their mouths as heavy metal blares in the background . For a horror movie , it ’ s not that scary , and for a comedy , it ’ s not very funny . And for some reason , the whole thing is shot in black and white . That might have come across as a nod to the 1968 classic Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bizarre choice to colorize random objects like a main character ’ s bright red shirt , the ketchup-and-mustard paint scheme of a roller skating rink , and the garish yellow car the teens are canoodling in at the beginning of the film . Cue the intro credits , and we smash cut to Buddy BeBop , an uncool high schooler with dreams of becoming a rock ’ n ’ roll musician . When we first meet him , Buddy is getting ready for a musical performance at the town roller rink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , the roller rink quickly turns into a battleground , forcing Buddy and the teeny boppers to fight for their lives . It ’ s in a field outside this roller rink where Dixon ’ s character has her brief but dramatic moment in the spotlight . Clad in a sweater vest and Mary Janes , Dixon ’ s character has no lines and only appears for a few seconds before she is tackled to the ground and brutally devoured by two zombies . The camera pushes in on her screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down her ankle , putting a swift end to the now-gubernatorial-candidate ’ s sole appearance in the film . ( In the credits , her character is referred to only as “ Tag Teamed Bopper. ” ) Elvis shows up in the film ’ s final act , sent by the vice president of the United States to protect Buddy ’ s town . Elvis has apparently brought with him some kind of cure for zombie-fication — except he only has one dose . How was Elvis supposed to save an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose of zombie cure ? That is not clear . He also fails miserably at it . Questions abound after the final credits roll . Why did they colorize the blood on one victim ’ s face , but not any blood on the zombies ? Why do only some characters have deep Southern accents ? Why did the vice president entrust Elvis to save a town from zombies ? Like the Loch Ness monster or the Easter Island statues , these are just life ’ s unanswered mysteries . ​​ ” Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer to that . No , it ’ s not , ” said Chad Ream , a producer of Buddy BeBop , in an interview with the Detroit News in May . “ Does it have some funny parts ? It depends how you find humor. ” That wasn ’ t the end of Dixon ’ s acting career , by the way . Her most substantial role was in a web series called Transitions , an online vampire TV show released in 2010 with some very 2000s-era flat-ironed hair and eyeliner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is , amazingly , British . Little evidence remains for us to assess her accent , however , since the show ’ s creators took almost every episode down from YouTube in early May . Now all that ’ s left exists in clips and screengrabs—Dixon whirling a sword , buttoning up her shirt , applying dark lipstick suggestively in a mirror , and shouting “ Do I have your attention now ? ” in what kind of sounds like a British accent . Dixon ’ s past life as a low-budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May . But as her campaign started to pick up steam , clips of her appearances on Transitions took off on Twitter and were weaponized by her opponents almost immediately . “ Vampire porn actress , ” one pundit called her . “ They were almost as scary as her dangerous agenda , ” the Michigan Democratic Party declared of her movies in an attack ad against her . Critics called her hypocritical for promoting family values and a hardline stance against “ sexually explicit ” education—she has said she would criminalize adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that schools should not “ normalize ” discussions about gender identity or sexuality—when she had clearly participated in projects that were both violent and sexually suggestive . ( Buddy BeBop , while not exactly explicit , does have a lot of horny teenagers getting it on in weird ways . At one point , two teens literally foam at the mouth doing it doggy style while shouting “ Put it in my butt ! ” in the bathroom of a roller rink . ) And Buddy BeBop ’ s zombies are deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ’ s belly , tearing into teenagers ’ entrails at the roller rink , licking blood off linoleum floors , and—my personal favorite—biting a pervy middle-aged man ’ s dick off . Her 2008 film LexiBaby—about which the Kalamazoo Gazette said , “ There is a good movie somewhere ” in it , adding that scenes with cocaine were distracting because they were “ too obviously grains of sugar ” —also prompted accusations of hypocrisy . Dixon plays a character named Emma , described on the film ’ s website as “ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off as a nice person , ” but who is apparently also “ self-centered , ” with destructive behavior . In the only clips left online , which are from the trailer , the viewer sees shots of Dixon ’ s character watching as her boyfriend does lines of cocaine before she straddles him and lifts her shirt . Dixon has said she has never seen Buddy BeBop and never seriously considered acting as a career . She ’ s also rejected suggestions that her old film projects undermine her public platforms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made for adults and was different from something children could access—though clips of her work are still easily accessible online , and Buddy BeBop is still available to anyone with internet and $ 5 to spare . A random stint in low-budget B-movies is unlikely to derail Dixon ’ s run . But the revelation of her acting past is just another reflection of how strange Michigan ’ s gubernatorial race has become and how poisonous primary election campaigns can get—as well as a reminder that several political hopefuls this election cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including on daytime TV . It remains to be seen whether Buddy BeBop and his horny zombies will feature in future campaigns against Dixon , or whether all this will just become a footnote in the story of yet another messy , petty political campaign for a battleground state in the post-Trump years . Still , not everyone knows Dixon as a politician . When I reached out to Jon Petro , one of the producers on LexiBaby , in early August , he was unaware Dixon was running for governor and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be calling about her . “ Oh yeah , that ’ s right , how ’ s she doing ? ” Petro said , once I explained . “ I just saw a sign about that. ” This was nine days after she had won the Republican primary . I told him this . “ Holy—wow , ” Petro said , pausing . “ I had no idea she had gotten that far . ” """"""",0
"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk declared the beginning of a new era for his country after opposition parties appeared to have won enough votes in Sunday’s parliamentary election to oust the governing nationalist conservative party. That party, Law and Justice, has bickered with allies and faced accusations of eroding rule of law at home in its eight years in power. It appeared that voters were mobilized like never before, voting in even greater numbers than when the nation ousted the communist authorities in 1989.

"THE leading Israeli paper Haaretz comments: “Thanks to the funnelling of millions of Qatari dollars to Gaza, with Netanyahu’s repeated approval as part of a deliberate, malicious policy aimed at burying the two-state solution, Hamas acquired inordinate military capabilities.” This refers to a meeting of the Israeli premier’s Likud party in which Benjamin Netanayu explained to his party’s dullards that the strategic aim of preventing a two-state solution to the decades-old conflict depended on provoking the highest level of disunity among Palestinians. Thus the Islamic charity that begat Hamas was covertly supported by Israel against the secular and left-wing forces in the Palestine national movement.",1

"Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy called transgenderism a mental health disorder. The Republican said in a debate that affirming a “kid’s confusion” is not compassionate but cruel. Ramaswamy in a post on X, formerly Twitter, shared the clip of him addressing the issue. “More than 50 per cent of kids with gender dysphoria have considered suicide. And yet politicians reject a law that would require schools to inform parents if their kids change their gender identity at school. Parents have a right to know about their kids: that shouldn’t be controversial. Ban genital mutilation & puberty blockers before age 18. Treat gender dysphoria as a mental health disorder. Time to empower parents again,” he said in the post. In the video Ramaswamy shared with the post, he can be seen saying, “I have to be very clear about this. Transgenderism, especially in kids, is a mental health disorder.

Its lawmakers and regulators have significantly restricted oil exploration in recent years and have increased efforts to decarbonize and introduce renewables to the state . However , recent accusations around California ’ s leaking methane , legislator donations from Big Oil , and the state ’ s ongoing backing of natural gas have made many question the merit of its status as a clean energy state . California has announced several plans to curb its oil operations in recent years . Earlier in 2022 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phasing out of drilling in the city , using $ 165 million in federal funds to seal abandoned wells across the state .

But it received criticism for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area with a large population , in its ban . However , oil industry experts highlight the ongoing need to import crude to the oil-rich region and the reliance the state has had on Russia in the past , suggesting that sourcing energy locally will contribute to greater energy security . Amid criticism over environmental damage , with a recent report revealing Texas , Ohio , and California as the states most under threat by oil and gas pollution , California must tread carefully if it hopes to maintain its green reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map highlights the main areas at risk , which include scattered areas across the state . In addition , the Government of California has recently come under fire for failing to plug oil and gas wells , with 21 oil wells found to be leaking high levels of methane .

California 's top oil regulator , Uduak-Joe Ntuk , was accused of lying about the severity of the leaks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quick to respond to the issue , putting pressure on California Geologic Energy Management Division ( CalGEM ) to plug the leaks and vowing to invest $ 300 million in the closing of any other methane leaks .

Much like the EU , California sees gas as key to a clean energy transition away from fossil fuels . Pacific Gas & Electric , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility , announced this month that it plans to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 while maintaining its natural gas use . This , the report vaguely suggests , will be done by introducing carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) technologies to operations .

A significant proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private businesses switch their old diesel truck fleets to newer diesel engines or natural gas trucks and infrastructure . The regulator suggested that electric vehicles were simply too expensive , making natural gas the cleanest alternative . Despite ex-governor Jerry Brown pledging to lead the U.S. response to climate change on a 2017 trip to Europe ; California ’ s 2045 net-zero pledge ; and a 2035 ban on the sale of new ICE cars , several of the states ’ long-standing policies contradict these aims .

""""""" Few people today ask the most important question about the conflict between Russia and Ukraine . Many people want America to stay out of the fight , but even they don ’ t ask the vital question . Why does the world face a crisis today ? Why has a border dispute between Russia and Ukraine escalated to the point where people fear nuclear war ? The answer is simple . America , under the “ leadership ” of brain-dead Biden and the forces controlling him , has done this and , by doing so , brought the world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the great Dr. Ron Paul gets it right : “ Three weeks into this terrible war , the US is not pursuing talks with Russia . As Antiwar.com recently reported , instead of supporting negotiations between Ukraine and Russia that could lead to a ceasefire and an end to the bloodshed , the US government is actually escalating the situation which can only increase the bloodshed . The constant flow of US and allied weapons into Ukraine and talk of supporting an extended insurgency does not seem designed to give Ukraine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand Russia what Secretary of State Blinken called ‘ a strategic defeat. ’ It sounds an awful lot like the Biden Administration intends to fight Russia down to the last Ukrainian . The only solution for the US is to get out . Let the Russians and Ukrainians reach an agreement . That means no NATO for Ukraine and no US missiles on Russia ’ s borders ? So what ! End the war then end NATO. ” Let ’ s look at an analogy that will help us understand Dr. Paul ’ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian government has attacked an area in the Donbas region that has seceded from Ukraine and formed an independent , pro-Russian , republic . Just before Putin moved against Ukraine , Ukraianians increased the scale and scope of their attack . Rick Rozoff describes what they did : “ Two-thirds of Ukrainian army servicemen have been amassed along the Donbas contact line , Eduard Basurin , spokesman for the self-proclaimed Donetsk People ’ s Republic ( DPR ) militia , said on Thursday . “ Another three brigades are on their way [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 25,000 troops more . The total number will reach 150,000 , not to mention the nationalists . This is about two-thirds of Ukrainian Armed Forces ’ personnel , ” Basurin said on the Rossiya 1 television channel ( VGTRK ) on Thursday . Ukrainian troops are stationed along the 320-kilometer front line , he said. ” Unlike what has just happened , the Ukrainian attack did not result in US sanctions on Ukraine . There were no meetings of the UN to condemn Ukrainian aggression . There was no talk of world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government used American weapons in its attack and asked America for more weapons to continue their attack . Let ’ s listen to Rick Rozoff again : “ The Armed Forces of Ukraine used the American anti-tank missile system Javelin in the hostilities in Donbas . This was announced by the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Kirill Budanov in an interview… . Budanov said that ideally , the U.S. would help deter any Russian incursion , through additional military aid and increased diplomatic and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the seizure and blocking of Russian banking accounts . Also , in addition to U.S. aid already promised and delivered , including Mark VI patrol boats , Javelin anti-armor systems and AN/TPQ-53 light counter-fire radar systems , Ukraine seeks additional air , missile and drone defense systems and electronic jamming devices , Budonov said . Patriot missile batteries and counter rocket , artillery and mortar systems are on Ukraine ’ s wish list . The AN/TPQ-53 systems were used to great effect , Ukraine military officials have previously reported . Budanov said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Russian forces . Those , along with Turkish-manufactured drones , used against Russian-aligned separatist artillery troops , have a significant psychological deterrent value , said Budanov. ” Why the difference ? We think that the US should not have shipped arms to Ukraine . Doing this made the situation worse . But for what we ’ re saying now , it doesn ’ t matter what you think of the policy . The key point is that because there was no international outcry and no sanctions , the matter remained a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gang had reacted to the so-called Russian “ invasion ” in the same way , the matter would have remained a local quarrel . Russia and Ukraine would have made a deal and that would be that . The neocon warmongers and other defenders of “ democracy , ” who unfortunately include some deluded “ libertarians ” object . Don ’ t we have a duty to resist “ aggression ? ” The answer is clear : No , we don ’ t . We do not have a duty to evaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fault . We do not have a duty to require leaders of regimes we , or rather our masters in Washington , don ’ t like to accept existing boundaries of countries as unchangeable . We should reject the false doctrine of “ collective security , ” which makes every border disputes a world war . The great American historian Charles Beard recognized what was wrong with “ collective security ” in the 1930s . In his article , “ Giddy Minds and Foreign Quarrels , ” he asked : “ On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States be based ? Here is one answer and it is not excogitated in any professor ’ s study or supplied by political agitators . It is the doctrine formulated by George Washington , supplemented by James Monroe , and followed by the Government of the United States until near the end of the nineteenth century , when the frenzy for foreign adventurism burst upon the country . This doctrine is simple . Europe has a set of ‘ primary interests ’ which have little or no relation to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rivalship , interest , humor , or caprice. ’ The United States is a continental power separated from Europe by a wide ocean which , despite all changes in warfare , is still a powerful asset of defense . In the ordinary or regular vicissitudes of European politics the United States should not become implicated by any permanent ties . We should promote commerce , but force ‘ nothing. ’ We should steer dear of hates and loves . We should maintain correct and formal relations with all established governments without respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Christian , Mohammedan , Shinto , or what have you. ” Beard then responded to those who wanted to scrap our traditional policy of non-intervention with “ collective security ” : “ In the rest of the world , outside this hemisphere , our interests are remote and our power to enforce our will is relatively slight . Nothing we can do for Europeans will substantially increase our trade or add to our , or their , well-being . Nothing we can do for Asiatics will materially increase our trade or add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With all countries in Europe and Asia , our relations should be formal and correct . As individuals we may indulge in hate and love , but the Government of the United States embarks on stormy seas when it begins to love one power and hate another officially. ” We should heed Beard ’ s wisdom today . Otherwise , the world may go up in flames . The Best of Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr . """"""",1
""""""" In January , citizen journalist Brian Lupo wrote an exceptional piece on the activities of the American left in the 2020 election . Lupo ’ s report focuses on the left ’ s use of voter rolls in their 2020 plan to defeat President Trump at all costs . We now know that their road to victory involved several shady and many illegal activities . But access to voter rolls was central to their game plan . And Democrats knew they needed voter rolls stuffed with illegitimate voters for their plans to work out . We will hear more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats counted on systems like ERIC and access to real-time voting data to make their plan work . It is no surprise that ten years ago Barack Obama targeted election integrity organization True the Vote . Democrats know it ’ s harder to cheat with cleaned-up voter rolls . This report was initially reported at UndercoverDC . We are reposting a part of that report here with permission from the author . ** You can read the entire piece at UndercoverDC . TRENDING : Exclusive Letter from Oath Keepers Founder Stewart Rhodes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma In the 2020 election , an organization co-founded by a 2018 Obama Foundation Fellow and an acting secretary who volunteered for the Obama campaign in Ohio in 2008 , with $ 3.7 million in revenues in 2019 was awarded $ 350 million by the Zuckerbergs . The money was disproportionately distributed to liberal strongholds over conservative ones . We found out during the Pima Co. AZ hearing that some of the money was allocated after the election ( Pima Co. received its $ 950,000 on 10 November ) . CEIR executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ database “ ERIC ” that is used in 29 states and DC and contains over 17 million voter records , received $ 69.5 million from Zuckerberg . We know those funds went disproportionately to PA , MI , AZ , GA . These four states received over half of the $ 65 million awarded to 23 states . They averaged $ 8.75 million per state while the remaining 19 states averaged $ 1.58 million per state . Ironically and purely coincidentally : these four states , all red states in 2016 and AZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung blue in the 2020 election after long , drawn-out counts with interim vote dumps and shutdowns on Nov. 3 . As more and more unfolds in this investigation , one thing is evident : the 2020 election was exactly as Molly Ball described it in her TIME Magazine piece “ The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election. ” “ That ’ s why the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told , even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream–a well-funded cabal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideologies , working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions , change rules and laws , steer media coverage and control the flow of information . They were not rigging the election ; they were fortifying it . And they believe the public needs to understand the system ’ s fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures. ” We know an election official in at least one state resigned from his post to take a lucrative contract to oversee elections and then returned to his Office of the Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election vendor was paid handsomely for and given seemingly unfettered access to election equipment to perform tasks specifically designated to election officials . We know there were ballot marking devices that seem to have gone without or with limited Logic and Accuracy testing in a county that did a last-minute court-authorized update days before in-person voting began . In that same county , we have a non-profit ’ s lawyers who seem to have access to real-time voting roll updates . And there was allegedly an effort to develop a backdoor portal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know there is an election vendor who is referred to by a top county election official as a “ partner , not a vendor ” that prints ballots , mails them out , receives them back and stores them on a county ’ s behalf . This same vendor delivered over 700,000 “ no stub ” mail-in ballots to a county across the country just days before 11/3 . We know that a tech mogul whose platform censored conservative voices over the last year and suppressed information from credible mainstream outlets about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ” donated $ 400 million to two non-profits that were founded by partisan democrats . We know those two organizations , either directly or indirectly , seem to have had access to the voter rolls prior to , during , and potentially after the 2020 election and contracted with other non-profits , one of which was founded by a Democrat Secretary of State . We know that the private equity firm that owns one of the election vendors received $ 400 million in a direct offering from a foreign bank the month before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most of the election equipment vendors are owned by private equity firms . What does all of this mean ? It means our elections have been privatized . These organizations acting in a private capacity to manipulate and shape our elections are impervious to any citizen oversight in the form of FOIA requests . The access and extent of these companies ’ involvement directly in our elections are unknown as each time routers and Splunk logs are to be made available , some cosmic force seems to stop the process dead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Supervisors refused to hand them over . In Antrim Co. , the case was dismissed on standing the day the routers were to be turned over in discovery . And our politicians , the benefactors of such manipulations , want us to pull the shades down and ignore the chaos in our streets , in our schools , in our businesses , and in our courts . They seem to encourage , or at least refuse to act , on the censorship of information on public town squares . Social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acting with impunity to the Constitutional rights of Free Speech and Assembly . Remember : according to Rasmussen , 56 percent of voters believe fraud impacted the 2020 election . 84 percent of the GOP and 32 percent of Democrats . It is worth noting , in regards to FOIAable documents , that a court ruled in Arizona that Cyber Ninjas , as a contractor of the state senate , must hand over private communications within their organization . Why isn ’ t the same oversight being afforded to companies like Runbeck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a vendor ” by a Maricopa election official and stored returned mail-in ballots at their facility ? Or VoteAtHome , who worked directly with election officials to develop an app to monitor ballots in real-time , and essentially forced an election official in Wisconsin to quit her post because of their overbearing involvement ? Keep in mind , Michael Spitzer-Rubenstein of VoteAtHome was reported as having his own keys to the building where ballots were stored . Or Dominion Voting , who was contracted with an apparent verbal agreement to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County to the tune of $ 2,000 per person per day for a grand total of approximately $ 2,000,000 ?
